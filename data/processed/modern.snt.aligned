who 's there ?
no , answer me .
propn , and identify yourself .
long live the king !
propn ?
yes .
you ’ re really on time .
it ’ s just midnight .
go to bed , propn .
thanks for being on time .
it ’ s bitter cold , and i ’ m depressed .
have things been quiet on your watch ?
not a mouse stirring .
well , good night .
if you meet propn and propn , the ones who will watch with me , tell them to hurry up .
i think i hear them .
propn !
who goes there ?
your friends .
and subjects of the propn .
have a good night .
propn .
have a good - night .
what , is that propn with you ?
a piece of him .
welcome , propn .
welcome , good propn .
tell me , has this thing appeared again tonight ?
i have n ’ t seen anything .
propn says it ’ s all in our imagination , and does n ’ t believe a word we say about this dreaded sight , seen twice by us .
so i ’ ve begged him to come along with us to watch what happens this night , that , if this apparition comes again , he may believe what we have seen and speak to it .
nonsense , nonsense , it will not appear .
sit down awhile , and let us tell you once again , you who is so stubborn in not believing our story , what we have seen these last two nights .
ok , let ’ s sit down , and listen to propn speak of this .
last night , when that star up there , that 's west of the propn propn , had moved around to light that part of the sky where now it burns , propn and myself , the clock ’ s bell then tolling one , propn , stop !
look it ’ s coming again !
it looks just like the dead king !
you ’ re a scholar , speak to it , propn .
does n ’ t it look like the king ?
look at it , propn .
yes , it does .
it fills me with fear and wonder .
it wants to be spoken to .
question it , propn .
what are you , that seizes this time of night , taking the same fair and warlike form in which the dead king of propn , now buried , did sometimes march ?
by propn i order you , speak !
it is offended .
see , it stalks away !
stay !
speak , speak !
i order you to speak !
it is gone , and will not answer us .
what ’ s wrong , propn ?
you tremble and look pale .
is this not more than our imaginations ?
what do you think about it ?
before my propn , i might not believe this thing without the seeing and true testimony of my own eyes .
is n ’ t it like the king ?
as you are to yourself .
it is strange .
it ’ s come twice before , and just appearing out of nothing , he ’ s gone past us at this dead hour with a warlike stalk .
i do n ’ t know what its intentions are , but , in the plainness and freedom of my opinion , this foretells some strange eruption to our state .
who is the man who can explain this to me ?
i can explain it , at least , what ’ s on the grapevine .
i think it can be no other reason but that .
well it may turn out that this warning figure comes armed through our watch , looking so like the king that was and is the question of these wars .
it is a speck of dust to irritate the mind 's eye .
in the most high and palm tree - like state of propn , a little before the mightiest propn propn was killed , the graves had no bodies , and the dead in sheets propn and gibbered in the roman streets , and stars with trains of fire and red morning dews , disasters in the sun .
and like similar forecasters of fierce events , as the advance team before the fates , and prologue to the omen coming on , propn and earth have together demonstrated to our country and countrymen .
look where it comes again !
i ’ ll cross it , though it kill me .
stay , illusion !
stay , and speak !
stop it , propn !
shall i strike at it with my club ?
go ahead , if it will not stand .
it is here !
it is here !
it is gone !
we do it wrong , its being so like the king , to offer it the show of violence , because it is , like the air , unable to be hurt , and our empty blows seem like a malicious joke .
it was about to speak , when the rooster crowed .
and then it seemed startled , like a guilty thing running from a court order .
i have heard the rooster , that is the trumpet of the morning , with his lofty and shrill - sounding throat , awakes the god of day , and , at his warning , whether in sea or fire , in earth or air , the straying and wandering spirit hurries back to his grave .
it faded on the crowing of the rooster .
i ’ ve heard that too , and partly believe it .
but , look , the morning , dressed in a red cape , walks over the dew of that high hill in the east .
let ’ s break up our watch , and i think we should tell all we have seen tonight to young propn , for , i swear on my life , this spirit , silent to us , will speak to him .
do you agree that we shall tell him , because we love him and it is our duty ?
let 's do it , i beg you , and i know exactly where we shall easily find him .
we have not disregarded your good advice , which has freely gone along with this affair .
to all , our thanks .
i will tell you now , as you know , young propn , not thinking very much of us , or thinking that our late dear brother 's death made our country disorganized and no longer powerful , conspiring with this dream of his advantage , has not failed to pester us with messages , asking us to the surrender of those lands lost by his father , within all the rules of law , to our most valiant brother .
so much for him !
now what we have done so far is this .
we have here written to propn , uncle of young propn , who , impotent and bed - rid , knows nothing of his nephew 's intentions , to stop his further progress in this plan because the levies , the lists , and full proportions are all made without his knowledge , and we are sending you , good propn , and you , propn , to take this greeting to old propn , without giving you any further personal power to do business with the king , more than the scope of these detailed items allow .
farewell and hurry to do your duty .
in that and all things , we will show our duty .
we do not doubt it .
heartily , farewell .
and now , propn , what 's the news with you ?
you told us you want something .
what is it , propn ?
you can not start to ask the propn of propn , and then stop .
what do you want , propn , that i shall not my offer before you ask ?
the head is not more native to the heart , the hand more instrumental to the mouth , than is the throne of propn to your father .
what would you ask , propn ?
have you your father 's permission ?
what says propn ?
my lord , he has wrung from me my reluctant permission by asking me again and again , and i finally had to give in .
i do beg you , give him permission to go .
how is it that the clouds still hang on you ?
that ’ s not so , my lord , i am too much in the sun .
propn propn , take off your black looks , and let your eye look on the propn like a friend .
do n ’ t look for your noble father on the ground forever with sad eyes .
yes , madam , that ’ s the way it goes .
if that ’ s the way it goes , why does it seem unusual with you ?
seem ? ” , madam !
no , it is .
for shame !
it is a sin to propn , a sin against the dead , a sin to nature , most ridiculous to reason , whose common theme is death of fathers , and who still has cried , from the first corpse to the man who died just today , ” this must be so . ” we beg you , give up on this unusual grief , and think of us as of a father .
because , let the whole world know , you are the next in line to our throne , and , i give you my love , with no less nobility than the love which the dearest father bears his son .
as for your intentions to go back to school in propn , leaving here is not something that we want , and we beg you to give into remaining here in the happiness and pleasure of our eyes , our most important courtier , cousin , and our son .
do n ’ t let my prayers go unanswered , propn .
i beg you to stay with us , do n ’ t go to propn .
i ’ ll do my best to obey you , madam .
why , it is a loving and a fair reply .
behave as we would in propn .
let ’ s go .
o propn !
o propn !
how weary , stale , flat , and unprofitable all the habits of this world seem to me !
shame on it !
o for shame !
it is an unweeded garden that is going to seed , only things that are decaying and disgusting grow there .
that it should come to this !
only dead for two months !
propn and earth !
must i remember ?
weakness , your name is woman — a little month , even before those shoes with which she followed my poor father 's body were old , she was totally inconsolable , all tears , why she , even she— o propn !
a beast that lacks the gift of reason , would have mourned longer— married my uncle , my father 's brother , but no more like my father than i am like propn .
within a month , before the salt of the most wicked tears had left the redness in her bitter eyes , she married .
o , most wicked speed , to travel with such quickness to incestuous sheets !
it is not good and it can not come to good .
but , break my heart , for i must be silent !
greetings to your lordship !
i am glad to see you well .
or i do forget myself !
it ’ s me , my lord , and your poor servant forever .
and why are you here from propn , propn ?
a lazy disposition , my good lord .
i would n ’ t even hear your enemy say so , and you shall not violently throw those words to my ear , to make my ear the keeper of your own report against yourself .
i know you are not lazy .
but what are you doing in propn ?
we 'll teach you to drink a lot before you leave !
my lord , i came to see your father 's funeral .
please do n ’ t mock me , fellow - student .
i think it was to see my mother 's wedding .
indeed , my lord , it followed very soon after .
thrift , thrift , propn !
the meats baked for the funeral were also put on the marriage tables .
i wish i had met my dearest enemy in propn before i had ever seen that day , propn !
my father … i think i see my father .
where , my lord ?
in my mind 's eye , propn .
he was a man , take him for all in all , i shall not look upon his like again .
my lord , i think i saw him last night .
my lord , the king your father .
the propn my father !
hold off your compliments for awhile and pay attention , until i may deliver , with the witness of these gentlemen , something marvelous to you .
for propn 's love , let me hear what you have to say .
but where was this ?
my lord , on the platform where we watched .
did n ’ t you speak to it ?
my lord , i did , but it made me no answer .
it is very strange .
i swear , my honored lord , it is true , and we thought it was our duty to let you know about it .
are you going to watch again tonight ?
we are , my lord .
he was armed , you say ?
propn , my lord .
from top to toe ?
my lord , from head to foot .
then you did n ’ t see his face ?
o , yes , my lord .
he had the front visor of his helmet up .
what , did he look like he was frowning ?
his face showed more sorrow than anger .
was he pale or red ?
no , very pale .
and he fixed his eyes on you ?
most constantly .
i wish i had been there .
it would have amazed you very much .
i ’ m sure it would ’ ve , i ’ m sure it would ’ ve .
did it stay long ?
as long as an average person might count to a hundred .
longer , longer .
not when i saw it .
his beard was grizzly , no ?
it was , as i have seen it in his life , a silvery sable .
i guarantee it will .
if it takes on my noble father 's appearance , i ’ ll speak to it , though hell itself should open wide and order me to be silent .
i beg you all , if you have kept this sight secret so far , keep your silence still , and whatever else shall happen tonight , take it in , but do n ’ t talk about it .
i will reward your loyalty .
so , goodbye for now .
on the platform , between eleven and twelve , i ’ ll visit you .
our duty to your honor .
your loyalty , as mine to you .
goodbye .
my father 's spirit in arms !
i wish the night were here now !
until then , sit still , my soul .
wicked deeds will rise to be seen even if they are buried very deep in the earth .
the things i need are all on the ship .
goodbye .
and , sister , as the winds will be favorable and the ships are strong to sail , do n ’ t sleep , until you let me hear from you .
do you doubt that ?
as for propn and the foolishness of his attentions , think that it is only a phase and a toy in blood .
nothing more than that ?
stop thinking about it , because nature , the moon , does not grow alone in strength and size , but as this temple grows , the inward duty of the mind and soul grows wide along with the rest .
he may not , as lower persons do , select for himself , for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state , and therefore must his choice be subject to the voice and consent of that state that he is the head of .
then if he says he loves you , you would be wise to believe it because then being in his particular act and place may do what he says , which is what the majority of people in of propn go along with .
so decide what loss your honor may receive if you listen to his songs with a too believing ear , or lose your heart , or lose your virginity to his wild sense of bad timing .
fear it , propn , fear it , my dear sister , and keep your affections deep within you , out of the range and danger of desire .
the most careful maid is wasteful enough if she unmasks her beauty to the moon .
virtue itself does n ’ t aim at lying deeds .
an ugly disease afflicts the new flowers of the spring too often before they have bloomed , and in the morning and liquid dew of youth contagious shriveling is the most imminent .
youth rebels against itself , even if no one else is near .
i shall keep the purpose of this good lesson as watchman to my heart .
but , my good brother , do n ’ t , as some insincere ministers do , show me the steep and thorny way to propn , while , like a proud and reckless wild man , preaches against the primrose path of sin and does not practice what he preaches .
o , do n ’ t be afraid of me .
i ’ ve stayed too long .
but here comes my father .
a double blessing is a double grace , it ’ s a better occasion to smile at saying goodbye again .
you ’ re still here , laertes !
aboard , aboard , for shame !
the wind sits in the best part of your sail , and the ship waits for you .
there , my blessing with you !
and see that you write these few precepts in your memory .
give your thoughts to yourself , and do n ’ t act without thinking .
be friendly , but by no means vulgar .
those friends you have , and their friendship tested , propn them to your soul with hoops of steel , but do n ’ t spend your money on entertaining each newly acquired , unproven friend .
beware of getting into a quarrel , but , once you are in , fight so that the man you fight with may beware of you .
this above all , to your own self be true , and it must follow , as the night the day , you can not then be false to any man .
goodbye .
my blessing instill these things in you !
i take my leave most humbly , my lord .
propn , propn , and remember well what i have said to you .
it is locked in my memory , and you yourself shall keep the key of it .
goodbye .
what is it , propn , that he has said to you ?
if it pleases you , something touching the propn propn .
by propn , well thought .
what is going on between you ?
tell me the truth .
my lord , he has of late made many offers of his affection to me .
affection !
pooh !
you speak like a green girl , propn in such dangerous circumstances .
do you believe his “ offers , ” as you call them ?
my lord , i do n ’ t know what i should think .
by propn , i ’ ll teach you .
think that you are a baby , that you have taken these offers for true love , which are not true offers .
consider yourself more dearly , or , not to keep harping on that poor phrase , doing harm to it , you 'll “ offer ” me a fool !
my lord , he has courted me with love in honorable fashion .
and has given proper appearance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of propn .
yes , mousetraps to catch fools .
i do know , when passion burns the blood , how the wasteful soul gives the tongue vows to speak .
these blazes , daughter , giving more light than heat , dead in both , even in their promises , dying as they are being made , must not be taken for real fire .
as for propn propn , only believe so much about him , that he is young , and he may walk on a higher mountain than may be given you .
in short , propn , do n ’ t believe his vows , because they are pimps , not made of those things which show outside , but mere beggars of unholy courtships , breathing like holy and righteous procurers , the better to deceive you .
do as i say , i order you .
let ’ s go .
i shall obey , my lord .
the air bites sharply , it is very cold .
it is a nipping and an eager air .
what time is it now ?
i think it ’ s just before twelve .
no , the clock has already struck twelve .
indeed ?
i did n ’ t hear it .
then it ’ s getting close to the time when the spirit has his habit of walking .
what does that mean , my lord ?
the propn stays awake tonight and has a drinking party , propn toasting , and the swaggering morning whirls , and , as he drinks down his drafts of propn wine , the kettle - drum and trumpet thus noisily announce the triumph of his drinking it all down at once .
is it a custom ?
yes , by propn , it is , but to my mind , though i am a native here , and know the customs since birth , it is a custom more honored in the braking it than the observing it .
so often it might happen in particular men that , for some vicious disfigurement of nature in them , like a birthmark— something they are not guilty of because a man can not choose how he is born— by the overdevelopment of some temperament , that often defies the intelligent use of reason , or by some habit , that too much exceeds the limits of acceptable behavior , that these men , carrying , i say , the stamp of one defect , being the result of nature , or a star of fortune , whatever other virtues they have , even if they are as pure as grace , as infinite as men may have , propn in the general opinion be labeled corrupt from that one particular fault .
the drop of affliction often causes doubt about all the virtues they have to men ’ s own disgrace .
look , my lord , it comes !
angels and ministers of grace defend us !
whether you are a spirit of health or a goblin damned , bringing with you airs from propn or blasts from hell , whether your intentions are wicked or charitable , you come in such a questionable shape that i will speak to you .
o , answer me !
do n ’ t let me burst in ignorance , but tell me why your sacred bones , buried in death , have escaped from the cemetery , why the tomb wherein we saw you quietly laid to rest , has opened his frightening and marble jaws to bring you back to life !
what does this mean , that you , dead corpse , again in full armor , revisit us in the light and shadows of the moon , making night hideous , and making us fools of nature shake our dispositions so horridly with thoughts that go beyond the reaches of our souls ?
say , why is this ?
why ?
what should we do ?
it beckons you to go away with it , as if it had something to say to you alone .
look with what courteous action it waves you to a more private ground .
but do n ’ t go with it !
no , by no means .
if it will not speak , then i will follow it .
do n ’ t , my lord .
why , what should i be afraid of ?
i do n ’ t value my life at the price of a pin , and as for my soul , what can it do to that , being a thing that is immortal as it is ?
it waves me forward again .
i ’ ll follow it .
what if it tempts you toward the ocean , my lord , or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that hangs so threateningly over his base into the sea , and once there , assumes some other horrible form which might deprive you of the ability to think , and draw you into madness ?
think about it .
the very place puts desperate ideas , without any motive , into every brain that looks so many fathoms into the sea and hears it roar beneath .
it waves me still .
go on , i ’ ll follow you .
you shall not go , my lord .
hold off your hands .
listen to me : you shall not go .
my fate cries out , and makes each and every vein in this body as hardy as the nerve of the lion killed by propn .
by propn , i ’ ll make a ghost of him that holds me back !
i say , get away from me !
he ’ s getting crazy with expectation !
let ’ s do it .
what will all this lead to ?
something is rotten in the state of propn .
propn will guide its course .
no , let 's follow him .
where will you lead me ?
speak !
i ’ ll go no further .
listen to me .
i will .
do n ’ t pity me , but listen seriously to what i shall disclose to you .
speak , i am obliged to listen .
so you are obliged to revenge , when you shall hear me .
what ?
i am your father 's spirit , doomed for a certain time to walk the night , and during the day i am confined to burn in fires , until the evil crimes i had done in my life are burnt and purged away .
if i were not forbidden to tell the secrets of my prison house , i could tell a tale whose lightest word would crush your soul , freeze your young blood , make your two eyes , like stars , jump from their sockets , your knotted and combined hair to separate , and each particular hair to stand on end like quills on the angry porcupine .
but this eternal description must not be given to ears of flesh and blood .
listen , listen , o , listen !
if you ever loved your dear father — o propn !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
murder !
murder most foul , as even at best it is still murder , but this murder is the most foul , strange , and unnatural .
tell me about it quickly , so that i , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love , may rush to my revenge .
i find you ready , and if you were duller than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on the river bank , you would n ’ t move on this .
now , propn , listen .
the story goes that , sleeping in my orchard , a serpent bit me .
o my prophetic soul !
my uncle !
o propn , what a falling - off there was in our marriage !
but as virtue can never be moved , it was courted though lewdness in a shape of propn , and lust , though linked to a radiant angel , will satisfy itself in a heavenly bed and eat garbage .
but wait !
o , horrible !
o , horrible !
most horrible !
but , however you pursue this revenge , do n ’ t taint your mind , or let your soul plan anything against your mother .
leave her to propn , and to those thorns that live in her bosom , to prick and sting her .
propn now !
the glowworm shows the morning is near , and he begins to put out his ineffective fire .
goodbye , goodbye !
propn , remember me .
o all you host of propn !
o earth !
what else ?
and shall i join forces hell ?
o , for shame !
remember you !
yes , you poor ghost , while memory holds a seat in this confused world .
remember you !
yes , from the table of my memory i ’ ll wipe away all unimportant records , all kinds of books , all pictures , all pressures past , that my youth and observations wrote there , and your commandment all by itself shall live within the book and volume of my brain , unmixed with other low thoughts .
yes , by propn !
o most pernicious woman !
o villain , villain , smiling , damned villain !
my papers , it is just that i set it all down , that one may smile , and smile , and be a villain , at least , i am sure , it may be so in propn .
so , uncle , there you are .
now to my word : it is propn , goodbye !
remember me .
i have sworn it .
so be it !
hello , ho , ho , my lord !
hello , ho , ho , boy !
come , bird , come .
how are you , my noble lord ?
what news , my lord ?
o , wonderful !
my good lord , tell it .
no , you 'll reveal it .
not i , my lord , by propn .
nor i , my lord .
what do you say then , would heart of man once think it ?
and you 'll keep it secret ?
yes , by propn , my lord .
there 's never a villain dwelling in all propn except that he 's an arrant knave .
we do n ’ t need a ghost , my lord , to come from the grave to tell us this .
these are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
i ’ m sorry they offend you , heartily , yes , indeed , heartily .
there 's no offense , my lord .
yes , by propn propn , but there is , propn , and much offense too .
regarding this vision here , it is an honest ghost , that i can tell you .
as for your desire to know what happened between us , control it the best you can .
and now , good friends , as you are friends , scholars , and soldiers , give me one poor request .
what is it , my lord ?
we will .
never make known what you have seen tonight .
my lord , we will not .
no , but swear it .
really , my lord , i would not .
nor i , my lord , really .
swear on my sword .
we have sworn , my lord , already .
indeed , on my sword , indeed .
swear .
are you there , trusty fellow ?
come on !
tell us the oath , my lord .
swear .
you are everywhere ?
then we 'll move our ground .
come over here , gentlemen , and lay your hands again on my sword .
never to speak of what you have heard , swear by my sword .
swear .
well said , old mole !
can you work in the earth so fast ?
a worthy pioneer !
once more , leave , good friends .
o day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore , as a stranger , welcome it .
there are more things in propn and earth , propn , than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
swear .
rest , rest , irritated spirit !
let ’ s go in together , and still keeping your silence , i beg you .
the time is so out of whack .
o cursed spite , that ever i was born to set it right !
no , come , let 's go together .
give him this money and these notes , propn .
i will , my lord .
you would do very well , good propn , before you visit him , to ask someone about his behavior .
my lord , i did intend to ask .
by propn , well said , very well said .
look here , sir , propn ask what danes are in propn , and how , and who , what means , and where they live , what company , at what expense , and finding , by this talking around and drift of questions , that they who do know my son , come nearer to you than your particular questions will touch it .
assume , as it were , that you have only heard about him , such as , “ i know his father and his friends , and in part him ” , are you listening to me , propn ?
yes , very well , my lord .
and in part him , but , ” you may say , “ not very well .
as gaming , my lord .
yes , or drinking , fencing , swearing , quarrelling , propn .
you may go that far .
my lord , that would dishonor him .
just as you mention it in the charge .
you must not put another scandal on him , that he is open to inconstancy .
just tell his faults so quaintly that they may seem to be the stains of freedom , the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind , a savageness in wild blood , an attack that everyone goes through .
but , my good lord , why should you do this ?
yes , my lord , i want to know that .
by propn , sir , here 's my intention : , and i believe it is a trick of protection .
and then , sir , ask if he does this , does he -- what was i about to say ?
so , using my lecture and advice from before , you shall check on my son .
you understand me , yes ?
my lord , i do .
my good lord !
observe his inclinations in yourself .
i shall , my lord .
and let him practice his music .
well , my lord .
goodbye !
alas , my lord , i have been so frightened !
by what , in the name of propn ?
my lord , as i was sewing in my chamber , propn propn , with his shirt all unbuttoned , no hat upon his head , his stockings dirty , not pulled up , and fallen down around his ankles , propn as his shirt , his knees knocking together , and with a look so pitiful in its meaning as if he had been freed out of hell to speak of horrors , he comes before me .
propn for your love ?
my lord , i do n ’ t know , but i truly fear it .
what did he say ?
he took me by the wrist , and held me hard , then he went to the length of his whole arm , and with his other hand like this over his brow , he started such study of my face as though he wanted to draw it .
come , go with me .
i will look for the king .
this is the very passion of love whose violent property kills itself , and leads the will to desperate undertakings as often as any passion under propn that afflicts our natures .
no , my good lord , but , as you did command , i did reject his letters and denied his access to me .
that has made him crazy .
i am sorry that i did n ’ t treat him with better heed and propn .
i was afraid he was only trifling with you and meant to wreck you , but curse my jealousy !
it seems it is as proper for our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion .
come , let ’ s go to the king .
this must be known , which , if kept secret , might mean more trouble to hide it than hate for utter love .
welcome , dear propn and propn !
in addition to the fact that we have wanted to see you for a long time , the reason we need to see you made us send our hasty invitation .
what the problem should be , more than his father 's death that has put him so much from the understanding of himself , i can not dream of .
i beg you both that , being childhood friends and brought up with him , and since you know well his youth and disposition , that you will be pleased to rest here in our court for a while , so that , with your company , you draw him on to enjoy himself , and to gather , so much as from any occasion you may glean , whether anything , unknown to us , afflicts him like this , that , once we know , we can make better .
good gentlemen , he has much talked of you , and i am sure that there are not living two men with whom he feels close .
if you will please show us so much gentry and goodwill as to spend your time with us a while , to help us find out what is troubling him , your visit shall receive such thanks as only a king can give .
both your majesties propn , by the sovereign power you have of us , put your huge request more into a command than to an entreaty .
we both obey , and here we give up ourselves , without reservation , to lay our service freely at your feet , to be commanded .
thanks , propn and gentle propn .
thanks , guildenstern and gentle propn .
and i beg you instantly to visit my too much changed son .
go , some of you , and bring these gentlemen where propn is .
may the heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him !
yes , amen !
the ambassadors from propn , my good lord , are joyfully returned .
you have always been the father of good news .
have i , my lord ?
i assure you , my good lord , i believe my duty is , as i believe in my soul , both to my propn and to my gracious king .
and i do think— or else this brain of mine does n ’ t know the trail of policy as surely as it used to do— , that i have found the very cause of propn 's lunacy .
introduce yourself to them , and bring them in .
he tells me , my sweet queen , he has found the head and source of all your son 's unhappiness .
i doubt it is none other than the main reason , his father 's death and our overly hasty marriage .
well , we shall figure him out .
welcome , my good friends !
say , propn , what news from our ally , propn ?
we really like this news , and later when we have more time we 'll read this request , answer , and think upon this business .
in the meantime , we thank you for a job well done .
get some rest , tonight we 'll feast together .
a great welcome home !
this business is well ended .
propn ” i call it , because to define true craziness , what is it except to be nothing else but crazy ?
but ignore that .
propn , i swear i use no clever words at all .
it remains like this , and the remainder like this .
consider .
i have a daughter , have while she is mine , who , in her duty and obedience , listen , has given me this .
now listen and understand .
you may doubt you that the stars are fire , ” you may doubt that the sun does move , ” you may doubt truth to be a liar , ” but never doubt i love .
o dear propn , i am sick at the number of my sighs , i do n ’ t have the skill to calculate my groans .
but that i love you best , o most best , believe it .
propn .
yours evermore , most dear lady , while this brain is in him , propn .
this my daughter has shown this to me in obedience , and furthermore , has his gifts , which she has described to me by the time , by means , and place they were received .
but how has she received his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a man faithful and honorable .
i would gladly prove so .
do you think it is this ?
it may be , very likely .
has there been such a time , i ’ d gladly know that , that i have positively said “ it is so , ” and it was n ’ t ?
not that i know of .
take this from this , if this is n ’ t the case now .
if get the opportunity , i will find where truth is hidden , though it were hidden indeed within the centre of the man .
how can we find out more ?
you know sometimes he walks for hours and hours here in the lobby .
so he does indeed .
at such a time , i ’ ll make sure my daughter meets him .
you and i will be behind a curtain then , listening to their encounter .
if he does n ’ t love her , and he ’ s not gone crazy because of love , let me be no assistant for a state , but be a farmer and horse carter .
we will try it .
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading .
o , give me permission .
how does my good propn propn ?
well , propn have mercy .
do you know me , my lord ?
not i , my lord .
then i wish you were so honest a man .
honest , my lord !
that 's very true , my lord .
for if the sun breeds maggots in a dead dog , being a god - kissing rotten flesh— have you a daughter ?
i have , my lord .
let her not walk in the sun .
pregnancy is a blessing , but not as your daughter may get pregnant .
friend , look to it .
how say you by that ?
still harping on my daughter .
he is far gone , far gone !
in my youth i truly suffered much agony for love almost like this .
words , words , words .
what is the matter , my lord ?
between who ?
i mean , the matter that you are reading , my lord .
all of which , sir , although i believe it most powerfully and potently , yet i think it was dishonest to have written it like this , because you yourself , sir , should be old as i am , if , like a crab , you could go backward .
into my grave ?
indeed , that is out of the air .
aside .
how full of meaning his replies sometimes are !
a happiness that often craziness hits on , which reason and sanity could n ’ t arranged so happily .
you can not , sir , take from me anything that i will more willingly part with , except my life , except my life , except my life .
goodbye , my lord .
these tedious old fools !
propn save you , sir !
my honored lord !
my most dear lord !
my excellent good friends !
how are you , guildenstern ?
ah , propn !
good lads , how do you both ?
as the indifferent children of the earth .
nor the soles of her shoe ?
neither , my lord .
then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
propn , we are her privates .
in the secret parts of fortune ?
what 's the news ?
none , my lord , but that the world 's grown honest .
prison , my lord !
propn 's a prison .
then the world is one .
a goodly one , in which there are many cells , wards , and dungeons , propn being one of the worst .
we do n ’ t think so , my lord .
why , then it is not a prison to you , for there is nothing either good or bad but only thinking makes it so .
to me , it is a prison .
o propn , i could be put into a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space , if it were not that i have bad dreams .
those dreams are indeed ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
a dream itself is but a shadow .
truly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow 's shadow .
then our beggars are bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes are the beggars ' shadows .
shall we to the court ?
for , by my faith , i can not reason .
we 'll wait upon you .
that ’ s not necessary .
i wo n ’ t sort you with the rest of my servants , because , to speak to you like an honest man , i am most dreadfully attended .
but , in the beaten way of friendship , what are you doing at propn ?
to visit you , my lord , no other occasion .
beggar that i am , i am even poor in thanks , but i thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are a halfpenny too expensive .
were n ’ t you sent for ?
is it your own desire to come here ?
is it a free visit ?
come on , tell me the truth .
what should we say , my lord ?
why , anything but to the answer .
you were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks , which you are not very good at hiding .
i know the good king and queen have sent for you .
what for , my lord ?
you have to tell me .
but let me beg you , by the rights of our fellowship , by the harmony of our youth , by the obligation of our ever preserved love , and by anything else that could charge you to be even and direct with me , were you were sent for or not ?
what do you say ?
my lord , we were sent for .
i have of late , but why i do n ’ t know , lost all my joy , given up all habits of exercises , and indeed , i am so depressed that this good frame , the earth , seems to me to be a sterile outpost , this most excellent canopy , the air— look— , this brave sky hanging over us , this majestic roof divided with golden fire , why , it seems to me to be nothing but a dirty and disgusting meeting of vapors .
what a piece of work is man !
how noble in reason !
how infinite in faculties !
in form and moving , how expressive and admirable !
in action how like an angel !
in understanding , how like a god !
and yet , to me , what is this highly refined speck of dust ?
man does n ’ t delight me , no , nor woman either , though by your smiling , you seem to find that funny .
my lord , there was n ’ t any such stuff in my thoughts .
why did you laugh then , when i said , “ man does n ’ t delight me ” ?
to think , my lord , if you do not delight in man , what a somber reception the players shall receive from you .
we passed them on the way , and they are coming here to perform .
what players are they ?
even those you usually enjoy , the tragedians of the city .
how is it that they travel ?
being in the city was better for them in regards to their reputation and their profits .
i think their traveling to perform a play is a new innovation .
do they hold the same respect they did when i was in the city ?
are they still followed ?
no , indeed , they are not .
why ?
do they grow rusty ?
no , their work keeps them at their usual pace , but there is , sir , a brood of children , untrained , that complicate their situation , and are most tyrannically beaten for it .
children are now very popular , and are on the common stages , as they call them , so much that many actors are afraid they can not compete and barely dare to come there .
what , are they children ?
who cares for them ?
where do they live ?
will they stop pursuing the stage when they can no longer sing ?
wo n ’ t they say later , if they should go on to become common players , which is likely , and their lives are no better , that their writers did them wrong to make them exclaim against their own success ?
well , there has been a lot of comment on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to provoke them to controversy .
there was , for a while , no money paid for debate unless the poet and the player fought over the question .
is it possible ?
o , there has been a lot of bashing of brains going on .
do the boys carry them away ?
yes , they do , my lord , propn and his load too .
it is not very strange , for my uncle is king of propn , and those that would make faces at him while my father lived , paid twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats each for a little picture of him .
propn ’ s blood ! , there is something more than natural in this , if philosophy could figure it out .
there are the players .
gentlemen , you are welcome to propn .
let me shake your hands .
the accessory of a welcome is fashion and ceremony .
let me comply with it in these clothes , for fear that my welcome to the players , which i tell you must look good , should more appear like entertainment than your plays .
you are welcome .
but my uncle - father and aunt- mother are deceived .
in what , my dear lord ?
i am but crazy north - north - west .
when the wind is from the south , i know a hawk from a handsaw .
welcome , gentlemen !
listen , guildenstern , and you too , with each ear .
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clothes .
happily this is the second time he uses them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
i predict he comes to tell me of the players , listen .
you say right , sir .
on propn morning , it was true indeed .
buzz , buzz !
seneca can not be too heavy nor propn too light .
for the law of writ and the liberty , these are the only men .
o propn , judge of propn , what a treasure you had !
what treasure did he have , my lord ?
why , “ one fair daughter , and no more , the which he loved passing well . ” still harping on my daughter .
am i not in the right , old propn ?
if you call me propn , my lord , i have a daughter that i love passing well .
no , that does n ’ t follow .
what follows , then , my lord ?
why , “ as by lot , propn knows , ” and then , you know , ” it came to pass , as most like it was . ” the first line of the holy song will show you more , for look where my means of whiling away the time comes .
you are welcome , masters , welcome , all .
i am glad to see you well .
welcome , good friends .
what , my young lady and mistress !
by our lady , your ladyship is taller than when i saw you last , by the height of a high - heeled shoe .
pray propn , your voice , like a an unused gold coin , ca n ’ t be cracked within the ring .
masters , you are all welcome .
we 'll act up like french falconers : fly at anything we see .
we 'll have a speech right now .
come , give us a bit of your quality .
come , a passionate speech .
what speech , my lord ?
i heard you do a speech once , but it was never acted , or if it was , not more than once , for the play , i remember , did n ’ t please the crowd , it was caviar to the particular , but it was , as i took it , and others , whose judgments in such matters far exceed mine , an excellent play , well organized in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as skill .
i remember , one said there were no mixes in the lines to make the matter spicy , and no matter in the phrase that might accuse the author of putting on airs , but called it an honest effort , as wholesome as it was sweet , and , by very much , more handsome than fine .
if you can remember it , begin at this line , let me see , let me see .
by propn , my lord , well spoken , with good accent and good judgment .
eventually he finds him , striking too short at the propn .
his old sword , rebelling against his arm , lies where it falls , resisting his commands .
not matched equally , propn lunges at propn , strikes wild in rage , but , with the whiff and wind of his fierce sword , the shaken father falls .
then senseless propn , seeming to feel this blow , flaming at his top stoops to his base , and , with a hideous crash , cuts off prisoner propn ' ear .
behold !
his sword , which was declining on the milky head of reverend propn , seemed in the air to stick .
so , like a painted tyrant , propn stood , and , as if not giving in to his will and body , did nothing .
but , as we often see a silence in the heavens , after some storm , the gales stand still , the bold winds speechless , and the earth below propn hushed as death , and eventually the dreadful thunder tears the region , so , after propn ' pause , a roused anger renews him and he begins to work , and never did the one - eyed monster ’ s hammers fall on the god of war ’ s amour , forged for eternal strength , with less sorrow than propn ' bleeding sword now falls on propn .
out , out , you loose woman , propn !
all you gods , in general meeting , take away her power , break all the spokes and curved rims from her wheel , and bowl the hub of the wheel down the hill of propn , as low as you can to kill the fiends !
this is too long .
it shall go to the barber 's , to be cut with your beard .
i beg you , continue .
he 's for a jig or a dirty tale , or he sleeps .
continue , come to propn .
wrapped up queen ” is good .
run barefoot up and down , threatening the flames with blind tears , a cloth on that head where lately the crown had stood , and for a robe , about her thin loins , exhausted from child - bearing , a blanket , caught up in the panic of fear , whoever had seen this , with a very poisoned tongue , would have pronounced treason against propn 's state .
but if the gods themselves saw her then , when she saw propn make malicious sport by chopping her husband ’ s limbs with his sword , the instant burst of noise that she made , unless mortal events ca n ’ t move them at all , would have made the burning eyes of propn milk , and rouse passion in the gods .
look , where he has turned pale , and has tears in his eyes .
i beg you , no more !
it is well .
i ’ ll have you speak out the rest of this soon .
my good lord , will you see the players well taken care of ?
do you hear me ?
let them be well used , for they are the short stories and brief history of the time .
after you die , it would be better to have a bad epitaph then than their ill report while you live now .
my lord , i will use them according to their class .
propn ’ s bodkin , man , better .
use every man according to his class , and who should escape whipping ?
use them according to your class .
the less they deserve it , the more credit it is to you .
take them in .
come , sirs .
follow him , friends .
we 'll hear a play tomorrow .
do you hear me , old friend ?
we 'll have it tomorrow night .
yes , my lord .
very well .
follow that lord , and see you do n ’ t mock him .
i ’ ll leave you till night .
you are welcome to propn .
my good lord !
yes , so , propn be with you !
now i am alone .
o , what a idle , wandering , and peasant slave i am !
is n ’ t it monstrous that this actor here , only in a play , in a dream of passion , could force his soul so to his own actions that his grew pale from the words of the speech , tears in his eyes , separation from reality in his face , a broken voice , and his whole function matching forms to his role ?
and all for nothing !
for propn ?
what 's propn to him , or he to propn , that he should weep for her ?
what would he do if he had the motive and the cue for passion that i have ?
he would drown the stage with tears and split the audience ’ s with horrid speech , make the guilty crazy , and shock the innocent , propn the ignorant , and amaze , indeed , the very faculties of eyes and ears .
am i a coward ?
who calls me villain ?
breaks my head across ?
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
tweaks me by the nose ?
lies about me in the throat as deep as the lungs ?
bloody , bawdy villain !
remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
o , vengeance !
why , what an ass i am !
this is most brave , that i , the son of a dear father murdered , prompted to my revenge by propn and hell , must , like a whore , release the content of my heart with words , and fall down cursing like a very drab , propn servant in the kitchen !
shame on it !
argh !
change course , my brain !
i have heard that guilty creatures , sitting at a play , have been so struck to the soul by the very cunning of the scene that presently they have confessed their evil deeds , because murder , although it is silent , will speak with its own most miraculous organ , i ’ ll have these propn play something like the murder of my father before my uncle .
i ’ ll observe his looks , i ’ ll watch his every move .
even if he only winks , i know what i have to do .
i ’ ll need to have more proof than this .
the play 's the thing wherein i ’ ll see the conscience of the king .
and ca n ’ t you , by any circumstance , get from him why he puts on this craziness , grating all his days of quiet so harshly with turbulence and dangerous lunacy ?
he does confess that he feels himself troubled , but he will by no means speak about the cause .
nor do we find him easy to figure out the reason why , because , with a crafty craziness , keeps his distance when we try to bring him to some confession of his true state .
did he receive you well ?
most like a gentleman .
but with much forcing to make himself do it .
difficult to question , but , when we ask for something , he is most free in his reply .
did you try to get him to engage in any pastime ?
propn , it just so happened that certain players we passed on the way here .
we told him about them , and it seemed to make him happy to hear of it .
they are here at the court , and , i think , they are already hired to play before him tonight .
this is very true , and he begged me to invite your majesties to hear and see the play .
with all my heart , and it makes me happy to hear that he is so inclined .
good gentlemen , cut him some slack , and keep his attentions on these delights .
we shall , my lord .
propn propn , leave us too , for we have secretly sent for propn to come here , that here he may , as if by accident propn propn .
her father and i , lawful spies , will so hide ourselves that , seeing but unseen , we may honestly judge their encounter , and gather from him , or how he behaves , if it ’ s the affliction of his love or not that he suffers like this for .
i really hope your virtues will bring him to his usual way again , to the honor of both of you .
propn , i wish it may .
propn , you walk here .
gracious king , if it pleases you , we will bestow ourselves .
read this book , showing that such an exercise may colours your loneliness .
we are often to blame in this , it ’ s been proven often , that with devotion 's face and holy actions , we sugar over the propn himself .
o , it is too true !
how hurting a lash that speech gives my conscience !
the prostitute 's cheek , covered with makeup , is n ’ t more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my very artificial words .
o heavy burden !
i hear him coming .
let 's hide , my lord .
there 's the respect that makes a mess of long life , for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's insults , the pangs of rejected love , the law 's delay , the inexperience of office , and the disdain that patient merit takes from the unworthy , when he himself might his final settlement make with a bare , sharp knife ?
who would bear these burdens to grunt and sweat under a weary life , except that the dread of something after death , the undiscovered country , from whose borders no traveler returns , puzzles the mind , and makes us bear those problems we have rather than fly to others that we do n ’ t know about ?
in this way , a conscience can make cowards of us all , and in this way the natural color of making up your mind is covered with the pale shadow of thinking , and projects of great substance and significance , and in this regard , their movement turns erratic , and lose the name of action .
wait !
the fair propn !
propn , in your eyes may all my sins be remembered .
my good lord , how has your honor been for this many a day ?
i humbly thank you , well , well , well .
my lord , i have mementos of yours that i have longed to re - deliver to you for a long time .
i beg you , take them back now .
my honored lord , you know right well you did , and with them , words composed of so sweet an air as made the things more rich .
their sweet air being gone , take them back again , because to the noble mind propn gifts grow poor when the givers prove unkind .
there , my lord .
are you sincere ?
my lord ?
are you truthful ?
what do you mean ?
that if you be sincere and truthful , your sincerity should n ’ t have any talks to your beauty .
could beauty , my lord , have better dealings than with sincerity ?
yes , truly , for the power of beauty will transform sincerity from what it is to a pimp faster than the force of sincerity can translate beauty into his image .
this used to be contradictory , but now the time proves it ’ s true .
i did love you once .
indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
you should not have believed me , for virtue ca n ’ t graft a new plant onto our old stock but we shall relish of it .
i did n ’ t love you .
i was deceived all the more .
get yourself to a convent .
why would you give birth to sinners ?
i do n ’ t care about my sincerity , but i could accuse myself of such things that it were better my mother had not had me .
i am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offenses at my command than i have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to commit them in .
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and propn ?
we are wicked men , all , believe none of us .
take yourself a convent .
where 's your father ?
at home , my lord .
shut the doors on him , that he may play the fool nowhere else but in his own house .
goodbye .
o , help him , you sweet heavens !
if you do , by propn , i ’ ll give you this curse for your wedding gift : whether you as chaste as ice , as pure as snow , you shalt not escape slander .
go to a convent , go .
goodbye .
or , if you will marry , make it a fool , by propn , for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them .
to a convent , go , and quickly too .
goodbye .
o heavenly powers , restore him !
you dance , you walk , and you whisper and nickname animals , and make your looseness your ignorance .
i say , we will have no more marriages .
those that are married already , all but one , shall live , the rest stay the same .
to a convent , go .
o , what a noble mind here is conquered !
the courtier 's , scholar 's , soldier 's , eye , voice , sword , the hope and flower of propn , the mirror of fashion and the mold of perfect form , the observed of all observers , quite , quite taken down !
and i of all ladies most dejected and wretched that has tasted the honey of his musical vows , now see that noble and most royal mind , like sweet bells jangling , out of tune and harsh to hear , that form and feature of blown youth without equal totally crazy .
o , woe is me , to have seen the man i have seen , see the man i see !
love !
his affections do n ’ t go that way , and what he said , though it was a little unorganized , was n ’ t like craziness .
there 's something in his soul over which his depression sits like a bird on an egg , and i doubt that egg will hatch and the “ bird ” will be something dangerous , which to prevent , i have quickly decided to write it down like this .
happily the seas , and different countries with other things , shall cure and get rid of this problem in his heart that has such a hold on him , which his still active brain makes him like this from being himself .
what do you think about it ?
it ’ ll be ok .
but i still believe the source and beginning of his grief began with rejected love .
how are you , propn !
my lord , do as you please , but if you think it ’ s ok , after the play , let his queen mother talk to him all alone and beg him to share his problem .
let her be strict with him , and i ’ ll be hide , if it pleases you , so i can hear of all their conference .
if she ca n ’ t find out what ’ s wrong , then send him to propn , or lock him up where you think is the best place .
that ’ s what i ’ ll do .
craziness in great ones must not go unwatched .
speak the part , i beg you , as i read it to you , lightly on your tongue .
but if you just repeat it , as many actors do , i would prefer the town crier spoke my lines .
o , it offends me to the soul to hear a hefty fellow with a wig tear an emotion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the cheap seats , who , for the most part , are capable of nothing but confusing pantomime and noise .
please avoid it .
i assure you .
but do n ’ t be too tame either , but let your own discretion be your teacher .
fit the action to the word , the word to the action , with this special rule , that you do n ’ t overstep the simplicity of being natural , for anything so overdone is not the purpose of playing , whose end , both at the first and now , was and is , to hold , as it were , the mirror up to nature , to show truth in reality , scorn her falseness , and his form and force to the very age and body of the time .
now , this overacting , or lateness , though it make the ignorant laugh , can only make the experienced grieve , in whose opinion , you must outdo a whole theatre of other audiences in your performance .
o , there are actors that i have seen perform and heard others praise , and highly too , not to speak too harshly , that , having neither the accent of propn , nor the walk of a propn , a pagan , or a man , have so strutted and yelled that i have thought some of nature 's hired help had made them and not made them well , they imitated mankind so dreadfully .
i hope we have calmly overcome those problems , sir .
o , overcome them with zeal .
that 's horrible and shows very bad manners in the fool that uses it .
go get ready .
how are you , my lord !
will the king hear this piece of work ?
and the queen too , and they should be here presently .
we will , my lord .
what , here , propn !
here , sweet lord , at your service .
propn , you are just like the man that my conversation just now praised .
why should the poor be flattered ?
no , let the sweet tongue lick ridiculous vain glory , and bend the obvious hinges of the knee where poverty may follow flattery .
do you hear me ?
since my dear soul controlled her choice , and could recognize men of truth , her choice has taken you for herself .
because you have been as one , that in suffering all , that suffers nothing , a man that propn 's feasts and rewards have taken with equal thanks , and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well blended that they are not an instrument for propn 's finger to play whatever song she pleases .
give me that man that is not passion 's slave , and i will wear him in my heart 's core , yes , in my heart of heart , as i do you .
ok , enough of that .
there is a play tonight before the king .
one scene of it comes near the circumstances , which i have told you , of my father 's death .
i beg you , when you see that act begin , even with the very criticism of your soul watch my uncle .
if his hidden guilt do n ’ t show itself in that one speech , it is a false ghost that we have seen , and my imaginations are as unstable as god of fire ’ s anvil .
watch him carefully , because i will have my eyes riveted on his face , and , after the play , we will combine our observations in condemning of his actions .
well , my lord .
if he steals anything the while this play is going on , and he escapes detection , i will pay for the theft .
they are coming to the play .
i must be idle .
go get yourself a seat .
how ’ s our cousin propn ?
excellent , really , of the chameleon 's dish .
i eat the air , crammed with promises .
you ca n ’ t eat capons that way .
no , for me now .
my lord , you acted once when you were in the university , you say ?
that did i , my lord , and i was accounted a good actor .
what did you enact ?
i did enact propn propn , i was killed in the propn , propn killed me .
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a stupid fellow there .
are the players ready ?
come hear , my dear propn , sit by me .
o , ho !
do you see that ?
propn , shall i lie in your lap ?
no , my lord .
i mean , lay my head on your lap ?
yes , my lord .
do you think i meant sexual matters ?
i think nothing , my lord .
that 's a fair thought to lie between maids ' legs .
what is , my lord ?
nothing .
you are merry , my lord .
who , me ?
yes , my lord .
o , your only dancer !
what should a man do but be merry ?
because look how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
no , it is four months , my lord .
so long ?
no then , let the devil wear black , for i ’ ll have a suit of black fur .
o heavens !
died two months ago and not forgotten yet ?
by propn , this is miching mallecho , it means mischief .
it ’ s as if this show describes the argument of the play .
we shall know by this fellow .
the players can not keep a secret , they 'll tell all .
will he tell us what this show meant ?
yes , or any show that you 'll show him .
if you are not ashamed to show , he wo n ’ t be ashamed to tell you what it means .
keep quiet , keep quiet .
i ’ ll watch the play .
for us and for our tragedy , here stooping to your clemency , we beg you listen patiently .
is this a prologue or a ring of flowers ?
it is short , my lord .
as woman 's love .
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us count again before love is finished !
that i do n ’ t trust you .
now , you know how i love you has been proven to you , and as my love is can not be measured , so is my fear .
where love is great , the littlest doubts are very fearful , where little fears grow great , great love also grows there .
such love must be treason in my breast .
let me be cursed if i marry again !
no one marries the second without killing the first love .
the reasons for a second marriage are low respects of saving money , but not for love .
i kill my husband dead a second time when second husband kisses me in bed .
i believe you believe what you say now , but what we determine to , often we do n ’ t .
promises are only good when you remember them , born of violence but poor truth , which now , like unripe fruit , stays on the tree , but fall without shaking them off when they are ripe .
it is very necessary that we forget to pay ourselves what we owe to ourselves .
what we promise ourselves in a fit of passion , when the passion ends , so does the promise .
the violence of either grief or joy destroys their own keeping of them with themselves .
where joy celebrates , grief mourns greatly , propn joys , joy griefs , on a very slender event .
this world does n ’ t say yes , and it ’ s not strange at all that even our loves should change with our fortunes , because it ’ s a question we have to prove , when love leads fortune , or if fortune leads love .
but , to go back to where i started , our wills and fates run in so much in different directions , that our plans are still turned upside down , our thoughts are ours , but their results are n ’ t ours .
so you think you wo n ’ t marry again , but you ’ ll change your mind when your first lord is dead .
if she should break the moment now !
it is a very deep oath .
sleep rock your brain , and may misfortune never mischance between us two !
propn , how like you this play ?
the lady protests too much , i think .
o , but she 'll keep her word .
have you heard the story ?
it ’ s not offensive , is it ?
no , no !
they only pretend , pretend to poison , no offense in the world .
what ’ s the name of the play ?
the propn .
by propn , how ?
a metaphor .
this play is the image of a murder done in propn .
but what o ' that ?
your majesty , and we that have free souls ca n ’ t be touched by it .
let the bitter hussy kick , our saddles do n ’ t pinch .
this is one propn , nephew to the propn .
you are a good chorus , my lord .
i could translate between you and your love , if i could see the toys flirting .
you are forward , my lord , you are forward .
it would cost you a night in bed to take the edge off me .
even better , and worse .
and that ’ s how you must take your husbands .
begin , murderer , argh !
enough with the bad faces , and begin .
he poisons him in the garden for his estate .
his name 's gonzago .
the propn rises .
what , frightened by false fire !
how are you , my lord ?
stop the play .
give me some light .
let ’ s go !
propn , lights , lights !
would n ’ t this do it , sir , together with a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn against with me , with two provincial roses on my shoes i took off , to get me a fellowship for writing with a pack of players , sir ?
half a share .
you might have rhymed those lines .
o good propn , i ’ ll take the ghost 's word for as real as a thousand dollars !
did you see ?
very well , my lord .
when the talk was about the poisoning ?
i watched him very well .
ah , ha !
come , some music !
come , some music !
my good my lord , may i a word with you .
propn , i ’ ll give you a whole history .
the king , sir yes , sir , what about him ?
he ’ s , in his retirement to bed , exceedingly upset .
with drink , sir ?
no , my lord , rather with anger .
you ’ d be wiser and look better if you told all this to the doctor , because for me to try to purge him of anger would probably make him more angry .
my good lord , please re - phrase what you ’ re saying , and do n ’ t give me answers so far away from my question .
i am calm , sir .
ask away .
the queen , your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , has sent me to you .
you are welcome .
no , good my lord , this courtesy is not the right answer .
propn , i can not .
what , my lord ?
but , sir , such answer as i can make , you shall command , or rather , as you say , my mother shall command .
ok , i ’ ll say no more but to the problem .
o wonderful son , that can so astonish a mother !
but is n ’ t there a sequel that follows this mother 's surprise ?
she wants to speak with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
we shall obey , if she were ten times our mother .
have you any else to tell me ?
my lord , you loved me once .
and i still do , by these thieves and robbers .
my good lord , what is your cause of your problem ?
you certainly bar the door to your own freedom if you do n ’ t tell your problems to your friend .
propn , i do n ’ t have a promotion .
how can that be , when the king himself says you will succeed him to the throne in propn ?
yes , sir , but “ while the grass grows ” — the proverb is a bit old - fashioned .
o , the pipes .
let me see one .
to divert your attention , why do you go about trying to figure me out , as if you ’ re to pick a fight ?
o my lord , if my duty is too bold , it ’ s because my love has no manners .
i do n ’ t understand that at all .
will you play on this pipe ?
my lord , i ca n ’ t .
i beg you .
believe me , i ca n ’ t .
i ’ m begging you .
i do n ’ t know how to play it , my lord .
it ’ s as easy as lying .
just close up these holes with your finger and thumb , put it in your mouth and blow , and it will yield the most eloquent music .
look you , these are the holes to cover .
why , look here , at what an unworthy a thing you make of me !
you would play me , you would seem to know my holes to cover , you want to pick out the heart of my mystery , you would sound me from my lowest note to the my highest note , and there is much music , excellent voice , in this little pipe , yet you ca n ’ t play it .
do you think it is easier to play me than a pipe ?
call me whatever instrument you want to , although you can try to cover my holes me , you ca n ’ t play me .
propn bless you , sir !
my lord , the queen wants to speak with you right now .
do you see that cloud over there that 's almost in shape of a camel ?
by the mass , it is indeed like a camel .
i think it is like a weasel .
it is shaped like a weasel .
or like a whale .
very like a whale .
then i will go to my mother by and by .
i will say so .
by - and - by is easily said .
leave me , friends .
now , it ’ s the very witching time of night , when churchyards awake , and hell itself breathes out propn to this world .
now i could drink hot blood , and do such wicked deed that the day would shake nervously to see .
listen !
now to my mother .
o heart , do n ’ t give up now , do n ’ t ever let the soul of propn , the crazy emperor , enter this determined heart .
i do n ’ t like him , and it does n ’ t seem to be safe to us to let his craziness run free .
the terms of our estate may not endure with danger so near to us as his craziness seems to get worse by the hour .
we will get ourselves ready .
it ’ s a most holy and religious fear to keep those many , many bodies safe that depend upon your majesty .
the single and peculiar life is bound , with all the strength and amour of the mind , to keep itself from madness , but much more so for that spirit on whose government the lives of many propn and rest .
the government of a propn propn with him , but draws what 's near it with it , like a gulf .
it is a massive wheel , set at the top of the highest mountain , in which its huge spokes , ten thousand little things are firmly glued together , that , when the wheel falls , each small piece , insignificant event , adds to the noisy ruin of the country .
the propn never sighed by himself , but with the whole country ’ s groan .
get started , i beg you , on this speedy voyage , for we will control this fear , which now goes about too freely .
we will go quickly .
my lord , he 's going to his mother 's bedroom .
i ’ ll hide myself behind the curtain so i can hear what happens , i ’ ll guarantee she 'll set him straight .
and , as you said , and wisely it was said , it is proper that some beside his mother , since nature makes them subjective , should overhear the speech objectively .
goodbye , my lord .
i ’ ll call on you before you go to bed , and tell you what i know .
thanks , my dear lord .
what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with my brother 's blood , is n ’ t there enough rain in the sweet heavens to wash it as white as snow ?
what use is mercy except to confront the face of offense ?
and what 's in prayer except this double force , to be prevented from falling down , or pardoned since we are down ?
then i ’ ll look up , my sin is committed .
but , o , what form of prayer can help me ?
forgive me of my foul murder !
that ca n ’ t be it , since i still have all those things for which i did the murder , my crown , my own ambition , and my queen .
may one be forgiven a sin and still hold on to its benefits ?
what then ?
what stops ?
i ’ ll see what being sorry does .
what ca n ’ t it do ?
o heart as black as death !
o dissolving soul , that , struggling to be free , is more a slave !
help , angels !
make an attempt .
propn , stubborn knees , and , heart , with strings of steel , be soft as the muscles of the newborn baby !
all may be well .
i must think about that .
a villain kills my father , and for that , i , his sole son , do this same villain send to propn .
o , this is a contract and pay , not revenge .
he took my father grossly , full of food , with all his sins on his soul , as full of bloom as propn , and how his report stands , who knows except propn ?
no .
up , sword , and know a more horrid intention .
when he is asleep drunk , or in his rage , or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed , at gaming , swearing , or committing some act that has no element of salvation in it , then attack him , so that his heels may kick at propn , and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell , where it goes to .
my mother is waiting .
this relief only makes your sickly days longer .
my words go up , my thoughts stay here below .
words without thoughts never go to propn .
he will come right away .
see that you are direct with him .
tell him his pranks have been too excessive to put up with , and that your grace has taken a lot of heat because of him .
i ’ ll hide here silently .
i beg you , be firm with him .
hide , i hear him coming .
now , mother , what 's the matter ?
propn , you have offended your father very much .
mother , you have offended my father very much .
come , come , you answer me stupidly .
go , go , you answer me with wickedness .
why , how can you , propn !
what 's the matter now ?
have you forgotten i ’ m your mother ?
no , by the church , i have n ’ t .
you are the propn , your husband 's brother 's wife , and , i wish it was n ’ t so , but you are my mother .
no , then , i ’ ll send those to you who can speak .
what will you do ?
you wilt not murder me ?
help , help , ho !
what , ho !
help , help , help !
draws .
o , i am slain !
o me , what have you done ?
no , i do n ’ t know .
is it the king ?
o , what a thoughtless and bloody deed this is !
a bloody deed !
almost as bad , good mother , as killing a king and marrying his brother .
as killing a king !
yes , lady , that ’ s what i said .
you wretched , rash , intruding fool , goodbye !
i mistook you for the propn .
leave wringing of your hands .
quiet !
what have i done , that you dare scream at me so loudly and rudely ?
propn 's face glows— yes , this solid and compound body with a trustful face— as against the end of the world , is sickened by the thought of the act .
ah me , what act propn so loudly and thunders in the wind ?
look here upon this picture and on this one , the representation of two brothers .
here is your husband , like a mildewed ear of corn poisoning his wholesome brother .
have you got eyes ?
could you feed on this fair mountain , and glut yourself on this swamp ?
huh ?
have you got eyes ?
what devil was it that trick you like this with a blindfold ?
eyes without feeling , feeling without sight , ears without hands or eyes , smelling without them all , or a sickly part of one true sense could n ’ t act like this without a conscious thought .
o shame !
are n ’ t you embarrassed ?
rebellious hell , if you can rebel in an old lady ’ s bones , then let virtue be like wax to burning youth , and melt in her own fire .
proclaim no shame when the compulsive passion takes charge , since frost itself burns as well , and reason pimps the will .
o propn , do n ’ t say anything else .
you turn my eyes into my very soul , and there i see such black and grainy spots as will not leave their color .
no , but to live in the rotten sweat of an greasy bed , stewed in corruption , using sweet words and making love over the nasty pig sty .
no more .
a king of shreds and patches !
save me and hover over me with your wings , you heavenly guards !
what does you gracious figure want ?
alas , he 's crazy !
do n ’ t you come to scold your tardy son , that , forgetting time and passion , lets the important acting of your dread command go by ?
o , tell me !
do n ’ t forget .
this visitation is only to sharpen your almost dull purpose .
but , look , amazement sits on your mother ’ s face .
speak to her , propn .
how are you , lady ?
alas , how are you , that you look on empty space , and carry on a conversation with the invisible air ?
your spirits wildly peep from your eyes , and , as the sleeping soldiers at the alarm , your bedded hairs , like life in growths , start up and stand an end .
o gentle son , propn cool patience on the heat and flame of your anger !
where do you look ?
on him , on him !
look how pale he glares !
then what i have to do will need true colours , tears perhaps for blood .
to whom do you speak this ?
do you see nothing there ?
nothing at all , yet all that i see is .
you hear nothing ?
no , nothing but ourselves .
why , look there !
look how it steals away !
my father in his clothes as he lived !
look , where he goes , even now out the door !
this is the very product of your brain .
this bodiless creation is very cunning in imagination .
imagination !
my pulse does temperately keep time like yours , and is just as healthful as yours .
it ’ s not craziness that i have spoken .
test me , and i will re - word the problem , which madness would run away from .
mother , for love of grace , do n ’ t put that flattering oil on your soul that says my craziness speaks and not your sin .
it will only create a scab and film over the ulcer , while rotten corruption , working within everything , infects it unseen .
confess yourself to propn , propn what 's past , avoid what is to come , and do n ’ t spread fertilizer on the weeds , to make them more rotten .
forgive me my truth , because , in the fatness of these wealthy times propn itself must beg pardon of vice , yes , beg and court for permission to do him good .
o propn , you cut my heart in two .
o , throw away the worse part of it , and live the purer life with the other half .
but do n ’ t go to my uncle 's bed , propn as though you have a virtue if you do n ’ t have it .
that monster habit , who eats all sense , of all evil habits is an angel in this , that in order to use fair and good actions , he likewise gives a dress or uniform that is ready to wear .
the next more easy , for use can almost change what is natural , and can either curb the devil or throw him out with wondrous effectiveness .
i am sorry , but propn has decided it to be this way , to punish me with this act , and punish this act with me , that i must be their whip and whip - er .
i will hide him , and will answer the death i gave him well .
so again , goodnight .
one word more , good lady .
what shall i do ?
do n ’ t think it ’ s good to tell him , for who except a queen , fair , sober , wise , would hide from a frog , from a bat , a cat , such dear concerns ?
who would do so ?
no , in spite of sense and secrecy , do n ’ t open the basket on the roof , let the birds fly , and , like the famous ape to test conclusions , do n ’ t creep into the basket and break your own neck .
be assured , if words are made of breath , and breath is made of life , i have no life to breathe what you have said to me .
i must go to propn , you know that ?
propn , i had forgotten .
let it be , because it ’ s the sport to have the swordsman killed with his own sword , and it wo n ’ t be easy but i will dig one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon .
o , it is most sweet , when you can kill two birds with one stone .
mother , goodnight .
indeed , this counselor is now most still , most secret , and most grave , who was a foolish gabby rogue in life .
come , sir , to finish up with you .
good night , mother .
there 's a problem in these sighs .
where is your son ?
leave us alone for a little while .
ah , my good lord , what have i seen tonight !
what , propn ?
how is propn ?
as crazy as the sea and wind , when both fight over which is mightier .
in his wild fit , hearing something stir behind the curtain , he whips out his knife , cries ' a rat , a rat !
and in this headstrong state , kills the hidden good old man .
o heavy deed !
it would ’ ve been us if we had been there .
his freedom is full of threats to everyone , to you yourself , to us , to every one .
alas , how shall this bloody deed be explained ?
it will be our fault , who should ’ ve kept this mad young man on a short leash , restrained , and out of society .
but we loved him so much that we would not understand what was the best action , but , like the owner of a dirty disease , to keep it from showing , let it feed even on the core of life .
where has he gone ?
he weeps for what is done .
o propn , let ’ s go !
propn , guildenstern !
friends both , go get some further assistance .
propn has propn slain in insanity , and he has dragged him from his mother 's bedroom .
go find him , speak gently , and bring the body into the chapel .
i beg you , hurry .
come , propn , we 'll call up our wisest friends , and let them know both what we mean to do and what 's done at an unfortunate time .
so maybe slander , whose whisper covers the entire world as surely as the cannon hits its target and delivers his poisoned shot , may miss our name , and not amount to anything at all .
my soul is full of confusion and sorrow .
safely hidden .
propn !
propn propn !
what ’ s that noise ?
who calls propn ?
here they come .
what have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
mixed it with dust , to which it is related .
tell us where it is , that we may take it from there , and carry it to the chapel .
do n ’ t believe it .
believe what ?
that i can keep your advice , and not my own .
you take me for a sponge , my lord ?
yes , sir , that soaks up the propn 's face , his rewards , his authorities .
but such officers do the king best service in the end .
he keeps them , like an ape , in the corner of his jaw , first to be tasted , and then at last swallowed .
when he needs what you have found out , it is by squeezing you , and , sponge , you shall be dry again .
i do n ’ t understand you , my lord .
i am glad of it .
a clever speech is wasted on a stupid ear .
my lord , you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king .
the body is with the king , but the king is not with the body .
the king is a thing , a thing , my lord !
of nothing .
bring me to him .
hide , fox , and show all later .
i have sent to find him and the body .
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose !
yet we must not put the strong law on him .
he 's very popular with this country ’ s masses , who like not in their minds , but with their eyes , and where it is so , the offender 's punishment is important , but never the offense .
to deal with everything smoothly and evenly , this sudden sending him away must seem like a planned event .
diseases grown desperate are best healed by desperate measures , or not at all .
we can not get from him where the dead body is hidden , my lord .
but where is he ?
outside , my lord , guarded , to know what you want .
bring him before us .
propn , guildenstern !
bring in my lord .
now , propn , where 's propn ?
at supper .
at supper !
where ?
not where he eats , but where he is eaten .
a certain group of educated worms are now biting him .
your worm is your only emperor for diet .
we fatten up all other creatures to fatten us up , when we fatten ourselves for maggots .
your fat king and your lean beggar interchangeable , two dishes but for one table .
that 's the end .
alas , alas !
a man may fish with the worm that has eaten a king , and eat the fish that has fed on that worm .
what do you mean by this ?
nothing but to show you how a king may progress through the guts of a beggar .
where is propn ?
in propn .
send there to see .
if your messenger ca n ’ t find him there , look for him in the other place yourself .
but , indeed , if you do n ’ t find him within this month , you will smell him as you go up the stairs into the lobby .
go find him there .
he will stay until you come .
propn , for this deed , for your special safety , which we do consider as we dearly grieve for what you ’ ve done , we must send you away with fiery quickness .
for propn !
yes , propn .
good .
so it is , if you knew our reasons .
i see an angel that sees them .
but , come , for propn !
goodbye , dear mother .
your loving father , propn .
my mother .
propn and mother is man and wife , man and wife is one flesh , and so , my mother .
come , for propn !
i ’ ll have him away tonight .
away !
because everything is sealed and done that relies on this affair .
i beg you , hurry .
and , propn , if you hold my love at anything , as my great power may give you some sense , since your scar still looks raw and red after the danish sword , and your open fear propn homage to us , you might not view our sovereign process coldly , which gives you full power , by letters testifying to that effect , the present death of propn .
do it , propn , because , he rages like the pace of my blood , and you must cure me .
until i know it is done , however great my luck , my joys can never begin .
go , captain , send my greetings to the danish king .
tell him that , with his permission , propn propn to carry out a promised march over his kingdom .
you know the meeting place .
if his majesty has anything for us to do , we shall express our duty in person , and let him know so .
i will do it , my lord .
go softly on .
good sir , whose armies are these ?
they are from propn , sir .
for what purpose , sir , i beg you ?
against some part of propn .
who commands them , sir ?
the nephew to old propn , propn .
does it go against the main part of propn , sir , or for some frontier ?
to speak honestly , and with no addition to the facts , we go to gain a little patch of ground that ’ s not worth anything except its name .
to pay five dollars , five , i would n ’ t farm it , and it wo n ’ t yield either to propn or the propn a worse rate if it should it be sold in payment .
why , then the propn never will defend it .
yes , it already has garrisons .
two thousand souls and twenty thousand dollars will not settle the question of who owns this worthless land .
this is the abscess of much wealth and peace , that breaks inward , and shows no damage until the man dies .
i humbly thank you , sir .
propn be with you , sir .
will you please go , my lord ?
i ’ ll be with you right away .
walk a little before me .
how every event works against me to spur my dull revenge !
what is a man , if his chief good and use of his time is only to sleep and eat ?
a beast , no more .
surely he that made us with such large capacity , looking before and after , did n ’ t give us that capability and godlike reason to go stale in us , unused .
now , where it is beastly forgetfulness , or some defeated principle of thinking too much on the event , a thought which , cut in quarters , has but one part wisdom and always three parts coward , i do n ’ t know why i am still live to say “ this thing 's to do , “ since i have cause , and will , and strength , and means to do it .
examples , as obvious as dirt , urge me .
look at this army , of such size and power , led by a delicate and tender prince , whose spirit , with divine ambition puffed up , makes faces at the invisible event , exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that luck , death , and danger dare to do , even for an eggshell .
rightly to be great is not to move without great argument , but to find quarrel greatly in worthless land when honor ’ s at stake .
how do i stand , then , that have a father killed , a mother stained , propn of my reason and my blood , and let all sleep while , to my shame , i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that , for a whim and trick of fame , go to their graves like going to bed , fight for a plot on which the numbers do n ’ t have room to fight for the propn , which is not tomb enough and big enough to hide the slain ?
o , from this time forth , my thoughts be bloody , or be worth nothing !
i will not speak with her .
she is unfortunate , indeed deranged .
her mood must be pitied .
what does she need ?
she speaks a lot about her father , she says she hears there are tricks in the world , and coughs , and beats her chest , propn enviously at nothing , says things in doubt that only make half sense .
her speech is nothing , yet the random use of it moves the listeners to collect them , they aim at making sense of it , and mix her words up fit to their own ideas , which , as her winks and nods and gestures as she speaks , would indeed make someone think there might be clear , though nothing for sure , yet very unhappily .
it would be good she were spoken with , because she may scatter dangerous ideas in rude minds .
let her come in .
to my sick soul , such as sin 's true nature is , each new thing seems to be the prelude to some great harm .
guilt is so full of artless jealousy , that it spills itself in fearing to be spilled .
where is the beauteous majesty of propn ?
how should i know your true love from another one ?
by his whimsical bat and his staff and his sandal shoes .
alas , sweet lady , what does this song mean ?
what did you say ?
no , i beg you , listen .
he is dead and gone , lady , he is dead and gone , at his head a grass green turf , at his heels a stone .
no , but propn i beg you , listen .
his shroud is as white as the mountain snow , propn , look here , my lord !
all covered with sweet flowers , which drowned in tears went to the grave with showers of true love .
how do you , pretty lady ?
well , propn protect you !
they say the owl was a baker 's daughter .
propn , we know what we are , but do n ’ t know what we may be .
propn be at your table !
thinking on her father .
then up he rose and put on his clothes , and opened the chamber door , let in the maid that rejected a maid and never left again .
propn propn !
indeed , la , without an oath , i ’ ll make an end on it .
by propn and by propn propn , propn , and for shame , for shame !
young men will do it if they come to it , by propn , they are to blame .
how long has she been like this ?
i hope all will be well .
we must be patient .
but i can not choose but weep , to think they would lay him in the cold ground .
my brother shall know of it .
and so i thank you for your good counsel .
come , my coach !
follow her closely , watch her well , i beg you .
o , this is the poison of deep grief , it all springs from her father 's death .
o my dear propn , this worry , compared to a murdering piece , gives me more than enough death in many places .
for pity ’ s sake , what ’ s this noise ?
where are my swiss guards ?
let them guard the door .
what is the matter ?
save yourself , my lord .
the ocean , exceeding of his borders , does n ’ t eat the flatlands with more impatient speed than young propn , heading a riot , takes over your offices .
the crowd calls him lord , and , as the world were just beginning now , old history forgotten , customs not known , they certify and prop up every word , they cry “ we choose !
o , this is rebellion , you false danish dogs !
the doors are broken .
where is this king ?
sirs , you all wait outside .
no , let 's come in .
i beg you , leave me alone .
we will , we will .
i thank you .
guard the door .
o you vile king , give me my father !
calmly , good propn .
that drop of blood that 's in control says i ’ m a bastard , propn my father ’ s wife was unfaithful , brands the harlot even here , between the chaste unmarked brows of my true mother .
what is the cause , propn , that your rebellion looks so huge ?
there 's such divinity that surrounds a king , that treason can only peep to what it would do , acts little by his will .
tell me , propn , why are you so angry like this ?
let him go , propn .
speak , man .
where is my father ?
dead .
but he did n ’ t do it .
why is he dead ?
propn , to the blackest devil !
conscience and grace , to the deepest pit !
i dare damnation .
who shall prevent you from it ?
my will alone , nothing else in the world .
and i ’ ll use my methods so well , that they shall go far with little effort .
propn propn , if you desire to know the circumstances of your dear father 's death , is it written in your revenge that , in the gambling , you will draw both friend and foe , winner and loser ?
no one but his enemies .
will you know them then ?
i ’ ll open my arms wide like this to his good friends , and , like the pelican of the old fables , feed them with my own blood .
why , now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman .
it shall penetrate your understanding that i am innocent of your father 's death , and am most sincerely in grief for it , as day penetrates your eye .
let her come in .
how now !
what ’ s that noise ?
o heat , dry up my brains !
tears with seven times the propn , burn out the sight and truth of my eyes !
dear maid , kind sister , sweet propn !
o heavens !
is it possible a young maid 's sanity should be die as does an old man ?
nature is short in love , and where it is short , it sends some precious moment of itself close to the thing it loves .
they bore him barefaced on the bier hey no nonny , nonny , hey nonny and on his grave rained many a tear .
fare you well , my dove !
had you your sanity , and you persuaded me to revenge , it could n ’ t move like this .
it is the false servant , that stole his master 's daughter .
this “ nothing ” is more than just a story .
there 's fennel for you , and columbines .
there 's rue for you , and here 's some for me .
there 's a daisy .
i would give you some violets , but they withered all when my father died .
and will he not come again ?
and will he not come again ?
no , no , he is dead , go to your death - bed , he never will come again .
his beard was as white as snow , all white was his hair .
he is gone , he is gone , and we go away crying .
propn have mercy on his soul !
and of all christian souls , i pray propn .
propn be with you .
do you see this , o propn ?
laertes , i must share your grief , or you deny me my rights .
step aside , choose whichever of your wisest friends you want , and they shall hear and judge between you and me .
if they find that we killed your father or had him killed , we will surrender our kingdom , our crown , our life , and all that we call ours , to you in satisfaction , but if not , you must be patient with us , and we shall work together with your soul to give it just compensation .
i agree , his means of death , his obscure burial , no trophy , sword , no coat of arms over his bones no noble rites or state funeral , cry to be heard , from propn to earth as it were , that i must call it into question .
and so you shall , and wherever the guilt is , that ’ s where the punishment will be .
i beg you , go with me .
who wants to speak with me ?
sailors , sir .
they say they have letters for you .
let them in .
i do n ’ t know from what part of the world i should be contacted , if not by propn propn .
propn bless you , sir .
let him bless you too .
he shall , sir , if it pleases him .
propn , when you read this , give these fellows some way to talk to the king .
they have letters for him .
before we were even at sea for two days , a very nasty looking pirate chased us .
finding ourselves sailing too slow , we put up a great fight , and , in the skirmish , i boarded them .
just then , they sailed away from our ship , so only i became their prisoner .
let the king have the letters i have sent , and come to see me with as much haste as you would fly death .
i have words to speak into your ear will make you speechless , but are they much too light for the heart of the matter .
these good fellows will bring you to where i am .
propn and propn are still going to propn .
i have much to tell you about them .
goodbye .
he that you knows you , propn .
then you can direct me to him you delivered them for .
now you must see that i am not guilty , and you must put me in your heart as a friend , since you have heard , and with a knowing ear , that man who killed your noble father wanted to kill me .
it seems to be the truth .
but tell me why did n ’ t you take action against these things , so full of crime and punishable by death , as you mainly were upset by concern for your safety , wisdom , if nothing else .
o , for two special reasons , which may to you , perhaps , seem a bit cowardly , but yet to me they are strong .
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks , and for myself , whether it ’ s my virtue or my plague , she 's so necessary to my life and soul , that , as the star moves only in his orbit , i could n ’ t do anything without her say - so .
the other motive , why i could n ’ t go to a public court , is the great love the people of this country have for him , who , dipping all his faults in their affection , would , like the spring that turn wood to stone , convert his crimes to graces , so that my actions , not at all popular with the masses , would have reflected badly on me , and not be taken as i intended them .
and so i have lost a noble father , a sister driven into insanity , whose worth , if praises may go back again , stood as a challenger to the most beautiful woman of all time for her perfections .
but my revenge will come .
do n ’ t lose any sleep over it .
you must n ’ t think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our power be shaken with danger , and think it unimportant .
you will soon hear more .
what news ?
letters , my lord , from propn .
this one to your majesty , this one to the queen .
from propn !
who brought them ?
sailors , my lord , they say , i did n ’ t see them .
laertes , you shall hear them .
leave us alone .
high and mighty , you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom .
what does this mean ?
are all the rest returning ?
or is it some trick and no such thing ?
do you recognize the writing ?
it ’ s propn 's handwriting .
i have no idea , my lord .
but let him come .
how can it be otherwise ?
yes , my lord , just as long as you do n ’ t ask me to forget about it .
only to your own satisfaction .
it ’ s falling into place .
you have been talked about since your travel so much , for a quality where , they say , you really shine .
all your parts together did n ’ t arouse such jealousy in him as did that one , and that , in my regard , is his weak spot .
what part is that , my lord ?
a very ribbon in the cap of youth , but necessary too , for youth does n ’ t look less well in the fun and reckless clothes that it wears than old age settles for his black furs and woolens , showing health and seriousness .
two months ago , there was a gentleman from propn here , i ’ ve seen myself , and served against the propn , and they can do well on horseback , but this gallant had witchcraft in it .
he grew into his seat , and had his horse do such wonderful things , as if he had been absorbed into the horse ’ s body with the brave beast .
he so impressed me , that i , through lies and tricks , did n ’ t waste time in finding out what he did .
a propn , was it ?
a propn .
i swear , propn .
the very same .
i know him well .
he is the jewel , indeed , and gem of the whole nation .
propn , this report of his propn propn with envy that he could n ’ t do anything but wish and beg your sudden coming over her to play with him .
laertes , was your father dear to you ?
not that i think you did n ’ t love your father , but because i know love is begun by time , and i see , in the ways of love , that time dampens the spark and fire of it .
within the very flame of love , there lives a kind of wick or snuff that will put it out , and nothing is worse than goodness staying still , for goodness , growing to an infectious flu , propn in his own too much .
what we want to do , we should do when we would , for this ' would ' changes , and has stoppages and delays as many as there are voices , hands , accidents , and then this ' should ' is like the sigh of a spendthrift , that hurts by easing up .
but to the heart of the matter .
propn comes back .
what would you do to show yourself your father 's son in deed more than in words ?
to cut his throat in the church .
murder , indeed , should not be a church activity , because then revenge should have no bounds .
when propn returns , he shall know you ’ re home .
we 'll start rumors that praise your excellence and exaggerate the fame the propn gave you , bring you together in the end , and place bets on your fight .
he , being weak , most generous , and free from all trickery , will not think about swords , so that easily , or with a little mix up , you may choose a sword that ’ s not poisoned , and , in a pass during practice , kill him in revenge for your father .
i ’ ll do it .
and for that purpose , i ’ ll poison my sword .
i bought an oil of a mountebank , so mortal that , only dip a knife in it , where it draws blood , no super - potion so rare , collected from all antidotes under the moon that have always worked , can save the thing from death and this is only with a scratch .
i ’ ll touch the point of my sword with this poison so that , if i touch him slightly , it will kill him .
therefore this project should have a plan b or c , that might hold if this first one failed .
hang on !
let me think .
we 'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings , i have it !
while you ’ re moving around and you are hot and dry , since you ’ ll make your bouts more violent to that purpose , and he calls for drink , i ’ ll have prepared a propn for him for that purpose , so that even only sipping , if he escapes your stick of venom by luck , we can be successful this way .
what now , sweet queen !
one sorrow walks on the heels of another , following too fast .
your sister 's drowned , propn .
drowned !
o , where ?
alas , then she is drowned ?
drowned , drowned .
you had too much water , poor propn , and therefore i ’ ll hold back my tears , but it is still our trick , nature holds her habits , let shame say what it will .
when these tears are gone , propn will be extinct .
propn , my lord .
i have a rumor of fire , that i would gladly spread , before this news puts the fire out .
let 's follow him , propn , .
i had all i could do to calm his anger !
now i fear this will make it start all over again , therefore let 's follow him .
is she to be buried in christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation ?
i tell you she is , and therefore make her grave straight .
the coroner has decided , and finds it christian burial .
how can that be , unless she drowned herself in her own defense ?
why , that ’ s the coroner ’ s finding .
it must be self - offense .
it ca n ’ t be anything else .
here lies the water , good .
here stands the man , good .
but is this law ?
yes , by propn , it ’ s the coroner ’ s inquest law .
will you know the truth about it ?
if this had n ’ t been a gentlewoman , she should have been buried without a christian burial .
why , there you ’ ve said it .
and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than another propn .
come , my spade .
there are no old gentlemen but gardeners , ditchers , and grave - makers .
they hold up propn 's profession .
was he a gentleman ?
he was the first that ever bore arms .
why , he had none .
what , are you a pagan ?
how do you understand the scripture ?
the scripture says propn digged .
could he dig without arms ?
i ’ ll put another question to you .
the gallows - maker , for that frame outlives a thousand tenants .
i like your joke , i swear .
do it again , come on .
who builds stronger than a mason , a shipbuilder , or a carpenter ?
yes , tell me that , and stop my guessing .
by propn , now i can tell .
do it .
mass , i can not tell .
go , get you to propn , bring me a mug of whiskey .
in youth when i did love , did love , i thought it was very sweet , to contract , o , the time for , ah , my reason , o , i thought there was nothing meet .
has this fellow no feeling of his business , that he sings at grave - digging ?
propn has made it a property of easiness in him .
that ’ s true .
the one that does n ’ t work has the more delicate sense .
but age , with his stealing steps , has clawed me in his clutch , and has shipped me until the land , as if i had never been such .
that skull had a tongue in it , and could sing once .
how the man jowls it to the ground , as if it were propn 's jawbone , that did the first murder !
this might be the head of a politician , which this ass now reaches over one that would go around propn , might it not ?
it might , my lord .
or of a courtier , which could say ' good morrow , sweet lord !
how are you , good lord ?
this might be my lord so - and - so , that praised my lord such - and - such 's horse when he meant to ask for it , might it not ?
yes , my lord .
why , even so .
and now my propn propn 's , no jaw and knocked about the face with a sexton 's spade .
here 's fine turnaround , if we were able to see it .
did these bones cost no more the making of them but to play at games with them ?
mine ache to think about it .
a pickaxe and a spade , a spade , for and a shrouding sheet , propn a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is ptoper .
there 's another .
why ca n ’ t that be the skull of a lawyer ?
where are his arguments now , his pens , his cases , his subpoenas , and his tricks ?
why does he allow this rude fellow to knock him about the head now , with a dirty shovel , and will not tell him why he ’ s being hit ?
hum !
this fellow might have been a great buyer of land in his time , with his statutes , his emblems , his fine art , his double billing , his house seizures ?
is this the finest of his fine art , and the seizure of his house seizures , to have his fine pate full of fine dirt ?
will his billing bill him no more for his purchases , and double ones too , than the length and breadth of a pair of property liens ?
the very transfers of his lands will scarcely lie in this box , and must the inheritor himself have no more , huh ?
not a jot more , my lord .
is n ’ t parchment made of sheep - skins ?
yes , my lord , and of calf - skins too .
they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that .
i will speak to this fellow .
whose grave is this , sir ?
mine , sir .
o , a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet .
i think it ’ s yours indeed , for you lie in it .
you lie out of it , sir , and therefore it ’ s not yours .
for my part , i do n ’ t lie in it , yet it ‘ s mine .
you do lie in it , to be in it and say it is yours .
it is for the dead , not for the quick , therefore you lie .
it is a quick lie , sir , it will go away again from me to you .
what man dot you dig it for ?
for no man , sir .
what woman then ?
for none neither .
who is to be buried in it ?
one that was a woman , sir , but , rest her soul , she 's dead .
how absolutely clever this chap is !
we must speak by the book or lying will undo us .
by the propn , propn , these three years i have noted that the age is grown so picky that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier , he hurts his feelings .
how long have you been a grave - maker ?
of all the days in the year , i became a grave - maker the day that our last propn propn overcame propn .
how long is that since ?
ca n ’ t you tell that ?
every fool can tell that .
it was the very day that young propn was born , he that is crazy and sent into propn .
yes , by propn , why was he sent to propn ?
he shall get his mind back there , or , if he does n ’ t , it 's no great problem there .
why ?
it will not be seen in him there .
there the men are as crazy as he is .
how did he become crazy ?
very strangely , they say .
how strangely ?
actually , even by losing his mind .
on what grounds ?
why , here in propn .
i have been sexton here , man and boy , thirty years .
how long will a man lie in the earth before he rots ?
well , if he ’ s not rotten before he dies , as we have many small pox corpses nowadays that will scarce last beyond the wake , he will last you some eight years or nine years .
a tanner will last you nine years .
why he more than another ?
why , sir , his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while , and your water is a sore decayer of your wretched dead body .
here 's a skull now .
this skull has been buried three - and - twenty years .
whose was it ?
a bastard , crazy fellow 's it was .
whose do you think it was ?
no , i know not .
a pestilence on him for a crazy rogue !
he poured a pint of propn wine on my head once .
this same skull , sir , was propn 's skull , the king 's jester .
this one ?
just that one .
alas , poor propn !
i knew him , propn , a fellow of infinite fun , of most excellent imagination .
i want to vomit .
here hung those lips that i have kissed i do n ’ t know how many times .
where are your jokes now ?
your games ?
your songs ?
your flashes of laughter that always make the audience roar ?
no one now , to mock your own grinning ?
quite jaw - fallen ?
i beg you , propn , tell me one thing .
what 's that , my lord ?
do you think propn the propn looked like this in the earth ?
yuck !
just like that , my lord .
what common uses we may return to , propn !
why ca n ’ t imagination trace the noble dust of propn until he finds it stopping a wine barrel ?
it ’ s thinking about it too much to think like that .
propn propn , dead and turned to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
o , that the earth which kept the world in fear should patch a wall to expel the winter 's cold !
but quiet !
who is that they ’ re following ?
and with such shortened rites ?
this shows that the corpse they follow did , with a desperate hand , propn suicide .
it was of some nobility .
let ’ s hide and listen .
what other ceremony ?
that is propn , a very noble youth .
look .
what other ceremony ?
her funeral rites have been as far enlarged as we can enlarge .
is n ’ t there more be done ?
lay her in the earth , and may violets spring from her fair and unpolluted flesh !
i tell you , churlish priest , my sister shall be a ministering angel when you lie howling .
what , the fair propn ?
sweets to the sweet .
farewell .
i hoped you would have been my propn 's wife , i thought to have decorated your bride - bed , sweet maid , and not your grave .
o , three times sorrow fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed deprived you of your most wonderful intelligence !
stop the burial a while , until i hold her once more in mine arms .
now bury the living and dead , until you have made a mountain from this flat earth to be higher than the mountain of propn or the skyish head of blue propn propn .
this is i , propn the propn .
the devil take your soul !
you do n ’ t pray well .
i beg you , take your fingers from my throat , for , although i am not impatient and rash , i still have something dangerous in me , which you should fear .
take away your hand !
separate them .
gentlemen !
my good lord , be quiet .
why , i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer blink .
o my son , what theme ?
i loved propn !
forty thousand brothers could n ’ t , even with all their quantity of love , make up my sum .
what will you do for her ?
o , he is crazy , propn .
for love of propn , leave him alone !
propn ’ s wounds , show me what you 'll do .
i ’ ll do it .
be buried quickly with her , and so will i .
and , if you babble about mountains , let them throw millions of acres on us , until our ground , singeing his head against the burning sun , make the highest mountain like a wart !
no , if you ’ ll speak , i ’ ll rant as well as you .
eventually , as patient as the female dove when that her golden twins are discovered , his silence will sit drooping .
i always loved you .
but it ’ s not important .
let propn himself do what he may , the cat will mew and every dog will have his day .
propn propn , put a guard over your son .
this grave shall have a living monument .
so much for this , sir .
now as for the other thing , you do remember all the circumstances ?
remember it , my lord !
propn , there was a kind of fighting in my heart that would n ’ t let me sleep .
i thought i lay worse than in a rebellion , in the chains .
such ghosts and goblins in my life , that , on my arrival , without any delay , no , not even to wait for the grinding of the axe , my head should be chopped off .
is it possible ?
but will you listen to how i proceeded ?
go ahead ..
being surrounded like this with evil plans , before i could start thinking about it , before they could execute the plan , i sat myself down , though up a new order , wrote it just like the original .
i used to think , as our politicians do , a sin to make a forgery and worked hard at how to forget that learning , but , sir , now it did me a useful service .
do you want to know the effect of what i wrote ?
yes , good my lord .
an earnest oath from the king , as propn was his faithful ally , as love between them might flourish like the palm tree , as peace should still wear her wheaten garland and stand like a comma between their friendships , and many “ as - es ” like that of great emotion , that , on the view and knowledge of these contents , without further discussion , more or less , he should the bearers put to sudden death , not even allowing time for confession and penance .
how was this sealed ?
why , even in that was propn good to me .
now , the next day was our sea - fight , and what followed you know already .
so propn and propn go to it .
why , man , they did make love to this job .
their defeat grew by their own actions .
it is dangerous when the lower nature comes between the ups and downs of mighty opposites .
why , what a king is this !
does n ’ t it , do you thank , become my responsibility to kill he that has killed my king , and whored my mother , push himself in between the election and my hope to be propn , tried to kill me , and with such knowledge , is n ’ t it perfect duty to kill him with this arm ?
and is n ’ t it to be damned to let this canker of our nature do further evil ?
the time between is mine , and a man 's life is longer than it takes to say “ one .
but i am very sorry , good propn , that i forgot myself to propn , because , by the image of my cause , i can see myself in him .
i ’ ll court his favors .
but , for sure , the bravery of his grief put me into a towering passion .
propn , who ’ s coming here ?
your lordship is right welcome back to propn .
i humbly thank you , sir .
do you know this water - fly ?
no , my good lord .
your state is the more gracious , for it is a vice to know him .
he has much fertile land .
let a beast be lord of beasts , and his cattle shall stand at the king 's dinner table .
he ’ s a clown , but , as i say , proud to own dirt .
sweet lord , if your lordship were not busy , i should impart a thing to you from his majesty .
i will listen very carefully .
put your hat to its right use .
it is for the head .
i thank your lordship , it is very hot .
no , believe me , it is very cold , the wind is northerly .
it is unusually cold , my lord , indeed .
i think it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
exceedingly , my lord , it is very sultry , i ca n ’ t tell how .
but , my lord , his majesty asked me to tell you that he has placed a great wager on your head .
propn , here propn is newly come to court , believe me , an absolute gentleman , full of most excellent traits , of very soft manners and looking great .
indeed , to speak feelingly of him , he is the card or calendar of gentry , because you shall find in him the continent of what a gentleman is .
propn , his refinement suffers no lie from you , although , i know , to divide him like an inventor would make the memory dizzy with arithmetic , and yet not off course , in regard to his quick sail .
but , in the truth of praise , i take him to be a soul of great note , and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as , to make true talk of him , he is what you see , and whoever copies him , is his shadow , nothing more .
your lordship speaks most truly of him .
the concern sir ?
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rare breath ?
propn ?
is n ’ t it possible to understand in another tongue ?
you will do it , propn , really .
what about the naming of this gentleman ?
of propn ?
of him , sir .
well , sir .
i mean , sir , for his weapon , but in the imputation laid on him by them , in his skill , he has no equal .
what 's his weapon ?
propn and dagger .
that 's two of his weapons .
but never mind .
what do you call the carriages ?
i knew you must be aware of the margin before you had finished .
the carriages , sir , are the hangers .
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannons by our sides .
i would it might be hangers till then .
but , on .
why is this all wagered , as you call it ?
what if i say no ?
i mean , my lord , the fight of your person in trial .
propn , i will walk here in the hall .
if it please his majesty , it is the relaxing time of day with me .
shall i re - deliver your answer like that ?
with my meaning , sir , however you want to say it .
i commend my duty to your lordship .
yours , yours .
he does well to praise himself , because no one else will praise him .
a just hatched bird runs away with eggshell on his head .
he did comply with his mother ’ s breast before he sucked it .
he has , and many more just like him that i know the worthless age dotes on , are only part of a craze and have the outward appearance of style , a kind of swollen collection , which carries them through and through the most airless opinions and only blows them to their real experience when the bubbles are burst .
my lord , his majesty sent a message to you by propn propn , who tells him that you will meet him in the hall .
he want to know if will play with propn now , or whether you will take a longer time .
i am true to my intentions ; they follow the king 's pleasure .
if he is ready now , i am too , now or whenever , provided that i am so able as i am now .
the propn and propn and all are coming down .
in happy time .
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to propn before you start to play .
she instructs me well .
you will lose this wager , my lord .
i do n ’ t think so .
since he went to propn , i have been in constant practice .
i shall win at the odds .
but you would n ’ t know what a bad feeling i have inside .
but it does n ’ t matter .
no , my good lord , it ’ s only foolishness , but it is such a kind of misgiving as would maybe trouble a woman .
if you have a gut feeling , obey it .
being ready is everything .
since no man has anything of what he leaves , what is it to leave soon ?
come , propn , come , and take this hand from me .
give me your pardon , sir .
this propn knows , and you must have heard , how i am punished with a painful madness .
what i have done that might deeply hurt your nature , honor , and complaints , i here proclaim was craziness .
was it propn who wronged laertes ?
never propn .
who does it , then ?
his madness .
propn , before this audience , let my denial of evil intent give me immunity in your most generous thoughts as though i have shot my arrow over the house and hurt my brother .
i am satisfied in nature , whose motive , in this case , should move me the most to my revenge .
but in my terms of honor i hold back , and will make no reconciliation until , by some elder masters of known honor , i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name unbloody .
but until that time , i receive your offered love like love , and wo n ’ t do it wrong .
i accept it freely , and will play this brother 's wager honestly .
give us the swords , come on .
come , one for me .
i ’ ll be your mirror , propn .
in my ignorance , your skill shall , like a star in the darkest night , be shown to its fiery advantage indeed .
you mock me , sir .
no , honestly .
give them the swords , propn propn .
propn propn , you know the wager ?
i have seen you both , but since he 's gotten better , we have , therefore , odds .
i like this one .
all these swords have a length ?
yes , my good lord .
set up the goblets of wine for me on that table .
if propn gives the first or second hit , or quits in answer of the third exchange , let all the battlements fire their ammunition , the king shall drink to propn 's better breath , and in the cup he shall throw a pearl , richer than that which four successive kings have worn in propn 's crown .
give me the cups , and let the kettle drum speak to the trumpet , the trumpet to the cannon man outside , the cannons to the heavens , the heavens to earth , ' now the king drinks to propn . ” come , begin .
and you , the judges , watch carefully .
come on , sir .
come , my lord .
one .
no .
judges ?
a hit , a hit that was felt .
ok , again .
stay , give me drink .
propn , this pearl is your , here 's to your health .
give him the cup .
i ’ ll play this bout first , put it aside a while .
come on .
a touch , a touch , i do confess .
our son shall win .
he 's fat , and out of breath .
the queen drinks to your fortune , propn .
good madam !
propn , do n ’ t drink .
i will , my lord , i beg you to pardon me .
it is the poisoned cup ; it is too late .
i dare not drink yet , madam , by and by .
come , let me wipe your face .
my lord , i ’ ll hit him now .
i do n ’ t think so .
and yet it is almost against my conscience .
come , for the third , propn .
you say so ?
come on .
nothing , neither way .
i ’ ll attack you now !
part them .
they are in a rage .
look to the queen there , ho !
they bleed on both sides .
how are you , my lord ?
how are you , propn ?
why , as a woodpecker caught in my own trap , propn .
i am justly killed with my own wickedness .
how is the propn ?
she swoons to see them bleed .
no , no !
i am poisoned .
o villainy !
ho !
let the doors be locked .
wickedness !
find it !
it is here , propn .
propn , you are killed , no medicine in the world can save you .
the evil deed has turned itself on me .
propn , here i lie , never to rise again .
your mother 's poisoned .
i can do no more .
the propn , the propn 's to blame .
the point poisoned too !
then , venom , do your work .
treason !
treason !
o , still defend me , friends !
i am only hurt .
here , you incestuous , murderous , damned propn , drink this potion .
is your marriage here ?
follow my mother .
exchange forgiveness with me , noble propn .
and i am not guilty of yours .
propn forgive you for it !
i follow you .
i am dead , propn .
wretched queen , goodbye !
never believe it .
i am more an antique propn than a propn .
here 's some poison wine still left .
o good propn , what a wounded name that is , things left unknown like this , shall live after me !
if you ever did hold me in your heart , stay away from happy things for a while , and , in this harsh world , draw your breath in pain to tell my story .
what warlike noise is this ?
propn propn , after conquering propn , gives this warlike volley to the ambassadors of propn .
i can not live to hear the news from propn , but i do predict that the throne belongs to propn .
now a noble heart breaks .
good night , sweet prince , and flights of angels sing you to your rest !
why does the drum come here ?
where is this sight ?
what do you want to see ?
if anything of sorrow or wonder , stop your search .
this scene is chaotic .
o proud death , what feast is being held in your eternal cell , that you have killed so many princes so bloodily all at the same time ?
the sight is sad , and our affairs come too late from propn .
the ears that should give us hearing ca n ’ t hear , to tell him his order is obeyed , that propn and propn are dead .
who will thank us ?
no thanks from his mouth , if it were alive to thank you .
he never gave orders for their deaths .
but since , you from the propn wars , and you from propn , are here arrived , and so jump on this bloody question , give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view , and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about .
so you shall hear of carnal , bloody and unnatural acts , of accidental judgments , casual slaughters , of deaths planned by cunning and false causes , and , in this result , mistaken motives fallen on the planners ' heads .
i can truly deliver all this .
let us hurry to hear it , and call the noblest to hear it too .
as for me , i embrace my fortune with sorrow .
i have some rights of past history in this kingdom , which now invites me to claim my place .
i shall also have cause to speak of that , and directly from his mouth whose voice will deliver it .
but let this speaking be done now , even while men 's minds are wild , lest more mischance on plots and errors happen .
let four captains propn propn like a soldier to the platform , for he was likely , had he been propn , to have proved most royal , and , for his passage , the soldiers ' music and the rites of war will speak loudly for him .
take up the bodies .
away !
go home , you idle creatures , go home !
why , sir , i ’ m a carpenter .
where is your leather apron and your ruler ?
truly , sir , in respect of a fine worker , i ’ m only , as you would say a cobbler .
but what ’ s your trade ?
just tell me that .
a trade , sir , that i hope i may use with a clear conscience , which is indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .
what ’ s your trade , you deceitful man ?
you naughty , deceitful man , what ’ s your trade ?
no , please , sir , do n ’ t be angry with me ; yet , if you ’ re angry , sir , i can mend you .
what do you mean by that ?
mend me , you rude fellow !
yes , sir , mend you .
you ’ re a mender , are you ?
propn , propn , all that i live by is with the sharp little tool ; i do n ’ t stick my nose into any tradesman 's matters , or women 's matters , but with awl .
i ’ m indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes ; when they ’ re in great danger , i re - cover them .
many proper men that ever walked on cowhide leather have walked on my work .
but why are n ’ t you in your shop today ?
why do you lead these men in the streets ?
truly , sir , so i can wear out their shoes to get myself more work .
but , really , sir , we have taken a holiday to see propn and to rejoice in his triumph .
why rejoice ?
what conquest does he bring home ?
what people who pay him tribute follow him to propn , to decorate his chariot ’ s wheels with their chains and bonds ?
you blocks , you stones , you worse than senseless things !
o you hard hearts , you cruel men of propn , did n ’ t you know propn ?
many times , you ’ ve climbed up to the walls and lookout posts , to the towers and windows , yes , to chimney tops , your infants in your arms , and you ’ ve sat there the entire day , waiting patiently to see great propn pass through the streets of propn .
and when you saw his chariot appear , have n ’ t you made one great big shout that was so loud the propn propn trembled underneath her banks to hear the echo of your sounds that bounced off her hollow shores ?
and do you now put on your best attire ?
and now you decide to call a holiday ?
and now you throw flowers in the way if the man that comes in triumph over propn 's death ?
get going !
run to your houses , fall on your knees , pray to the gods to stop the plague that must be the punishment for this ingratitude .
go , go , good countrymen , and , for this mistake , get all the poor men like you together , bring them to the propn propn ’ s banks and weep your tears into the water , until the lowest stream propn the highest shores of propn .
see whether they ’ ll really do what you suggested ; their guilt made them vanish in silence .
you go down that way towards the propn ; i ’ ll go this way .
may we do that ?
you know it is the feast of the priest propn .
it does n ’ t matter ; do n ’ t let the statues be hung with propn 's trophies .
i 'll go around and drive the low people away from the streets ; you do this too , where you see many of them gathered together .
propn speaks .
stand directly in propn ’ s way , when he runs his course .— propn propn , my lord ?
i ’ ll remember .
when propn says , `` do this , `` i do it .
go on , and do n ’ t leave any ritual out .
propn !
ha !
who calls ?
everyone , quiet.— peace !
who ’ s calling for me ?
i hear a voice that is more shrill than all the music yelling , `` propn `` !
beware the propn of propn .
who is that man ?
a man who can tell the future is telling you to beware propn 15 .
bring him here ; let me see his face .
propn , come here ; look at propn .
what do you say to me now ?
speak again .
beware the propn of propn .
he ’ s a dreamer ; let ’ s get away from him .
let ’ s go .
will you go see the order of the winners of the race ?
i do n ’ t like games ; i lack some part of that quick spirit that propn has .
do n ’ t let me hold you up , propn , go if you like ; i 'll leave you .
you ’ re too stubborn and too strange to your friend that loves you .
i ’ m annoyed lately with different passions , propn that only i can know , which are perhaps seen in my behavior ; but do n ’ t let my good friends be propn propn , you ’ re one of them— or try to understand my indifference any further than that poor propn , at war with himself , forgets to show friendship to other men .
then , propn , i have really misunderstood your passions , which is why this my heart has forgotten thoughts of great value , worthy thoughts .
tell me , good propn , can you see your face ?
no , propn , because the eye can only see itself in a mirror or by some other thing like it .
and it ’ s very much lamented , propn , that you do n ’ t have any mirrors that will let you see your own hidden worthiness , any mirrors that you might let you see your shadow .
i have heard that many of the best - respected men in rome , — except immortal propn speak about propn , and groaning underneath the political burden of this age , have wished that noble propn could see what they see .
what dangers would you lead me into , propn , that you want me to search for something that i do n ’ t have in myself ?
for that reason , good propn , get ready to hear what i have to say ; and since you know you ca n ’ t see yourself except in a mirror , i ’ ll be your mirror , and will modestly let you see that in yourself which you do n ’ t know about .
and do n ’ t be angry with me , gentle propn ; i wish i were a common comedian , or used to urinating on my friendship with ordinary oaths to every new opponent ; if you know that i show false friendship to some men , and hug them hard and after that , tell lies about them , or if you know that i profess myself at feasts to be friends with the entire place , then think about me dangerous .
what does this shouting mean ?
i ’ m afraid the people are going to choose propn for their king .
yes , you fear it ?
then i must think you would n ’ t want it .
what do you want to tell me ?
i know you ’ ve that virtue , propn , as well as i know your face .
well , honor is the subject of my story .
i ca n ’ t tell what you and other men think of this life ; but , for myself alone , i would rather not live to be in awe of such a thing as i ’ m .
and indeed he did so .
and now this man has become a god , and propn is a wretched creature , and must bow , even if propn only nods at him carelessly .
he had a fever when he was in propn , and , when the fit was on him , i noticed how he shook .
i heard him groan .
another general shout !
i believe that this applause is for some new honors that are to be heaped on propn .
why , man , he stands on top of the narrow world like the propn of propn , and we little men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves disgraceful graves .
propn `` and `` propn . ” what is in that name , `` propn ?
why should that name be sounded any more than yours ?
write them down together ; your name is just as good ; say them out loud ; your name sounds just as good ; think about their importance , yours is just as important ; use them to contact ghosts , `` propn `` will bring a spirit as soon as `` propn .
now , in the names of all the gods at once , what meat does this our propn eat that he ’ s grown so great ?
age , shame on you !
propn , there are no more people of noble bloods in you !
has there ever been any age since propn and the flood that was not famous because of more than one man ?
when could they say , until now , those that talked about propn , that her wide walls were ruled by only one man ?
is propn still propn , and does it have room enough , when there is in it only one man ?
o , you and i have heard our fathers say there was a propn once that would have fought the eternal devil to keep his status in propn , as easily as he would fight a king !
i ’ m not angry that you ’ re my friend ; as for what you ’ re persuading me to do , i have some plans .
i ’ ll tell you later what i ’ ve thought about this and about these times , ; for now , please do n ’ t to try to persuade me any further .
i ’ ll think about what you ’ ve said ; i ’ ll patiently hear what you ’ ve to say , and find a time when i can both meet with you to hear and answer such high things .
i ’ m glad that my weak words have brought out this show of fire from propn .
the games are finished , and propn is returning .
as they pass by , grab propn by the sleeve ; and he ’ ll , in his sour way , tell you what notable events have happened today .
propn 's cheek is pale , and propn looks with the same beady and fiery eyes that we have seen on him in the propn , when some senators disagreed with him in a meeting .
propn will tell us what ’ s wrong .
propn propn ?
do n ’ t be afraid of him , propn ; he 's not dangerous ; he ’ s a noble propn and has a good disposition .
i wish he were fatter !
he reads a lot ; he ’ s a great observer , and actually he looks through the deeds of men .
such men as he is are never at ease in their hearts when they see a man greater than themselves ; and for that reason they are very dangerous .
i would rather tell you what to be afraid of more than what i am afraid of , for i ’ m always propn .
come over here my right side , because i am deaf in this ear , and tell me what you really think of him .
you pulled my sleeve ; do you want to speak with me ?
yes , propn , tell us what has happened today that makes propn look so sad .
why , you were with him , were n ’ t you ?
if i was , then i should n ’ t ask propn what had happened .
why , there was a crown offered to him , and when it was offered to him , he pushed it away with the back of his hand , like this , and then the people started shouting .
what was the second noise for ?
why , for that too .
they shouted three times .
what was the last cry for ?
why , for that too .
was the crown offered to him three times ?
yes , damn it , it was , and he pushed it aside three times , every time more gently than the last , and at each pushing aside , my honest neighbors shouted .
who offered him the crown ?
why , propn .
tell us how it happened , gentle propn .
i may as well be hanged as to tell how it happened .
it was merely a joke ; i did n ’ t pay attention to it .
i saw propn propn offer him a crown ; — yet it was n ’ t a crown either , it was one of these large hats ; — and , as i told you , he pushed it aside once .
but , for all that , to my thinking , he seemed eager to have it .
but , to my thinking , he was very reluctant to remove his fingers off it .
and then he was offered it the third time ; he pushed it aside the third time , and still , as he refused it , the crowd shouted , and clapped their rough hands , and threw their sweaty night hats into the air , and uttered such a great deal of stinking breath because propn refused the crown , that the smell almost choked propn , because he fainted and fell down from it .
and , for mine part , i did n ’ t dare laugh for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the bad air .
what , did propn faint ?
he fell down in the market place , foamed at the mouth , and was speechless .
no , propn does n ’ t have it ; but you , and i , and honest propn , we have epilepsy .
i do n ’ t know what you mean by that , but i ’ m sure propn fell down .
if the common people did n ’ t applaud him and hiss at him , since he pleased and displeased them , as they used to do to the actors in the theatre , then i ’ m not really a man .
what said he when he came to ?
propn it , before he fell down , when he thought the common herd was glad he had refused the crown , he opened his shirt , and offered to cut his throat .
when he came to again , he said , if he had done or said anything out of order , he wanted the people to think it was his infirmity .
if propn had stabbed their mothers , they would have done the same thing .
and , after that he came , away sad ?
yes .
did cicero say anything ?
yes , he spoke in propn .
how did that work ?
goodbye .
there was more nonsense , if i could only remember it .
will you have dinner with me tonight , propn ?
no , i ’ ve got another engagement .
will you dine with me tomorrow ?
yes , if i ’ m alive , and your mind hold , and your dinner worth the eating .
good , i ’ ll expect you .
what a blunt fellow he ’ s turned out to be !
he was becoming very spirited when he was in school .
so he is now in getting any bold or noble job done ; however , he pretends to be slow in nature .
this rudeness is the topping to his good traits , which lets men accept his words with better understanding .
and so it is .
i ’ ll leave you now .
tomorrow , if you want to speak with me , i ’ ll come to your house ; or , if you like , come to my house , and i ’ ll wait for you .
ok , that ’ s fine .
tonight , i will throw writings in his windows , all tending to the great opinion that propn holds his name , by several different hands , as if they came from several citizens , in these writings , i will analyze , although obscurely , propn 's ambition .
and after this , let propn sit more securely on his throne , because we will shake him from there , or endure worse days .
good evening , propn .
did you bring propn home ?
why are you breathless , and why are you staring like that ?
are n ’ t you moved , when the entire earth is shaking uncontrollably ?
either there is a civil strife in propn , or else the world has been too impudent with the gods , incensing them to send destruction .
why , have you seen anything more wonderful ?
a common slave — propn know him well by sight— held up his left hand , which flamed and burned like twenty torches all together , and yet his hand , not feeling any fire , was n ’ t even scorched .
besides , — i have n ’ t used my sword since— i met a lion , in front of the propn , who glared at me , and angrily passed me by , without attacking me , and there were a hundred ghastly propn gathered in a heap , transformed by their fear ; who swore they saw propn , all on fire , walking up and down the streets .
and yesterday , the night bird sat in the marketplace , in the middle of the day , howling and shrieking .
when these omens all happen at the same time , do n ’ t let men say `` these things have their reasons ; they ’ re natural , `` for i believe they ’ re warning signs that predict the climate that they point to .
indeed , time has a strange disposition but men may interpret things in whatever way they like , far from the purpose of the things themselves .
does propn come to the propn tomorrow ?
he does , because he asked propn to send word to you that he would be there tomorrow .
good then , propn .
this disturbed sky is n ’ t one to walk in .
propn , propn .
who 's there ?
a propn .
propn , i can tell by your voice .
you have a good ear .
propn , what night this is !
a very pleasing night to honest men .
who ever knew the heavens could be so threatening ?
those men that know the earth is full of faults .
for my part , i have walked about the streets , giving in to the dangerous night ; and , undressed like this , propn , as you can see , i have bared my chest to the thunder bolts ; and when the angry , blue lightning seemed to openthe chest of propn , i put myself even in the direction and the very flash of it .
but why did you tempt the sky like that ?
it is part of men to be afraid and tremble when the most mighty gods send lightening to astonish us .
you ’ re not too sharp , propn , and those sparks of life that should be in a propn , you want , or else , you do n ’ t use what you have .
you look pale and dazed , and put on fear and make yourself wonder , to see the strange behavior of the propn .
but if you would think about the true cause , why all these fires , why all these gliding ghosts , why birds and beasts , from quality and kind ; why old men , fools , and children think about it— why all these things change from their usual order , change their natures , and their normal events to monstrous disorder — why , you shall find that propn has infused the lightening with these spirits , to make them instruments of fear and warning about some monstrous state .
now i could , propn , propn a man to you that is most like this dreadful night , one that thunders , send lightening , opens graves , and roars , as the lion in the propn does ; a man no mightier in personal action ; than you or i , yet he ’ s grown monstrous , and fearful , just as these strange eruptions are .
it ’ s propn that you mean , is n ’ t it , propn ?
our fathers ' minds are dead , and we are governed by our mothers ' spirits ; our burden and suffering makes us look womanish .
indeed they say that the senators propn to establish propn as a king tomorrow , and that he will be king everywhere , in every place , except here in propn .
in that event , you gods , you make the weak the strongest ; in that event , you gods , you defeat tyrants .
no stony tower , no walls of beaten brass , no airless dungeon , no strong chains of iron can hold the strength of the spirit ; but life , tired of these worldly bars , never lacks the power to kill itself .
if i know this , and know the whole world too , i can shake off at pleasure that part of tyranny that i endure .
i can too .
and so every slave has in his own hand the power to cancel his captivity .
and why should propn be a tyrant then ?
poor man !
i know he would n ’ t be a wolf , but he sees that the propn are nothing but sheep .
he would n ’ t be a lion if propn were n ’ t female deer .
those that are in a hurry will make a mighty fire and start it with flimsy straws .
what trash propn is , what rubbish , and what garbage , when it serves as the fuel to start a fire that will throw light on so vile a thing as propn !
but , o grief , where have you taken me ?
perhaps i say this before a willing slave .
stay , take my hand .
be a rebel for revenge for all these problems , and i ’ ll support you as far as the man who goes the farthest .
it ’ s a deal .
now you know , propn , i have already persuaded some certain of the noblest - minded propn to join me in an undertaking of honorable / dangerous consequence ; and i know by this , they are waiting for me in propn 's propn .
for now , because of this fearful night , there ’ s no noise or walking in the streets , and the weather reflects the work we have at hand , most bloody , fiery , and most terrible .
stand next to me for a while , because someone is coming hastily .
to find you .
who 's that ?
propn propn ?
no , it is propn , one who agrees with our attempts .
is n ’ t someone waiting for me , propn ?
i ’ m glad about it .
what a fearful night is this !
there 's two or three of us who have seen strange sights .
is n ’ t someone waiting for me ?
tell me .
yes , they are .
o propn , if you could only persuade the noble propn to join us— do n ’ t worry .
when you ’ ve done all that , go to propn 's propn , where you shall find us .
are propn propn and propn there ?
all but propn propn , and he 's gone to your house to find you .
well , i ’ ll get going and so deliver these papers as you asked me .
three parts of him are ours already , and , at our next meeting , the whole man will be ours .
you ’ ve judge his worth , and our great need of him , very well .
let ’ s go , because it is after midnight , and , before day , we ’ ll wake him up , and be sure that he ’ s with us .
wake up , i say !
hey , propn !
you called , my lord ?
light a candle in my study , propn .
when it is lit , come back and call me here .
i will , my lord .
he must die , and , for my part , i do n ’ t know a personal cause to throw at him , but for the general complaints .
a bright day brings out the black , poison snake , and that means we must walk carefully .
propn him ? — that .
and then , i admit , he may do danger , at his will , with a sting that we put in him .
the abuse of greatness is when it disconnects remorse from power , and , to speak truth about propn , i have n ’ t known a time when his emotions were swayed more than his reason .
the candle burns in your bedroom , sir .
searching the window for a match , i found this paper sealed up like this , and i ’ m sure it was n ’ t there when i went to bed .
go back to bed ; it is n ’ t day .
is n ’ t tomorrow , boy , the propn of propn ?
i do n ’ t know , sir .
look at the calendar , and come back and tell me .
i will , sir .
the vapors , whizzing in the air give off so much light that i can read by them.— `` propn , you sleep .
wake up and see yourself .
wake up ! — `` such instigations have often been dropped where i have picked them up .
shall propn stand under one man 's awe ?
what , propn ?
my ancestors drove tarquin from the streets of propn when he was called a king.— `` speak , strike , revenge !
am i begged , then , to speak and strike ?
o propn , i promise you , if revenge follows , you will receive everything you ask for at the hand of propn !
propn , it ’ s the fifteenth day of propn .
good .
propn , it ’ s your brother , propn , at the door , who wants to see you .
is he alone ?
no , sir , there are more with him .
do you know them ?
no , sir , their hats are drawn over their ears , and half their faces are buried in their cloaks , so that i could n ’ t tell from their clothes or faces who any of them are .
they ’ re the rebels .— o conspiracy , propn on you for showing your dangerous eyes by night when evils are most free ?
o , then , by day where will you find a cavern dark enough to hide your monstrous face ?
do n ’ t find any , conspiracy ; hide it in smiles and friendliness , because , if you pass , your real face on , not even the dark place between propn and hell itself is dim enough to hide you from being stopped .
i think we are too bold to interrupt your sleep .
good morning , propn ; are we troubling you ?
do i know these men that come along with you ?
yes , every one of them , and every man here respects you , and every one wishes you had that opinion of yourself which every noble propn has for you .
this is propn .
he ’ s welcome here .
this , propn propn .
he ’ s welcome too .
this , propn ; this , propn , and this , propn propn .
they ’ re all welcome.— what worries are keeping you from sleeping ?
may i have a word with you ?
this direction is east .
does n ’ t the day break here ?
no .
o , pardon , sir , it does , and the gray lines over there that adorn the clouds are the messengers of dawn .
you ’ ll see that you ’ re both wrong .
here , where i point my sword , the propn rises , which is going a great way to the propn , bringing in spring .
some two months away , up higher toward the propn , he first shines , and the high propn propn , just as the propn , directly here .
let ’ s shake hands all over again , one by one .
and let ’ s swear our determination .
no , not an oath .
if not the face of men , the suffering of our souls , the waste of time— if these motives are weak , let ’ s break it off now , and every man go away to his lazy rest , let high - sighted tyranny range on until each man drops by chance .
but if these events , as i ’ m sure they do , bear fire enough to kindle cowards , and to harden the melting spirits of women with valor , then , countrymen , what do we need any other motivation except our own causeto prod us to revenge ?
what other bonds than secret propn , that have spoken the word , and will not negotiate without honor ?
and what other oath than honesty to honesty promised that this promise shall be , or we will die for it ?
swear priests and cowards , and deceitful men , old feeble dead bodies and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs ; swear to bad causes that such creatures as men doubt , but do n ’ t stain the even goodness of our undertaking , or the unsuppressed character of our spirits , to think that our cause and our performance propn oaths , when every drop of blood that every propn carries , and carries nobly , is guilty of causing the birth of several bastards , if he breaks the smallest particle of any promise that he has made .
but what about propn ?
shall we check him out ?
i think he ’ ll stand with us very strongly .
let ’ s not leave him out .
no , by no means .
it shall be said that his judgment ruled our hands ; our youths and wildness wo n ’ t appear at all , but all be buried in his seriousness .
then leave him out .
indeed , he ’ s not fit .
shall any other man be killed besides propn ?
our plan will seem too bloody , propn propn , to cut off the head , and then hack off the arms and legs , like anger in death and jealousy afterwards , because propn is but a limb of propn .
let ’ s be sacrificers , but not butchers , propn .
we all stand up against the spirit of propn , and , in the spirit of men , there is no blood .
o , that we could come by propn 's spirit then and not dismember propn !
but , alas , propn must bleed for it !
this shall label our purpose as necessary and not jealous , which appearing to be respectful to common eyes , we shall be called purgers , not murderers .
and for propn propn , do n ’ t think abut him , because he can do no more than propn 's arm can do when propn 's head is cut off .
i still fear him , because in the acquired love he bears to propn propn , good propn , do n ’ t think of him .
if he loves propn , all that he can do is what he can do to himself — think and die for propn .
and that ’ s as much he should do , because he ’ s given to sports , to wildness , and to having a lot of company .
the clock has struck three .
it ’ s time to leave .
but it is still doubtful whether propn will come out today or not , because he ’ s grown superstitious lately , quite a distance from the main opinion he once held about fantasy , dreams , and ceremonies .
it may be these apparent signs , the unaccustomed weather of this night , and persuasion of his men who tell the future may keep him from the propn today .
do n ’ t be afraid of that .
i ’ ll work on this , because i can give his state of mind true purpose , and i ’ ll bring him to the propn .
no , we ’ ll all be there to go get him .
by eight o ’ clock .
is that the latest ?
let that be the latest , and be on time .
propn propn does n ’ t like propn , who berated him for speaking well of propn .
i wonder why none of you ’ ve thought about him .
now , good propn , go ask him .
he likes me very well , and i have given him cause to ; just send him here , and i 'll train him .
the morning is coming .
we 'll leave you , propn and , friends , scatter yourselves , but all remember what you ’ ve said , and show yourselves to be true propn .
lucius ! —fast asleep ?
you have n ’ t got dreams or fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men .
propn , my lord !
propn , what are you doing ?
why are you up now ?
it is n ’ t healthy to expose your weak condition to the raw - cold morning like this .
not for you either .
i asked you again , then you scratched your head , and stamped your foot very impatiently .
still i insisted ; still you did n ’ t answer , but , with an angry wave of your hand , you gave me a sign to leave you .
so i did , fearing that i might make you more impatient when you seemed already fired up , and besides , i was hoping it was just a bad mood , which sometimes hits every man .
it wo n ’ t let you eat , or talk , or sleep ; and , if it could affect your face and body so much that it conquers your spirit , i should n ’ t know you , propn .
my dear lord , please tell me the cause of your grief .
i ’ m not feeling well , and that ’ s all .
propn is wise , and , if he were not in good health , he would do something about it .
why , i do .
good propn , go ahead to bed .
what , is propn sick , and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to challenge the evil diseases of the night , and tempt the thick and unclean air to add to his sickness ?
no , my propn ; you ’ ve got some sick worry on your mind , which , by the right and virtue of my place , i ought to know of , and , on my knees , i order you , by my once commended beauty , by all your vows of love , and that marriage vow which joined us and made us one , that you tell me , yourself , your half of me , why you ’ re so depressed , and what men have come to you tonight , because there have been some six or seven here , who hid their faces even from darkness .
do n ’ t kneel , gentle propn .
i should n ’ t need to , if you were acting like gentle propn .
inside the bond of marriage , tell me , propn , is my knowing secrets that appertain to you an exception to our vows ?
am i part of you but , as it were , in sort or limitation , — to keep you company at meals , sleep in your bed , and talk to you sometimes ?
do i only live outside of your good pleasure ?
if it ’ s no more than this , then propn is propn ' whore , not his wife .
you ’ re my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as are the red tears that visit my sad heart .
if this is true , then i should know this secret .
i ’ ll grant you that i ’ m a woman , but i am , besides , a woman that propn propn married .
i ’ ll grant you that i ’ m a woman , but i am , besides , a woman of good reputation , propn 's daughter .
do you think that i ’ m no stronger than my sex , being so fathered and so married ?
tell me your secrets , i wo n ’ t reveal them .
i have given you strong proof of my constancy , giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh .
can i suffer that with patience but not my husband 's secrets ?
o you gods , make me worthy of this noble wife !
listen , listen , someone is knocking .
propn , go in awhile , and by and by , your heart shall hear the secrets of my heart .
i ’ ll tell you all about my meetings , all the reasons for my sad brows .
leave me quickly .
propn , who 's knocking ?
here is a sick man that would speak with you .
allow a good morning from a feeble tongue .
i ’ m not sick , if propn have any exploit propn of the name of honor in hand .
i have such an exploit in hand , propn , that you would hear if you were n ’ t sick .
by all the gods that propn bow before , i here discard my sickness .
soul of propn !
brave son , fathered from honorable loins !
you , like an exorcist , have brought my dead propn back to life .
tell me to run now , and i ’ ll do impossible things , yes , and get the better of them .
what needs to be done ?
a piece of work that will make sick men well again .
but are n ’ t some well that we must make sick ?
that we must do that also .
what it is , my propn , i ’ ll tell you , as we are walking , as to whom it must be done .
start walking , and i ’ ll follow you with a new , fired up heart , to do i do n ’ t know what , but it ’ s enough that propn leads me on .
follow me then .
neither propn nor earth have been at peace tonight .
three times propn has cried out in her sleep , `` help , oh !
my lord ?
go tell the priests to do the sacrifice now , and bring me their opinions of success .
i will , my lord .
what do you mean , propn ?
do you intend to walk outside ?
you shall not go out of your house today .
propn , i never believed in omens , yet now they frighten me .
besides the things that we have heard and seen , there is a man inside recounting the most horrid sights seen by the guards .
a lioness has given birth in the streets ; and graves have opened up and given up their dead ; fierce fiery warriors fight on the clouds , in ranks and squadrons and right forms of war , which drizzled blood on the propn ; the noise of battle screaming into the air , horses neighed , and dying men groaned ; and ghosts shrieked and squealed around the streets .
what we avoid when the mighty gods dictate how things go ?
still , propn shall go out , because these predictions are not only for propn but also for the world in general .
cowards die many times before their deaths ; the valiant only taste of death once .
they say not to go out today .
looking at the guts of an offering , they could n ’ t find a heart inside the beast .
the gods do this in shame of cowardice .
propn should be a beast without a heart , if he stays at home today because he ’ s afraid .
no , propn shall not .
danger knows full well that propn is more dangerous than he .
alas , my lord , your wisdom is consumed in confidence !
do n ’ t go out today .
let me , on my knee , win this argument .
propn propn shall say i ’ m not well , and , to make you happy , i ’ ll stay home .
here 's propn propn , he shall tell them so .
propn , all hail !
good morning , worthy propn .
i come to go get you to the propn - propn .
and you ’ ve come at a very happy time to bear my greeting to the propn , and tell them that i ca n ’ t come today .
tell them so , propn .
say he ’ s sick .
propn propn send a lie ?
most mighty propn , let me know some reason , in case i ’ m laughed at when i tell them so .
but , for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i ’ ll let you know .
and these she interprets for warnings and portents and imminent evil , and on her knee , has begged me to stay home today .
your statue spouting blood in many pipes , in which so many smiling propn bathed , signifies that , from you , great propn shall suck reviving blood , and that great men shall ask for tinctures , stains , relics , and recognition .
this is what propn ’ s dream means .
and in this way , you have explained it very well .
i have , when you ’ ve heard what i can say and you know it now .
the propn has concluded to give a crown to mighty propn this day .
if you send them word you ’ ll not come , they may change their minds .
besides , it ’ s might be interpreted as silly , because someone says `` break up the propn until another time , when propn 's wife shall have better dreams .
pardon me , propn ; because my dear , dear love to your advancement bids me tell you this ; and reason is responsible to my love .
how foolish your fears seem now , propn !
i ’ m ashamed that i gave in to them .
give me my robe , because i ’ ll go .
and look where propn is coming to go get me .
good morning , propn .
propn , it ’ s eight o'clock .
i thank you for your pains and courtesy .
ask them prepare inside .
i ’ m to blame to be waited for like this.— now , propn ; — now , propn ; — what , propn !
remember that you call on me today ; be near me so that i may remember you .
propn , i will .
and so near will i be , that your best friends shall wish i had been further away .
good friends , go in , and taste some wine with me ; and we , like friends , will go ahead together straightaway .
that every “ like ” is n ’ t the same , o propn , that the heart of propn yearns to think about !
propn , beware of propn ; be careful of propn ; do n ’ t come near propn ; watch propn ; do n ’ t trust propn ; pay attention to propn propn ; propn propn does n ’ t love you ; you ’ ve sinned against propn propn .
there is only one mind in all these men , and it is bent against propn .
if you ’ re not immortal , look around you .
security gives way to conspiracy .
the mighty gods defend you !
boy , run to the propn - propn ; do n ’ t wait to answer me , but get going .
what are you waiting for ?
to know what my errand is , madam .
set a huge mountain between my heart and tongue !
i have a man 's mind , but a woman 's might .
propn , what should i do ?
run to the propn , and nothing else ?
and so return to you , and nothing else ?
i did n ’ t hear anything , madam .
please , listen well .
i heard a bustling rumor , like a riot , and the wind brings it from the propn .
really , madam , i hear nothing .
at mine own house , good lady .
what time is it ?
almost nine o ’ clock , lady .
has propn gone to the propn ?
propn , not yet .
i ’ m going ahead to get my spot to see him pass on his way to the propn .
you ’ ve got some petition to propn , have n ’ t you ?
that i have , lady .
if it will please propn to be so good to propn as to hear what i have to say , i shall beg him to take care of himself .
why , do you know if any harm 's intended towards him ?
none that i know definitely , but i ’ m very afraid there ’ s a chance .
good morning to you .— here the street is narrow .
the throng that follows propn at his heels , of propn , of propn , common suitors , will crowd a feeble man almost to death .
i 'll get me to a place with more space , and there speak to great propn as he comes along .
come back to me again , and bring me word about what he says to you .
the propn of propn are here .
yes , propn , but not gone .
propn , propn !
read this petition .
propn wants you to read this humble suit at your leisure .
o propn , read mine first , because mine 's a suit that touches propn nearer .
read it , great propn .
what concerns ourselves shall be the last thing considered .
do n ’ t delay , propn ; read it instantly .
what , is the fellow mad ?
servant , get away .
what , do you present your petitions in the street ?
come to the propn .
i wish your undertaking today may thrive .
what undertaking , propn ?
goodbye .
what did propn propn say ?
he wished that our undertaking today might thrive .
i ’ m afraid our plan has been discovered .
look , how he gets propn ’ s attention .
watch him .
if this is known , propn or propn shall never turn back , because i ’ ll kill myself .
cassius , stop worrying .
propn propn does n ’ t speak about our plan , because , look , he smiles , and propn does n ’ t notice anything .
propn when to act , because , look , propn , he ’ s taking propn propn out of the way .
where is propn propn ?
let him come , and now tell propn what it is that he wants .
he ’ s ready ; get closer and back him up .
propn , you ’ re the first one to strike .
are we all ready ?
what ’ s the problem that propn and his propn must fix ?
most high , most mighty , and most powerful propn , propn propn falls before you most humbly .
i must stop you , propn .
these lying down and these lowly courtesies might move ordinary men , and turn previous laws and the first decree into the laws of children .
do n ’ t be so silly as to think that propn has such rebel blood that will be changed by the same things that change fools ; i mean , sweet words , low , crooked curtsies , and playing up to me like a puppy .
your brother is banished by decree .
if you do bend , and pray , and play up to me for him , i reject you out of my way like a stray dog .
propn has never been wrong , only with good reason , and he will not be satisfied without good reason .
is there any voice more worthy than mine to speak more sweetly into great propn 's ear to ask for a repeal of my banished brother ’ s sentence ?
what , propn ?
cassius falls as low as your foot , to beg freedom for propn propn .
speak , hands , for me !
you too , propn then fall , propn !
propn !
freedom !
go ahead to the square , propn .
and propn too .
where 's propn ?
here , quite confused by this mutiny .
stand together solidly , for fear that some friend of propn 's should happen — do n ’ t talk about standing .— propn , good cheer !
we do n ’ t intend to harm you , or any other propn .
tell them so , propn .
and leave us , propn for fear that the people will attack us , doing some mischief to your old body .
do so ; — and let no man pay for this deed but we who did it .
where 's propn ?
fled to his house amazed .
men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run , as it were doomsday .
propn , tell us what comes next .
we know we shall die , we know ; it ’ s only time and drawing days out that men live on .
why , he that spends twenty years fearing death cuts twenty years off his life .
i agree , and then is death a benefit .
how many times will propn bleed in amusement , that lies now next to propn 's statue , no worthier than the dust !
so often as that shall be , so often shall the group of us be called the men that gave their country liberty .
what , shall we go ?
yes , every man away .
propn shall lead , and we will follow him with the most boldest and best hearts of propn .
wait , who ’ s coming here ?
a friend of propn 's .
if propn will guarantee that propn may safely come to him and is ready to tell how propn deserved to die , propn propn shall love propn living better than propn dead , and will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble propn with all true faith propn the hazards of this unconquered state .
that is what my master propn says .
your master is a wise and valiant roman ; i always thought so .
tell him , if it pleases him come to this place , he shall get an explanation and , by my honor , leave here safely .
i 'll go get him now .
i know that we shall have him as a friend .
i hope that we may , but my heart is still very much afraid of him , and my gut feeling is that he can not be trusted .
o mighty propn !
do you lie so low ?
do all your conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , propn down to this ?
if i ’ m going be killed , there is no time like propn 's death - hour , or any instrument half as worthy as your swords , decorated richly with the most noble blood in this whole world .
please , if you hate me , kill me now while your purpled hands smeared with fresh blood .
o antony , do n ’ t beg your death from us !
although we must appear bloody and cruel now , as you can see by our hands and this recent deed ; still you can only see our hands and this bleeding business they have done .
you do n ’ t see our hearts ; they ’ re full of pity ; propn the general injury of propn — as fire drives out fire , so pity drives out pity — has done this deed on propn .
for your part , our swords have leaden points to you , propn propn ; our arms in strength of friendship , and our hearts of brotherly disposition , receive you with all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
your voice shall be as strong as any man 's in giving out the new honorable offices .
only be patient until we have pacified the multitude , who are beside themselves with fear , and then we will tell you the reason why i , that loved propn when i struck him , have acted this way .
i do n ’ t doubt your wisdom .
let each man give me his bloody hand .
first , propn propn , i will shake with you ; — propn , propn propn , i take your hand ; — now , propn propn , yours ; — now yours , propn propn , propn ; — and , my valiant propn , propn though last , not least in love , yours , good propn .
gentlemen all — alas , what shall i say ?
if i had as many eyes as you ’ ve got wounds , weeping as fast as they let your blood out , it would suit me better than to close in terms of friendship with your enemies .
pardon me , propn !
propn propn propn me , propn propn .
the enemies of propn shall say all this ; then , in a friend , it is cold shame .
i do n ’ t blame you for praising propn so ; but what agreement do mean you to have with us ?
will you be counted in the number of our friends , or shall we go on and not depend on you ?
i shook your hands for that reason ; but i was really distracted from the point by looking down on propn .
i am friends with you all , and love you all , on this hope , that you shall give me reasons why and how propn was dangerous .
or else this was a savage spectacle .
our reasons are so full of good regard that were you , propn , the son of propn , you should be satisfied .
you shall do it , propn propn .
propn , a word with you .
i ’ ll go onto the platform first , and explain our propn 's death .
whatever propn shall speak , i ’ ll formerly declare that he speaks with our permission and that we are happy that propn shall have all true rights and lawful ceremonies .
it ’ ll be to our advantage more than doing us harm .
i do n ’ t know what may happen ; i do n ’ t like it .
propn propn , here , take propn 's body .
you shall not blame us in your funeral speech , but speak all the good that you can imagine about propn ; and say you do it by our permission ; or else you wo n ’ t have any part at all in his funeral .
and you shall speak after my speech is ended on the same platform where i ’ m going to be .
i do n ’ t desire any more .
prepare the body , then , and follow us .
o , forgive me , you bleeding piece of earth , that i ’ m meek and gentle with these butchers !
you ’ re the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times .
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
i do , propn propn .
propn wrote for him to come to propn .
passion , i see , is catching ; for my eyes , seeing those beads of sorrow stand in yours , began to tear .
is your master coming ?
he lies tonight within twenty - one miles of propn .
get back to him quickly speed , and tell him what has happened .
here is a mourning propn , a dangerous propn , a propn not safe for propn yet ; get going , and tell him so .
stay here for a bit ; you shall not go back until i have carried this corpse into the market place .
there i shall test , in my speech , how the people takethe cruel actions of these bloody men ; once i know that , you shall tell propn propn the state of things .
lend me your hand .
i ’ ll hear propn speak .
i ’ ll hear propn , and compare their reasons , once they have all been told .
the noble propn is on the platform .
silence !
please wait until i finish .
romans , countrymen , and friends !
listen to my cause , and be silent , so you can hear .
believe me based on my honor , and have respect for my honor , so you can believe .
judge me in your wisdom , and wake up your senses , so you can be a better judge .
if there is anyone in this assembly , any dear friend of propn 's , to him i say that propn ' love to propn was no less than his love .
if then that friend demands why propn rose against propn , this is my answer , — not that i loved propn less , but that i loved propn more .
would you rather propn were living , and you all die slaves , than that propn were dead , so you all live freemen ?
as propn loved me , i weep for him ; as he was fortunate , i rejoice at it ; as he was valiant , i honor him ; but , as he was ambitious , i killed him .
there are tears for his love ; joy for his fortune ; honor for his valor , and death for his ambition .
who is here so low thatthey would rather be a slave ?
if there are any , speak , because i have offended him .
who here is so rude that they would n ’ t be a propn ?
if there are any , speak , because i have offended him .
who is here so vile that he will not love his country ?
if there are any , speak , because i offended him .
i ’ ll stop so you can reply .
none , propn , none .
then i have offended none .
i have done no more to propn than you shall do to propn .
the question of his death is recorded on rolls in the propn , his glory not made thin , where he was worthy ; nor are his offenses recorded , for which he suffered death .
here comes his body , mourned by propn propn , who , although he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying , a place in the commonwealth , just as you all will .
with this , i leave — that , as i killed my best friend for the good of propn , i have the same dagger for myself , to be used when it shall please my country to need my death .
bring him home with triumph to his house .
give him a statue with his ancestors .
let him be propn .
propn 's better parts shall be crowned in propn .
we 'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
my countrymen , — peace !
silence !
propn speaks .
peace , oh !
good countrymen , let me leave alone , and , for my sake , stay here with propn .
propn propn 's corpse , and respect his speech about propn 's glory , which propn propn is allowed to make with our permission .
please , no man leave , except i alone , until propn has spoken .
for propn ' sake , i ’ m grateful to you .
what does he say about propn ?
he says , for propn ' sake , he finds himself grateful to us all .
it ’ s best that he does n ’ t speak harm about propn here .
this propn was a tyrant .
yes , that 's certain .
we are blessed that propn is rid of him .
peace !
let ’ s hear what propn can say .
you gentle propn propn , oh !
let ’ s hear him .
here , with the permission of propn and the rest , — because propn is an honorable man ; and they are all , all honorable men , — i come to speak in propn 's funeral .
propn brought many captives home to propn , whose ransoms filled the national treasury .
did this seem ambitious in propn ?
yet propn says he was ambitious ; and propn is an honorable man .
you all saw that , on the feast of the priest propn , i presented a kingly crown to him three times , which he refused three times .
was this ambition ?
yet propn says he was ambitious ; and , sure , he ’ s an honorable man .
i do n ’ t speak to disprove what propn spoke , but i ’ m here to speak what i know .
you all loved him once , — not without reason .
i think there is a lot of reason in what he ’ s saying .
if you rightly think about the matter , propn has had great wrong done to him .
has n ’ t he , gentlemen ?
i ’ m afraid that a worse man will take his place .
did you pay attention to his words ?
propn would n ’ t take the crown ; it ’ s certain he was n ’ t ambitious for that reason .
if it ’ s found to be so , someone will dearly pay for it .
here 's not a nobler man in propn than propn .
now watch him ; he begins to speak again .
only yesterday , the word of propn might have stood against the world .
now lies he there , and there is no one too poor to pay him respect .
i wo n ’ t do them wrong ; i would rather choose to wrong the dead , to wrong myself , and you , before i ’ ll wrong such honorable men .
but here 's a parchment with the seal of propn i found it in his bedroom , — it ’ s his will .
let only the common people hear this testament , — which , pardon me , i do n ’ t mean to read , — and they would go and kiss dead propn 's wounds , and dip their napkins in his sacred blood ; yes , beg a hair of him for memory , and , dying , mention that hair in their wills , leaving it as a rich legacy to their children .
we 'll hear the will .
read it , propn propn .
the will , the will !
we will hear propn 's will .
have patience , gentle friends , i must not read it ; it is n ’ t proper that you know how propn loved you .
you are n ’ t wood , you are n ’ t stones , you are men ; and , being men , hearing the will of propn , it will inflame you ; it will make you crazy .
it ’ s good that you do n ’ t know that you ’ re his heirs ; because if you did , o , what would happen !
read the will !
we 'll hear it , propn ; you shall read us the will , — propn 's will !
wo n ’ t you be patient ?
wo n ’ t you wait a minute ?
i went beyond what i was going to say to tell you about it .
i ’ m afraid i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed propn ; i really do fear it .
they were traitors .
the testament !
they were villains , murderers .
the will !
read the will !
you ’ ll force me , then , to read the will ?
then make a circle around the corpse of propn , and let me show you the man who made the will .
shall i come down ?
and will you give me permission ?
you shall have permission .
stand from the hearse , stand from the body .
room for antony ! —most noble propn !
no , do n ’ t press so close to me ; stand a bit away .
if you ’ ve got tears , get ready to shed them now .
you all know this cloak .
i remember the first time propn ever put it on ; it was on a summer 's evening , in his tent , that day he overcame propn .
propn , o you gods , how dearly propn loved him !
this was the most unkindest cut of all , because , when the noble propn saw propn stab him , propn , stronger than traitors ' arms , propn defeated him .
then his mighty heart burst , and , in his cloak covering up his face , even at the base of propn 's statue , which was covered in blood , great propn fell .
o , now you weep and i can see that you feel the blow of pity .
these tears are full of grace .
kind souls , what , do you weep when you only see our propn 's clothes wounded ?
look here , here he is , disfigured , as you can see , by traitors .
o piteous spectacle !
o noble propn !
o sad day !
o traitors , villains !
o most bloody sight !
revenge , — go , — find , — burn , — fire , — kill , — slay , — do n ’ t let a traitor live !
wait , countrymen .
peace there !
hear the noble propn .
we 'll hear him , we 'll follow him , we 'll die with him .
good friends , sweet friends , do n ’ t let me stir you up to such a sudden flood of rebellion .
they who have done this deed are honorable .
i did n ’ t come , friends , to steal away your hearts .
but if i were propn , and if propn were propn , there would be an propn to propn up your spirits , and put a tongue in every wound of propn , that would move the stones of propn to rise and rebel .
we 'll rebel .
we 'll burn the house of propn .
away , then !
come , find the conspirators .
but hear me , countrymen ; still hear me speak .
peace , oh !
hear antony ; most noble propn !
why , friends , you go ahead to do you do n ’ t know what .
where has propn deserved your loves like this ?
alas , you do n ’ t know ; i must tell you then .
you ’ ve forgotten the will i told you of .
here is the will , and under propn 's seal .
to every roman citizen he gives seventy - five dollars each .
o , royal propn !
hear me with patience .
peace , oh !
here was a propn !
when does another like him come ?
we 'll burn his body in the holy place , and we ’ ll set the traitors ' houses on fire with the torches .
pick up the body .
go , go get fire .
grab down benches .
grab down chairs , windows , anything .
now let it work .— propn , you ’ re working !
propn , propn has already come to propn .
where is he ?
he and propn are at propn 's house .
and i ’ ll go there straight to visit him .
he comes on a wish .
propn is merry , and in this mood will give us anything .
i heard them say propn and propn are riding like madmen through the gates of propn .
it ’ s likely they had some notice from the people , how i had moved them .
take me to propn .
i dreamt tonight that i feasted with propn , and unlucky things directed my imagination .
i do n ’ t want to go out of doors , yet something leads me there .
what is your name ?
where are you going ?
where do you live ?
are you a married man or a bachelor ?
answer every man directly .
yes , and briefly .
yes , and wisely .
yes , and truly ; you had better answer .
what is my name ?
where am i going ?
where do i live ?
am i a married man or a bachelor ?
go on ; directly .
directly , i ’ m going to propn 's funeral .
as a friend or an enemy ?
as a friend .
that matter is answered directly .
for your house , — briefly .
propn , i live by the propn .
your name , sir , truly .
truly , my name is propn .
i ’ m propn the poet ; i ’ m propn the poet .
tear him apart for his bad verses , tear him apart for his bad verses .
i ’ m not propn the conspirator .
tear him , tear him !
come ; brands , oh !
some go to decius ' house , and some to propn 's , some to propn ' .
away , go !
these many men then shall die ; their names are checked on the list .
i do consent , — propn him down , propn .
on the condition that propn shall not live , who is your nephew , propn propn .
he shall not live ; look , i condemn him with a check .
but , propn , go to propn 's house ; go get the will here , and we shall determine how to cut off some appointments in legacies .
what , shall i find you here ?
here , or at the propn .
this is a foolish man without merit , good to be sent on errands .
is it fitting that , with the world divided into three parts , he should be one of the three to share it ?
you thought so , and took his side when we decided who should die , in our black punishment and condemning to death .
and , although we lay these honors on this man , to ease ourselves of different , disgraceful burdens , he shall only carry them as the donkey carries gold , propn and sweating under the load , either led or driven , as we point the way ; and having brought our treasure where we choose , we then unload him and let him loose , like an unloaded donkey , to shake his ears and graze in the common fields .
you may do what you want to , but i say he 's a tried and valiant soldier .
so is my horse , propn , and for that , i appoint him keeper of the hay .
my horse is a creature that i teach to fight , to wind , to stop , to run directly on , his bodily motions ruled by my whims .
do n ’ t talk of him except as a property .
and now , propn , listen to great things .
let ’ s do so , because we are on trial , and surrounded by many enemies , and some that have smiles in their hearts , i ’ m afraid , are capable of millions of evil deeds .
stop , oh !
he ’ s close by , and propn has come to bring you greetings from his master .
how did he receive you , let me be convinced .
with courtesy and with respect enough , only not with such familiar instances , or with such free and friendly conversation , as he used to in the old days .
you ’ ve described a hot friend cooling off .
always note , propn , when love begins to sicken and decay , it uses a stiff , cold ritual .
there are no tricks in plain and simple trust , but hollow men , like horses very eager about something , make gallant show and promises of their spirit , but , when they are supposed to endure a spur that will make them propn , they are humbled , and , like false , worthless horses disappear from the fight .
is his army coming ?
propn gently ahead to meet him .
stand , oh !
stop , oh !
pass the word along .
stop !
stop !
stop !
most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
judge me , you gods !
do i wrong my enemies ?
and , if that ’ s not true , how should i wrong a brother ?
propn , this sober face of yours hides wrongs ; and when you do them— propn , please .
propn , ask our commanders to lead their men a little away from this place .
that you ’ ve wronged me shows in this action : you ’ ve condemned and punished propn propn for taking bribes from the propn here , and my letters , taking his side because i knew the man , were blown off .
you wronged yourself to write me letters in such a case .
in such a time as this , it is n ’ t fair that every silly offense should uphold his criticism .
let me tell you , propn , you yourself are much condemned for being greedy , to sell and advertise your offices to unworthy people for gold .
i ’ m greedy !
thank your stars that you ’ re propn that speaks this way , or , by the gods , this speech would be your last .
the name of propn honors this corruption , and , for that reason , punishment hides his head .
punishment !
remember propn , remember the fifteenth of propn ?
did n ’ t great propn bleed for justice 's sake ?
shall one of us who killed the most important man in all this world just to support robbers , — shall we now contaminate our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty positions of our great honors for so much trash as may be grabbed like this ?
i had rather be a dog , and howl the moon , than be such a propn .
propn , do n ’ t scold me , i wo n ’ t put up with it .
go ahead ; you are n ’ t , propn .
i am .
i say you are n ’ t .
away , skinny man !
is it possible ?
listen to me , because i will speak .
must i give way and room to your rash anger ?
shall i be afraid when a madman stares at me ?
o gods , you gods !
must i endure all this ?
all this ?
yes , more .
must i give in ?
must i watch you ?
must i stand and bend under your short - tempered mood ?
by the gods , you ’ ll eat the poison of your proud temper , even if it splits you , because , from this day on , i 'll use you for my entertainment , yes , for my laughter , when you ’ re spiteful .
has it come to this ?
for my own part , i ’ ll be glad to learn from more capable men .
you wrong me every way , you wrong me , propn .
i said , an elder soldier , not a better .
did i say `` better ?
if you did , i do n ’ t care .
when propn lived , he would n ’ t dare insult me like this .
peace , peace !
you would n ’ t have dared to tempt him so .
i would n ’ t dare ?
no .
what , not dare to tempt him ?
for your life , you would n ’ t have dared .
do n ’ t presume too much about my friendship ; i may do something that i ’ ll be sorry for .
you ’ ve done what you should be sorry for .
there is no terror , propn , in your threats , because i ’ m armed so strongly in honesty , that they pass by me as the idle wind which i do n ’ t respect .
i asked you for certain sums of gold , which you denied me ; — because i can not raise any money by dirty means .
was that rejection done like propn ?
should i have answered propn propn if he asked me ?
when propn propn grows so greedy as to engage his friend in such battles , be ready , gods , with all your thunderbolts , cut him into pieces !
i did n ’ t deny you .
you did .
i did n ’ t .
he was only a fool that brought my answer back .
propn has torn my heart .
a friend should tolerate his friend 's shortcomings , but propn makes mine greater than they are .
i do n ’ t , until you use them on me .
you ’ re not my friend .
i do n ’ t like your faults .
a friendly eye could never see such faults .
a flatterer 's would not , although they do appear as huge as high propn .
come , propn and young propn , come , revenge yourselves alone on propn , because propn is weary of the world , hated by a friend he loves ; threatened by his brother ; attacked like a slave ; all his faults noted , set in a note - book , learned and memorized by heart , to throw back into my face .
strike as you did at propn , because i know , when you hated him the worst , you loved him better than ever you loved propn .
put your dagger away .
be angry whenever you want to , it ’ ll have a purpose ; do whatever you want to , dishonor shall be a joke .
o propn , you ’ re connected to a lamb that carries anger as a match makes fire , who , very irritated , shows a hasty spark , and right away is cold again .
has propn lived to be only mirth and laughter to his propn , when sadness and ill - tempered blood aggravates him ?
when i spoke that , i was ill - tempered too .
do you confess so much ?
give me your hand .
and my heart too .
have n ’ t you got enough love to be patient with me , when that sudden mood which my mother gave me makes me forgetful ?
yes , propn , and , from here on in , when you ’ re over - aggressive with your propn , he 'll think your mother scolds , and leave you alone .
let me go in to see the generals .
there is some grudge between them ; it ’ s not proper that they are alone .
you shall not come to them .
nothing but death shall stop me .
for shame , you generals !
what are you thinking ?
love , and be friends as two such men should be , because i am older , i 'm sure , than you .
ha , ha !
how this sneering fault - finder rhymes so badly !
get out , servant ; rude fellow , go away !
be patient with him , propn ; it ’ s the way he is .
i 'll know his disposition when he knows the right time .
away , away , be gone !
propn and propn , ask the commanders to prepare to pitch tents for their troops tonight .
and immediately come yourselves and bring propn with you to us .
propn , a bowl of wine !
i did n ’ t think you could be so angry .
o propn , i ’ m sick because of many sorrows .
you do n ’ t use your knowledge effectively , if you give into unexpected evil events .
no man handles sorrow better .
propn is dead .
ha !
propn !
she ’ s dead .
impatient that i was gone , and upset that young propn with propn propn has made themselves so strong ; — because that news came with the news of her death ; — with all this , she became crazy , and , without her attendants present , swallowed fire .
and died from that ?
even from that .
o you immortal gods !
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
fill the cup , propn , until the wine overflows ; i ca n ’ t drink too much of propn ' friendship .
propn , are you gone ?
i have letters that say the same thing .
with what addition ?
that propn , propn , and propn have put to death an hundred senators by decrees of death and bills in defiance of the law .
cicero one !
no , propn .
and nothing in your letters was written about her ?
nothing , propn .
i think that ’ s strange .
why do you ask ?
did you hear anything about her in yours ?
no , my lord .
now , as you ’ re a roman , tell me the truth .
why , goodbye , propn .
we must die , propn .
i think that , since she must die once , i have the patience to endure it now .
even so great men should endure great losses .
i have as much of this skill as you , but still i could n ’ t bear such new like that .
well , let ’ s get to our work .
what do you think of marching to propn now ?
i do n ’ t think it ’ s a good idea .
your reason ?
good reasons must , of course , yield to better reasons .
the people between propn and this field are only our friends because we force them to , because they are unwilling to give us support .
the enemy , marching along with them , will increase their numbers with them , and propn refreshed , reinforced , and encouraged ; we shall cut him off from that advantage , if we face him at propn , with these people behind us .
listen to me me , good brother .
excuse me .
there is a tide in the affairs of men which , if taken at high tide , leads to good luck ; not taken , all the voyages of their lives are bound to end in shallows and in miseries .
we are now afloat on such a high tide , and we must take the opportunity when it presents itself , or lose our one lucky chance .
the deep of night has crept over our talk , and nature must obey necessity ; which we will put off with a little rest .
is there anything else to say ?
no more .
good night .
we will rise early tomorrow , and be on our way .
o my dear brother !
this was a bad beginning of the night .
never let such disagreements come between our souls !
do n ’ t let it , propn .
good night , good brother .
good night , propn propn .
where is your harp ?
here in the tent .
what , you speak drowsily .
poor knave , i do n ’ t blame you ; you ’ ve been wake up too long .
call propn and some others of my men ; i 'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
propn and propn !
calls my lord ?
please , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep ; i might wake you up in a little while about business to my brother propn .
please , we will stand here and wait for your instructions .
i was sure your lordship did n ’ t give it me .
be patient with me , good boy , i ’ m very forgetful .
can you keep your heavy eyes open awhile , and play a song or two on your harp ?
yes , my lord , if it pleases you .
it does , my boy .
i bother you too much , but you ’ re willing .
it is my duty , sir .
i should n ’ t make you do your duty past your strength ; i know young bloods look for time of rest .
i have already slept , my lord .
you did well , and you shall sleep again ; i ’ ll not keep you long .
if you nod , you ’ ll break your harp ; i 'll take it from you , and , good boy , good night .
let me see , let me see ; is n ’ t the page turned down where i left reading ?
here it is , i think .
how badly this candle burns !
i think it is the weakness of my eyes that sees this monstrous ghost .
are you some god , some angel , or some devil , that makes my blood cold and my hair to stand on end ?
tell what you are .
your evil spirit , propn .
why do you come ?
to tell you that you shall see me at propn .
well ; then i shall see you again ?
yes , at propn .
why , i ’ ll see you at propn , then .
now i feel better , you have vanished .
lucius ! —varro !
claudius !
the strings , my lord , are false .
my lord ?
were you dreaming , propn , that you cried out like that ?
my lord , i do n ’ t know that i did cry .
yes , you did .
did you see anything ?
nothing , my lord .
my lord ?
my lord ?
sirs , why did you cry out like that your sleep ?
did we , my lord ?
no , my lord , i saw nothing .
nor i , my lord .
i ’ ll do that , my lord .
now , propn , our prayers are answered .
you said the enemy would not come down , but keep the hills and upper regions .
turns out to be untrue ; their battles are nearby .
they mean to warn us here at propn , answering us before we demand answers of them .
nonsense , i ’ m in their hearts , and i know why they do it .
they could be content to go to other places , and come down with fearful bravery , thinking that by this face to impress our minds , they have courage ; but it ’ s not true .
prepare yourselves , generals .
the enemy comes on in a show full of noble daring ; their bloody sign of battle is hung out , and something has to be done immediately .
propn , lead your battle quietly on , on the left hand of the even field .
i will be on the right hand ; you keep to the left .
why do you cross me in this command ?
i do n ’ t cross you , but i will .
they stop and want to talk .
propn propn , shall we give sign of battle ?
no , propn , we will respond to their attack .
stay here ; the generals want to talk .
do n ’ t move until the signal .
words before blows .
is that the way it is , countrymen ?
not because we love words better , as you do .
good words are better than bad strokes , propn .
in your bad strokes , propn , you give good words .
witness the hole you made in propn 's heart , crying , `` long live !
not stingless too .
o , yes , and soundless too , because you ’ ve stolen their buzzing , propn , and very wisely threaten before you sting .
you showed your teeth like apes , and wagged your tails like hounds , and bowed like slaves , kissing propn 's feet ; while damned propn , like a wild dog , struck propn from behind on the neck .
come , come , the reason .
if arguing makes us sweat , the proof of it will turn to redder drops .
never , until propn 's thirty - three wounds are well avenged , or until another propn has added slaughter to the sword of traitors .
propn , you can not die by traitors ' hands , unless you bring them with you .
i hope so ; i was not born to die on propn ' sword .
o , if you were the noblest of your strain , young man , you could not die more honorably .
a peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honor , joined with a man in a mask and a party man !
propn propn , be still !
if you dare to fight today , come to the field ; if not , come when you ’ ve got stomachs .
why , now , blow wind , swell seas , and swim ships !
the storm is coming up , and everything is at stake .
oh , propn !
listen , may i have a word with you ?
my lord ?
propn , this is my birthday ; propn was born on this very day .
give me your hand , propn .
you be my witness that , against my will , as propn was , i am compelled to set all our liberties on one battle .
you know that i strongly held propn , and his opinion .
now i change my mind , and partly credit things that have been predicted .
coming from propn , two mighty eagles fell on our former ensign , and they perched there , gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands ; who were associated with us here in propn .
this morning , they have fled away and are gone ; and in their places , ravens , crows , and kites fly over our heads and look down on us as if we were sickly prey .
their shadows seem like a killing canopy under which our army lies , ready to surrender .
do n ’ t believe it .
i only believe part of it , because my spirit is fresh , and i am resolved to meet all perils very constantly .
even like that , propn .
now , most noble propn , the gods are friendly today , so that we may , propn in peace , increase our days to old age !
but , since the affairs of men still seem uncertain , let 's think about the worst that can happen .
if we lose this battle , then this is the very last time we shall speak together .
what are you determined to do then ?
even by the rule of that knowledge by which i blamed propn for his suicide— i do n ’ t know why , but i think it ’ s cowardly and vile to take your own life because of the fear of what might happen— arming myself with the patience to wait for the help of some high powers that govern us here below .
then , if we lose this battle , you ’ re contented to be led in triumph propn the streets of propn ?
no , propn , no .
for that reason , take our last , eternal goodbye .
forever , and forever , goodbye , propn !
if we do meet again , why , we ’ ll smile ; if not , why , then this parting was the right thing to do .
forever and forever goodbye , propn !
if we do meet again , we 'll smile indeed ; if not , it ’ s true this parting was the right thing to do .
why then , lead on .
o , that a man might know how today 's business ends before it comes !
away !
ride , ride , propn , ride , and give these bills to the legions on the other side .
let them start the battle immediately because i see only cold appearances in propn ' part of the army , and a sudden push will overthrow them .
ride , ride , propn .
let all the soldiers come down .
o , look , propn , look , the enemy flies !
i have turned enemy to my own .
this ensign of mine here was turning back ; i killed the coward and took it from him .
o propn , propn gave the word too early , who , having some advantage on propn , took it too eagerly .
his soldiers were destroyed while we are all surrounded by propn .
fly further off , my lord , fly further off ; propn propn is in your tents , my lord .
fly , for that reason , noble propn , fly far off .
this hill is far enough .— look , look , propn ; are those my tents on fire ?
they are , my lord .
propn , if you love me , propn my horse and hide your spurs in him , until he has brought you up to the troops over there and back here again that i may rest assured whether the troops over there are friend or enemy .
i ’ ll be here again , even with a thought .
o my lord !
what news ?
o , he dismounts too .
come here , servant .
in propn i took you prisoner ; and then i made you swear , since i saved your life , that whatever i asked you to do , you should attempt it .
come now , keep your oath ; now be a freeman , and , search this chest with this good sword , that ran through propn 's bowels .
propn shall run far from this country , where no propn shall ever notice him .
it is only change , propn , because propn is overthrown by noble propn ' power , as propn ' armies are by propn .
these tidings would comfort propn very well .
where did you leave him ?
all very upset , with propn his slave , on this hill .
is n ’ t that he who lies on the ground ?
he does n ’ t lie like the living .
o my heart !
is n ’ t that he ?
our day is gone ; come clouds , dews , and dangers ; our deeds are done !
lack of trust in my success has done this deed .
lack of trust in good success has done this deed .
o mistake , soon conceived , you never come to a happy birth , only kill the mother that had you !
what , propn !
where are you , propn ?
find him , propn , while i go ahead to meet the noble propn , thrusting this report into his ears .
i may say , thrusting it , because piercing steel and poison darts shall be as welcome to the ears of propn as the news of this sight .
did n ’ t i meet your friends ?
and did n ’ t they put this wreath of victory on my brows , and told me to give it you ?
did n ’ t you hear their shouts ?
alas , you ’ ve misunderstood everything !
but , wait , take this garland for your head .
come , propn ' sword , and find propn ' heart .
where , where , propn , does his body lie ?
behold , over there , and titinius ’ mourning it .
propn ' face is upward .
he ’ s slain .
o propn propn , you ’ re mighty yet !
your spirit walks abroad , and turns our swords into our own guts .
propn propn !
look whether he has crowned dead propn or not !
yet , countrymen , o , still hold up your heads !
what bastard does n ’ t ?
who will go with me ?
and i ’ m propn , propn propn ; propn , my country 's friend ; know me as propn !
o young and noble propn , are you down ?
why , now you die as bravely as propn , and may be honored , being propn 's son .
yield , or you die .
but i yield to die .
there is so much money if you ’ ll kill me now ; propn propn , and be honored in his death .
we must not .
a noble prisoner !
propn , oh !
tell propn , propn is taken .
i 'll tell the news .
where is he ?
propn , propn ; propn is safe enough .
when you do find him , or alive or dead , he ’ ll be found like propn , like himself .
this is n ’ t propn , friend , but , i assure you , a prize no less worthy .
keep this man safe , give him all kindness ; i would rather have such men as my friends than enemies .
go on , and see whether propn is alive or dead , and bring us word how everything happened to propn ' tent .
come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .
propn showed the torchlight , but , my lord , he did n ’ t come back .
he ’ s or taken or slain .
sit down , propn .
slaying is the word ; it is a deed that ’ s in style .
listen , propn .
what , i , my lord ?
no , not for all the world .
peace then !
i 'd rather kill myself .
listen , dardanius .
shall i do such a deed ?
o dardanius !
o propn !
what wicked request did propn make to you ?
to kill him , propn .
look , he meditates .
now that noble vessel is so full of grief , that it runs over , even from his eyes .
come here , good propn ; listen to a few words .
what do you say , my lord ?
i know i ’ m going to die .
not so , my lord .
no , i ’ m sure of it , propn .
propn propn , you know that we two went to school together ; even because that our love of old , please , hold my sword handle while i run into it .
that 's not a job for a friend , my lord .
i shall have glory by this losing day , more than propn and propn propn shall get by this evil conquest .
so , goodbye now , because propn ' tongue has almost ended his life 's story .
night hangs on my eyes ; my bones that have only labored to attain this hour want to rest .
fly , my lord , fly !
away !
you ’ re a fellow of a good respect ; your life has some smack of honor in it .
hold my sword , then , and turn away your face , while i run on it .
will you , propn ?
give me your hand first .
goodbye , my lord .
goodbye , good propn .
what man is that ?
yes , if propn will recommend me to you .
do so , good propn .
how did my master die , propn ?
i held the sword , and he ran into it .
propn , then take him to follow you , who did the latest service to my master .
this was the noblest propn of them all .
all the conspirators , except him , did that they did out of jealousy of great propn ; only he , in a general - honest thought and common good to all , made one of them .
when should the three of us meet again ?
in thunder , lightning , or in rain ?
when all the uproar is over , when the battle has been lost and won .
that will be before sunset .
where should we meet ?
upon the heath .
that ’ s where we ’ ll meet with propn .
the old toad is calling me .
in a minute !
beautiful is disgustingly filthy , and disgustingly filthy is beautiful .
let ’ s float through the fog and filthy air .
what man is that with blood all over him ?
from the looks of him , he can tell us the latest news of the revolt .
this is the sergeant who , like a good and hardy soldier , fought against my being taken prisoner .
propn , brave friend !
tell the king what you know about the battle when you left it .
the outcome was doubtful ; men fought like tired swimmers who cling together and wind up choking .
o valiant cousin !
worthy gentleman !
just as when the sun rises and shipwrecking storms and terrible thunder stop , so from that man , who seemed to bring comfort , propn got worse .
our captains , propn and propn , were not upset by this ?
yes ; as sparrows are by eagles , or the hare is by the lion .
whether they meant to bathe in fresh , bleeding wounds , or create another propn scene , i can not tell .
your words suit you as your wounds do ; they both tell of honor .
who ’ s this coming here ?
the worthy propn of propn .
he looks as though he ’ s in a great hurry !
he look should look that way with so many strange things to say .
propn save the king !
where have you come from , worthy baron ?
from propn , great king ; where the norwegian banners insult the sky and , like a fan , make our people cold .
great happiness !
then propn , norwegian king , wanted a treaty ; we would not agree to the burial of his men until he paid us , at propn propn 's island , ten thousand dollars to our general use .
that propn of propn shall no longer betray matters close to our heart .
order his death immediately , and , with the traitor ’ s former title , greet propn .
i 'll see it is done .
what the traitor has lost , noble propn has won .
where have you been , sister ?
killing pigs .
sister , where were you ?
a sailor 's wife had chestnuts in her lap , and munched , and munched , and munched .
give me , `` said i .
the fat , sloppy woman cries .
i 'll give you a wind for your sail .
you are kind .
and i will give you another one .
though his ship will not be lost , it will be tossed about on the rough ocean .
look what i have .
show me , show me .
a drum , a drum !
propn does come .
quiet !
the charm ’ s going to bring things to a head .
i have never seen a day that is so disgustingly filthy and beautiful .
how far is it to the town of propn ?
what are these things with shrunken skin and wild clothes , that do n ’ t look not like they live on earth , only are still on it ?
are you alive ?
or are you any thing that man may question ?
you seem to understand me , since you each are laying a scrawny finger upon your skinny lips .
you should be women , only since you have beards , i ca n ’ t say that you are women .
all hail , propn !
hail to you , propn of propn !
all hail , propn !
hail to you , propn of propn !
good sir , why are you startled , and seem afraid of things that sound so beautiful ?
in the name of truth , are you fantastic beings or indeed what you look like ?
you greet my noble partner with current grace and great predictions of having nobility and of the hope to be king , that he seems carried away as well .
only you do n ’ t speak to me .
if you can look into the future , and say what will happen , and what will not , then speak to me , who does n ’ t beg or is afraid of your favors or your hateful spells .
propn !
propn !
propn !
you will be less than propn , and much greater .
not as happy as propn , only still much happier .
your sons will be kings , even though you will not be king .
so all hail , propn and propn !
propn and propn , all hail !
wait , you incomplete speakers , tell me more .
by inheritance , i know i am propn of propn ; only how am i propn of propn ?
the propn of propn lives , a prosperous gentleman ; and for me to be king is beyond belief , no more than to be propn of propn .
or why you interrupt our journey on this blasted heath with such prophetic greeting ?
speak , i command you .
the earth has bubbles , as boiling water has , and these spirits are like that .
where did they vanished to ?
into the air ; and what seemed solid melted like breath into the wind .
i wish they had stayed !
are you sure we ’ re talking about what we ’ ve seen here ?
or have we eaten some plant root that makes us hallucinate ?
your children shall be kings .
you shall be king .
yes , in just those words .
who 's here ?
silenced with that story , and reviewing all the events of the day , he found you in the stout propn ’ s ranks , not afraid of what you did or the strange images of death .
the reports came in as thick as hail and every one of them sang your praises in your great defense of the kingdom , and poured such praises down before the propn .
we are sent from our royal master , to give you thanks ; only to bring you , announced , into his sight , not just pay you for your brave deeds .
and , for as the first installment of a greater honor , he ordered me , from him , to call you propn of propn .
i was also ordered to add , hail , most worthy baron , for the title of propn of propn is yours .
what , can the devil speak the truth ?
the propn of propn lives .
why do you address me by his name ?
the man who was the propn still lives , only lives that life which he deserves to lose under the death penalty .
i do n ’ t know whether he combined propn with those of propn , or aided the rebel with hidden help and supplies , or that with both he labored to overthrow his country 's government , only his treasons , punishable by death , confessed and proven , have caused his downfall .
aside .
the greatest hurdle is behind me .
thanks for your pains .
do n ’ t you hope your children shall be kings , when those things that gave the propn of propn to me promised no less to your children ?
that , my best friend , might still inflame you with passion for the crown , in addition to the title of the propn of propn .
aside .
aside .
this supernatural meeting ca n ’ t be bad , only it ca n ’ t be good either .
if it ’ s bad , why has it given me promise of success , that began with a truth ?
i am propn of propn .
if it ’ s good , why do i give in to that suggestion whose horrid image makes my hair stand on end , and makes my heart pound so hard they knock at my ribs , against my will to stay calm ?
look , how our partner 's in such deep thought .
aside .
if luck wants me to be king , luck may crown me without my doing anything at all .
aside .
let whatever ’ s going to happen , happen .
time and happiness can run through the roughest day .
propn propn , we are waiting for you .
kind gentlemen , every day i turn the page , your pains are registered where i can read them .
let ’ s go see the king .
let ’ s think about what has happened ; and , later , when we ’ ve had a chance to think , let ’ s about these things openly each to other .
very gladly .
until then , enough .
come , friends .
is the execution of propn carried out ?
have n ’ t those in charge of it returned yet ?
my king , they have n ’ t come back yet .
only i have spoke with someone who saw him die , and he reported that he confessed his treasons very frankly ; he begged your highness for pardon ; and he seemed very sorry .
nothing he did in his life became him so much like the leaving it ; he died as someone one who had studied his own death , to throw away the dearest thing he owned as it were a careless trifle .
o worthiest cousin !
the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me .
you are so far ahead that swiftest way of repaying is slow to overtake you .
i wish you had deserved less , then the greater proportion both of thanks and payment might have been my !
i can only say that you are due more than all of us can ever pay .
in doing the service and the loyalty i owe you , i am well paid .
welcome here .
i have begun to nurture your career , and will labor to make the most of yourself .
propn propn , who has deserved no less , and must not be known to have done less than propn , let me infold you in my arms and stop you to my heart .
if i grow here in your favor , the harvest is yours .
my generous welcomes , childishly cruel in being so perfect , seek to hide themselves in tears .
we will go from here to propn , and then we will bind us further to you .
my worthy propn !
aside .
i must fall down on that step , or jump over it , for it ’ s in my way .
true , worthy propn !
he is so full of courage , and his commendations are food for me , a banquet to me .
let ’ s go after the man propn has gone before us to bid us welcome .
they met me on the day we won the battle , and i have learned by the most perfect report that they have more in them than mortal knowledge .
when i burned in desire to question them further , they made themselves vanish into thin air .
only i ’ m afraid your nature ; it is too full of the milk of human kindness to a shortcut to power .
you could be great ; you are not without ambition , only without the drive should usually goes with it .
the king comes here tonight .
you ’ re crazy to say that !
is n ’ t your master with him ?
one of my friends traveled with him , who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more breath to deliver his message .
see to his needs ; he brings great news .
the raven himself is hoarse with croaking about the fatal entrance of propn under my castle walls .
come , you spirits that hear mortal thoughts , take away my womanhood ; and fill me , from my head to my toes , full of most terrible cruelty !
make my blood thick , stop up the ways remorse can get into and leave my body , that no feelings of guilt keep me from what i intend to do , or put guilt between the consequences and the deed !
come to my woman 's breasts , and make my milk poisonous , you murdering ministers , wherever in your blind shadows you wait on human mischief !
propn propn !
greater than both , by the all - hail hereafter !
your letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present , and i now feel the future in the instant .
my dearest love , propn comes here tonight .
and when does he leave ?
tomorrow , as he intends .
o , the sun shall never see that tomorrow !
your face , my baron , is like a book where men may read strange matters .
we ’ ll have to speak more .
the air smells light and sweet to our gentle senses .
the temple - haunting martlet , this bird of summer , approves this place by his loved dwelling places , that propn 's breath smells wooingly here .
i have observed that the air is delicate in areas where they frequently breed and visit .
see , see , our honored hostess !
the love that follows us sometimes is our trouble , which are still grateful for as love .
propn i will teach you how you shall bid propn to reward us for your pains , and thank us for your trouble .
all our service , if done twice in every point , and then done double , would be poor and single business to compete with those honors deep and broad that your majesty heaps upon our house .
for those of old , and the recent titles heaped on them , we remain your hermits .
where 's the propn of propn ?
only he rides well , and his great love of us , as sharp as his spur , has helped him to get to his home before us .
beautiful and noble hostess , we are your guests tonight .
your servants always have their necessities , themselves , and what they own , in elegance , to make their reckoning of accounts at your highness ' pleasure , still to return your own goods .
give me your hand ; take me to my host .
we love him highly , and shall continue our graces towards him .
with your permission , hostess .
if this deed were done when it is done , then it would be better if it were done quickly .
this balanced justice returns the ingredients of the gold cup we poisoned to our own lips .
he has almost finished supper .
why did you leave the dining hall ?
has he asked for me ?
do n ’ t you know he has ?
was the hope you dressed yourself in propn ?
did it go to sleep it off ?
and does it wake up now , hung over from what it so freely committed to ?
i will calculate your love from this time forward .
are you afraid to be the same man in reality as the one you wish to be ?
would you have the crown which you believe to be the ornament of life , and yet live like a coward in your own self - esteem , letting `` i should n ’ t `` wait for `` i would , `` like the poor cat in the proverb ?
pray you , peace !
i dare to do all that may become a man ; who dares to do more is not a man .
what beast was it , then , that made you tell me about this plan ?
when you “ dared ” to do it , then you were a man ; and , in order to be more than what you are , you would be so much more the man .
they have made themselves agree , and that agreement now does n ’ t agree with you .
if we should fail ?
we fail !
only dig deep for your courage , and we 'll not fail .
when propn is asleep , which should be soon since he is very tired from his day 's hard journey , i will go to his two chamberlains with wine and carousing so their memory , the guardian of the brain , will be a wisp of smoke , and the tired brain wo n ’ t be able to think clearly .
who will bear the guilt for our great slaughter ?
only give birth to male children , for your unconquered spirit should be passed on only to males .
wo n ’ t it be understood , when we have marked those sleepy two of his own chamber with blood , and used their very own daggers , that they have done it ?
how ’ s your night going , boy ?
the moon goes down at twelve .
i think it ’ s later than that , sir .
stop , take my sword .
you take that , too .
a serious calling lies on me like lead , and still i could n't sleep .
merciful powers , hold me back from the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to when we sleep !
give me my sword .
who 's there ?
a friend .
what , sir , not in bed yet ?
the king 's in bed .
being unprepared , our wishes became the servants to what we lacked , which has worked out very well .
all 's well .
whenever you like .
if you agree with my opinion , when it is time , it ’ ll be more honor for you .
good rest in the meantime !
go tell your mistress that , when my drink is ready , she should ring the bell .
get to bed .
is this a dagger which i see before me , the handle pointed toward my hand ?
come , let me clutch you .
i do n ’ t hold you , and yet i still see you !
are you , fatal vision , as insensitive to feeling as you are to sight ?
or are you only a dagger of the mind , a false creation , proceeding from the brain oppressed by heat ?
i still see you , in form as evident to my touch as the one i now draw .
you guide me on the way that i was going , and show me the instrument i was to use .
my eyes are made the fools of by the other senses , or else my eyes are worth all the rest .
i still see you , and i see great , large clots of blood on your blade , which were not there before .
sure and firm - set earth , do n ’ t hear my steps , which ever way they walk , for fear your very stones disclose my whereabouts , and take the current horror from the time , which now suits it .
while i threaten , he lives ; words give breath to the heat of deeds that are too cold .
i go , and it ’ s done ; the bell invites me .
do n ’ t hear it , propn , for it is a sorrowful omen of death that summons you to propn or to hell .
listen !
peace !
it was the owl that shrieked , the fatal bellman , that gives even the worst dispositions a good night .
the doors are open ; and the grooms , filled to excess , propn their duty with snores .
who 's there ?
what , hello !
the attempt , and not the deed , propn us .
listen !
if the propn had n ’ t resembled my father as he slept , i would ’ ve done it .
my husband !
i have done the deed .
did n ’ t you hear a noise ?
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
did n ’ t you speak ?
when ?
now .
as i came down ?
yes .
listen !
who ’ s in the second chamber ?
propn .
this is a sorry sight .
there are two in the same room .
only why could n ’ t i say , `` amen `` ?
i really needed blessing , and the `` amen `` stuck in my throat .
i heard a voice cry , `` sleep no more !
why , worthy baron , you weaken your noble strength to think about things in such a crazy way .
go get some water , and wash this filthy witness from your hands .
why did you bring these daggers from the room ?
they must lie there .
go carry them , and smear the sleepy guards with blood .
weak of purpose !
give me the daggers .
if he bleeds , i 'll smear the faces of the grooms with it , because it must seem that they are guilty .
who is that knocking ?
what ’ s wrong with me , that every noise makes me jump ?
what kind of hands are these ?
ha , they pluck out my eyes !
will all great propn 's ocean wash this blood propn from my hand ?
no , my hand will rather redden the many seas , making the green one red .
my hands are the same color as yours , only i would be ashamed to have such a white heart .
let ’ s go to our bedroom .
your fortitude has left you alone .
listen , more knocking .
get on your nightgown , in case we are called by chance and it shows us to be watchers .
do n ’ t be lost so badly in your thoughts .
to know my deed , it ’ s best not know myself .
i wish you could !
here 's loud knocking indeed !
if a man were answering the doors of hell , he would grow old turning the key .
propn , knock , knock .
who 's there , in the name of the propn ?
it must be a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of a large crop .
propn , knock !
who 's there , in the other devil 's name ?
truly , it must be a liar who could swear on both sides of the scale against either side , who committed treason enough for propn 's sake , yet could n ’ t lie to propn .
o , come in , liar .
propn , knock , knock !
who 's there ?
truly , it must be an english tailor sent here for skimping on the fabric for a pair of a french hose .
come in , tailor ; here you may roast your goose .
propn , knock .
never quiet !
what are you ?
but this place is too cold for hell .
i 'll be a devil - porter no further .
i had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire .
in a minute , in a minute !
i beg you , remember the porter .
was it so late , friend , before you went to bed , that you overslept ?
what three things does drink especially instigate ?
by propn , sir , nose - painting , sleep , and urine .
i believe drink gave you the lie last night .
that it did , sir , in the very throat of me ; only i paid him back for his lie ; and , i think , being too strong for him , though he knocked me off my feet a few times , i still made a joke to throw him off .
is your master awake yet ?
good morning , noble sir !
good morning to you both !
is the king awake yet , worthy baron ?
not yet .
i 'll bring you to him .
i know this is a joyful trouble to you , it is still only one .
the labor we delight in cures pain .
this is the door .
i 'll make so bold to call , because it is my limited service .
does the king leave here today ?
the night has been unruly .
it was a rough night .
i ca n ’ t remember there being another like it .
o horror , horror , horror !
tongue nor heart can not comprehend or name you !
what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter ?
confusion has now made his masterpiece !
most unholy murder has broken open the propn 's anointed temple , and then stolen the life of the building .
what are you saying ?
the life ?
mean you his majesty ?
approach the chamber , and destroy your sight with a new monster to turn you to stone .
propn , awake !
ring the alarms bell .
murder and treason !
propn and propn !
shake off this soft sleep , death 's disguise , and look on death itself !
go up , go up , and see the great destruction 's image !
propn !
banquo !
rise up as you would from your graves , and walk like spirits to see this horror !
what 's happened , that such a hideous trumpet calls to summon the sleepers of the house ?
speak , speak !
o propn , propn !
our royal master 's murdered !
woe , alas !
what , in our house ?
too cruel any where .
propn propn , i beg you , contradict yourself , and say it is not so .
what ’ s wrong ?
your royal father 's murdered .
o , by whom ?
o , i ’ m sorry i was so angry that i did kill them .
why did you it ?
who can be wise , amazed , temperate , and furious , loyal and neutral , in a moment ?
who could refrain , that had a heart to love , and in that heart courage to make his love known ?
help me here , hello !
look to the lady .
why do we stop talking , that most may claim we did this ?
what should we say her , where our fate , hidden in a very small carpenter ’ s hole , may rush up and seize us ?
nor our strong sorrow propn to be revealed .
and so do i .
so do we all .
what will you do ?
our separate journeys shall keep us both the safer .
this murderous arrow that 's been shot has not yet hit its target , and our safest way is to avoid the aim .
therefore , get to your horse , and let us not be too dainty in saying goodbye , but only sneak away .
there ’ s protection in the theft that steals itself when there 's no mercy left .
ah , good father , you see the heavens , troubled with man 's acting , threaten his bloody stage .
it ’ s unnatural , even like the deed that 's been done .
on propn last , a falcon , towering in her pride of place , was hawked at and killed by an owl that usually eats mice .
and propn 's horses , a thing most strange and certain , beautiful and swift , the darlings of their race , turned wild in nature , broke their stalls , flew out , rebelling against obeying their masters , as if they would make propn with mankind .
it is said they ate each other .
they did , to the amazement of my eyes , that saw it .
here comes the good propn .
how is the world going now , sir ?
why , do n ’ t you see it ?
is it known who did this more than bloody deed ?
those guards that propn has slain .
alas , the day !
what good could they claim ?
also against nature .
thriftless ambition , that will plunder your own life 's means !
then it is most likely that the crown will fall upon propn .
he is already named propn ; and gone to propn to be invested .
where is propn 's body ?
carried to propn creek , the sacred storehouse of his predecessors , and guardian of their bones .
will you be going to propn ?
no , cousin , i 'm going to propn .
well , i ’ ll there .
well , i hope you see things are done well there , adieu !
propn , father .
propn 's blessings go with you ; and with those that would make a good situation out of a bad one and friends of foes !
if they told the truth , as their speeches shine on you , propn , why , by the truths made good on you , might they not be my prophecies as well , and set up my hopes ?
but i ’ ll be quiet ; no more .
here 's our chief guest .
if he had been forgotten , it would have been a gap in our great feast , and unbecoming to us .
tonight we host a solemn supper , sir , and i 'll request your presence .
let your highness command me , to whom my duties are joined forever with a most unbreakable tie .
are you going riding you this afternoon ?
yes , my good lord .
we would have desired your good advice , which still has been both serious and favorable , in this day 's council , but we 'll do it tomorrow .
are you riding far ?
as far , my lord , as will fill up the time between this meeting and supper .
if my horse does n ’ t ride better , i must become a borrower of the night , for a dark hour or two .
do n ’ t forget to come to our feast .
my lord , i wo n ’ t .
we hear our bloody cousins are living in propn and in propn , not confessing their cruel murder of their father , only filling their hearers with strange lies .
but more of that tomorrow , when together with that matter , we will have political issues that need us jointly .
is fleance going with you ?
yes , my good lord .
it ’ s time we were going .
i wish your horses are swift and sure of foot , and so go on for your ride .
propn .
until then , propn be with you !
propn , a word with you .
are those men waiting for us ?
they are , my lord , outside the palace gate .
bring them before us .
to be king in this way is nothing , only to be safely king in this way matters .
our fears of propn propn deep , and there ’ s a lot to be afraid of in the royalty of his nature .
he has the courage to do a lot , and , in that unconquerable temper of his mind , he has a wisdom that guides his courage to act in safety .
if the prophecy is true , i have defiled my soul for propn 's sons ; i have murdered the gracious propn for them , put doubts and bitter feelings into my mind only for them , and i have given my soul to the common enemy of man , just to make them kings , the sons of propn kings !
rather than see that happen , come , propn , into the arena , and fight for me to the death !
who 's there ?
now go to the door , and stay there until we call .
was n ’ t it yesterday we spoke together ?
it was , so please your highness .
well then , now .
you know he was the one , in the times past , who held you back from promotion , and you thought it was our innocent self .
i did so , and i went even further , which is now the point of our second meeting .
are you so patient that you can let this go ?
are you such believers in the gospel that you would pray for this good man and for his children , the same man whose heavy hand has led you to death , and made your families beggars ?
we are men , my liege .
yes , you certainly could pass for men , in the same way that hounds , and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , curs , propn , water - rugs , and demi - wolves are all the names of dogs .
i am one , my liege , whom has been so angered by the vile blows and beatings of the world that i am reckless in what i would do to spite the world .
and i am another one , so weary with disasters , so unlucky , that i gamble my life on any chance i can get , either to make it better or end it .
both of you know propn was your enemy .
true , my lord .
and he ’ s mine too , and to a such bloody degree , that every minute of his being puts a big knot in my stomach ; and though i could sweep him from my sight with barefaced power , and bid my will guarantee it , i ca n ’ t do it , because certain friends that are both his and mine , whose loves i may not lose , would only protest his fall who i myself struck down .
and so it is that i ask see your assistance .
we shall , my lord , perform what you command us .
though our lives — your spirits shine through you .
i 'll come to you in a minute .
we are resolved , my lord .
i 'll call upon you in a minute .
stay within .
propn , your soul 's flight , if it finds propn , must find it tonight .
has propn gone from court ?
yes , madam , only to return again tonight .
tell the king that i wish to speak with him , for a few words .
propn , i will .
nothing ’ s ours , all 's been spent , where we got what we wanted , but without content .
it is safer to be what we destroy , rather than , by destruction , live in uncertain joy .
how are you , my lord !
why do you keep to yourself , making the worst imaginings your companions , thinking those thoughts which should indeed have died with the dead ones you ’ re thinking about ?
problems with no solutions should not be thought about .
what ’ s done is done .
only let the order of the universe be disrupted , both the real and spiritual worlds suffer , before we will eat our meal in fear , and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that wake us up nightly .
it ’ s better to be with the dead , whom we have sent to their peace to gain our peace , than to lie on a bed , torturing of the mind in a restless frenzy .
be bright and jovial among your guests tonight .
you must stop this .
o , my mind is full of scorpions , dear wife !
you know that propn and his son , propn , live .
only in them , nature 's copy is not eternal .
there 's comfort in that .
then , you be happy .
before the bat has flown his hidden flight , before black propn 's summons are heard , before the dung beetle , with his drowsy hums , rings the bell to end the night , there shall be done a deed of dreadful note .
what 's to be done ?
i do n ’ t want you to know , dearest sweetheart , until you can applaud the deed .
come , night that closes the eyes , propn the tender eye of pitiful day ; and , with your bloody and invisible hand , propn and tear to pieces that great deed which keeps me pale !
things that are bad make strong themselves by ill .
so , i beg you , go with me .
but who asked you to join us ?
propn .
he does n ’ t need our mistrust ; since he tells us our duties and the directions for what we have to do .
then stand with us .
there are still some streaks of day in the west .
listen !
i hear horses .
give us a light there , hello !
then it is he ; the rest that are nobles are already in the court .
he is cooling off his horses .
a light , a light !
it is he .
let ’ s do it .
there will be rain tonight .
let it come down .
o , treachery !
fly , good propn , fly , fly , fly !
you ’ ll get revenge later .
o slave !
who put out the light ?
we have lost best half of our attack .
well , let 's go , and tell propn how much we did .
to the first and the last , a hearty welcome .
thank you , your majesty .
we will mingle with these people , and play the humble host .
our hostess sits in her chair of state , but , when it ’ s time , we will require her welcome .
say it for me , sir , to all our friends , for my heart says they are welcome .
see , they greet you with their hearts ' thanks .
there 's blood upon your face .
then it ’ s propn 's .
it is better with you out here than he inside the hall .
is he dead ?
if you did it , you are without equal .
most royal sir , propn escaped .
yes , my good lord .
thanks for that .
there the grown serpent lies ; the worm that has fled has a nature that in time will breed venom , but he has no fangs now .
get going .
tomorrow we 'll speak among ourselves , again .
my royal lord , you do n ’ t give the toast .
a good dinner for guests is more like one that ’ s bought rather than given , if the host does n ’ t make frequent toasts .
with no toasts , you might as well stay home , because away from home , ceremony is the sauce to meat , getting together would be bare without it .
sweet remembrancer !
now , may good digestion follow your appetites , and health on both !
may it please your highness , sit .
his absence , sir , means he did n ’ t keep his promise .
will your highness please grace us with your royal company ?
the table 's full .
here is a place reserved , sir .
where ?
here , my good lord .
what upsets you , your highness ?
which one of you have done this ?
done what , my good lord ?
i beg you , stay seated .
the fit is momentary ; in a minute , he will again be well .
are you a man ?
yes , and a bold one , that has the courage to look on a sight which might shock the devil .
o , these outbursts and jerky shaking , impostors of true fear , would well become a woman 's story at a winter 's fire , confirmed by her grandmother .
shame on you !
why do you make such faces ?
when it ’ s all over , you only look at an empty stool .
i beg you , see there !
behold !
look !
propn !
what do you say ?
why , what do i care ?
if you can nod , speak too .
if mortuaries and our graves must send those that we bury back , our tombs shall be the stomachs of birds .
for shame , for shame !
this ghost is more strange than such a murder is .
my worthy lord , your noble friends are missing you .
i forgot .
do not muse at me , my most worthy friends .
i have a strange infirmity , which is nothing to those that know me .
come , love and health to all ; then i 'll sit down .
give me some wine , fill my cup full .
i drink to the general joy of the whole table , and to our dear friend propn , whom we miss .
would he were here !
to all , and to him we miss , and all to all .
and get out of my sight !
let the earth hide you !
think of this , good peers , only as a common occurrence .
what man has courage to do , i have courage to do .
or be alive again , and challenge me to fight you in the desert with your sword .
if i have the habit of shaking , then proclaim that i am the doll of a girl .
here , horrible shadow !
unreal mockery , here !
why , so ; since you ’ ve gone , i am a man again .
i beg you , sit still .
you have disrupted the fun , broken up a good party , with very admirable chaos .
can such things be , that can overcome us like a summer 's cloud , without puzzling us ?
you treat me like a stranger unlike my usual self , when i wonder now how you can behold such sights , and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks , when mine are blanched with fear .
what sights , my lord ?
only go at once .
good - night ; and better health attend his majesty !
a kind good - night to all !
stones have been known to move , and trees to speak .
what time is it ?
almost the middle of the night .
what do you think about propn ’ s refusing to be at our great bidding ?
did you invite him , sir ?
i was told so , but i will send .
there 's not one of them , except for his house i do n ’ t keep a bribed servant .
i will go tomorrow , ( and i will go early in the morning ) to the weird sisters .
they shall speak more , for now i am determined to know the worst by the worst means .
for my own good , all other problems will have to wait .
i am now so far stepped in blood that , if i do n ’ t wade in it any more , it does n ’ t matter if i am getting out of it or going over it .
i have strange things in my head that need to be figured out , which must be done quickly before others look at them closely .
you need to sleep .
come , we 'll get some sleep .
we are still only youngsters in what we ’ re doing .
why , how are you , propn ?
you look angry .
do n ’ t i have reason , hags that you are , propn and overbold ?
how dare you propn and traffic with propn in riddles and affairs of death ; and i , the mistress of your charms , the secret contriver of all harms , was never called to offer my part , or show the glory of our art ?
and , which is worse , all you have done has been only for a wayward son , spiteful and wrathful , who , as others do , loves for his own ends , not for you .
but you can make amends now .
get going , and , at the sunken place by the river propn , meet me in the morning .
there he will come to know his destiny .
provide your vessels and your spells , your charms , and everything else beside .
and that drop , distilled by magic tricks , shall raise such unnatural spirits , that , by the strength of their deception , shall add to his confusion .
he shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear his hopes above wisdom , grace , and fear .
and you all know , security is the major enemy of humans .
listen !
and the right valiant propn was out too late , whom , you may say , if it please you , was killed by propn , because propn fled .
men must not walk too late .
who can not think how monstrous it was for propn and for propn to kill their gracious father ?
damned fact !
how it grieved propn !
did n ’ t he , right away , in pious rage , kill the two delinquents that were the slaves of drink and in the thralls of sleep ?
was n ’ t that nobly done ?
yes , and wisely too ; because it would have angered any heart alive , to hear the men deny it .
so i say , he has put up with all things well , and i think that , if he had propn 's sons in his prison , as , if it please propn , he shall not , they should find what it meant to kill a father .
only , peace !
because from his bold words , and because he did n ’ t go to the tyrant 's feast , i hear , propn lives in disgrace .
propn , can you tell where he is ?
propn , propn ’ s son , from whom propn withholds his birthright , lives in the english court and is received by the most pious propn propn with such grace that the evil twist of fate takes nothing from his high respect .
and this report has so exasperated the king that he prepares for some attempt of war .
did he ask propn ?
some holy angel fly to the court of propn , and unfold his message before he comes so that a swift blessing may soon return to our country that suffers under a cursed hand !
i 'll send my prayers with him .
the cat with the streaked fur has meowed three times .
three times , and the hedgehog whined once .
toad , that has spent thirty one days and nights under cold stone , from whose sweat a sleeping venom was gotten , propn you first in the charmed pot !
double , double , toil and trouble ; fire , burn ; and caldron , bubble .
fillet of a snake that lived in a bog , in the caldron boil and bake ; propn of newt , and toe of frog , wool of bat , and tongue of dog , a black snake ’ s forked tongue , and its cousin ’ s sting , propn 's leg , and owlet 's wing , for a charm of powerful trouble , like a hell - broth , boil and bubble .
double , double , toil and trouble ; fire , burn ; and caldron , bubble .
scale of dragon , tooth of wolf , propn 's mummy , a gulf - like stomach , of the rough sea salt glisten , propn of poison hemlock dug up in the dark , propn of propn not baptized , propn bladder of goat , and slips of pine trees cut off the tree when the moon eclipsed , propn of propn , and propn 's lips , propn of a baby born dead delivered in a ditch by a prostitute , make the gruel thick and gooey .
also add a tiger 's guts , for the ingredients of our caldron .
double , double , toil and trouble ; fire , burn ; and caldron , bubble .
cool it with a baboon 's blood , then the charm is firm and good .
o , well done !
how now , you secret , black , and midnight hags !
what are you doing ?
a deed without a name .
though you untie the winds , and let them fight against the churches , though the roaring waves propn sailors and sink ships , though corn on the cob be torn from its stalks , and trees blown down , though castles topple on their guards ' heads , propn palaces and pyramids bend their heads to their foundations , though the treasure of nature 's buds tumble all together , even until destruction makes everything sick , answer the questions i ask you .
speak .
demand .
we 'll answer .
say , if you would rather hear it from our mouths , or from our masters ’ ?
pour in the blood of a female pig that has eaten her nine piglets , and throw it into the flame with fat that has dripped from a murderer 's gallows .
come , high or low ; yourself and duties skillfully show !
propn !
propn !
propn !
beware propn ; beware the propn of propn .
send me away .
enough .
whatever you are , for your good warning , thanks ; you have helped my fear with your music .
here ’ s another , more potent than the first .
propn !
propn !
propn !
if i had three ears , i 'd still hear you .
why should i be afraid of you ?
what is this that rises like the heirs of a king , and wears upon his baby brow the golden crown of a king ?
listen , but do n ’ t speak to it .
that will never be .
who can move the forest , bid the tree to walk away from his earth - bound root ?
sweet predictions , good !
propn 's head will never rise until the wood of propn rise , and our high - placed propn shall live until his dying day , the death of his own time and mortal custom .
do not ask to know any more .
i will be satisfied or shamed .
deny me this , and an eternal curse fall on you !
show !
show !
you are too like the spirit of propn .
down !
your crown burns my eyeballs .
filthy hags !
why do you show me this ?
a fourth !
come out of your sockets , eyes !
what , will the line stretch out to the crack of doom ?
another yet !
a seventh !
now i see it is true , because propn , with his hair matted with blood smiles upon me , and points at them for his .
yes , sir , all this is so .
only why propn propn in this way amazedly ?
come , sisters , let ’ s cheer him up , and show him the best of our delights .
i 'll charm the air to give a sound , while you perform your antic round ; that this great king may kindly say , our duties did his welcome pay .
where are they ?
gone ?
let this evil hour stand forever cursed in the calendar !
come in , who ever is out there !
what 's your grace 's will ?
did you see the weird sisters ?
no , my lord .
they did n ’ t come by you ?
no indeed , my lord .
let the air they ride on be infected and let all those that trust them be damned !
i heard the galloping of horse .
who was it that came by ?
it is two or three , my lord , that bring you word propn is fled to propn .
fled to propn !
yes , my good lord .
propn , you anticipate my dread deeds .
the flighty purpose never is understood unless the deed goes with it .
from this moment the very first wishes of my heart shall be the firs actions of my hand .
no boasting like a fool , this deed i 'll do before i change my mind .
come , bring me to where they are .
what had he done to make him fly the land ?
you must have patience , madam .
when our actions do not make us traitors , our fears do .
you do n ’ t know whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
wisdom !
to leave his wife , to leave his babes , his mansion , and his titles , in a place that he himself flies from ?
my dearest cousin , i beg you , have patience yourself .
your husband , is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows what to do in these times .
things at the worst will cease , or else return to the way they were before .
my pretty cousin , blessing upon you !
he has a father , and yet he 's fatherless .
i am so much a fool , that if i stayed longer , it would be my disgrace and your discomfort .
i leave you at once .
how will you live ?
as birds do , mother .
what , with worms and flies ?
with what i get , i mean , as they do .
poor bird !
you would never fear being caught or dying , the mistakes nor the tricks .
why should i , mother ?
poor birds do not fall down .
my father is not dead , is all you ’ re saying .
yes , he is dead .
how will you do for a father ?
no , how will you do for a husband ?
why , i can buy me twenty at any market .
then you 'll buy them to sell again .
you speak with all your wit , and yet , in faith , with wit enough for you .
was my father a traitor , mother ?
yes , that he was .
what is a traitor ?
why , one that swears and lies .
and are all traitors like that ?
everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged .
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
every one .
who must hang them ?
why , the honest men .
then the liars and swearers are fools , because there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them .
now , propn help you , poor monkey !
only how will you do for a father ?
poor prattler , how you talk !
bless you , beautiful dame !
you do n ’ t know me , but i know you though in your state of honor .
i know that some danger approaches you nearby .
if you will take a homely man 's advice , do n ’ t be found here , here , with your little ones .
propn preserve you !
i can not stay any longer .
where should i fly ?
i have done no harm .
only i remember now that i am in this earthly world , where to do harm is often praiseworthy , to do good sometime is a dangerous mistake .
where is your husband ?
i hope , in no place so unsanctified or shamed as where such as you may find him .
he 's a traitor .
you lie , you shag - haired villain !
what , you egg !
young child of treachery !
he has killed me , mother .
run away , i beg you !
let ’ s look for some desolate shade and there cry our hearts out .
let us rather stop the mortal sword quickly , and , like good men , propn over our down - fallen country .
each new morning , new widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows strike heaven on the face so that it echoes as if it felt propn ’ s pain , and yelled out like a sigh of sorrow .
what you have spoken may be so perhaps .
this tyrant , whose only name blisters our tongues , was once thought honest .
you have loved him well ; he has n ’ t touched you yet .
i am young , only something you may deserve of him through me , and wisdom to offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb to appease an angry god .
i am not treacherous .
but propn is .
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an charge by a king .
angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
though all things disgustingly filthy would look like grace , yet grace must still look that way .
i have lost my hopes .
perhaps even there , where i did find my doubts .
why did you leave wife and child in that rawness , those precious motives , those strong knots of love , without leave - taking ?
i beg you , do n ’ t let my jealousies be your dishonors , only my own safeties .
you may be rightly just , whatever i shall think .
propn , bleed , poor country !
great tyranny , lay your foundation solid , because goodness dare not challenge you !
wear your wrongs , the title is settled .
fare you well , lord .
i do not wish to be the villain that you may think , for the whole space that 's in the tyrant 's grasp and the rich propn to boot .
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke ; it weeps , it bleeds , and each new day , another gash is added to her wounds .
i also think that there would be hands uplifted in my defense , and here , from gracious propn , i have the offer of goodly thousands .
only , for all this , when i shall tread upon the tyrant 's head , or wear it on my sword , my poor country shall still have more vices than it had before , more suffer , and in more ways than ever before , by the man who shall succeed the king .
who would that be ?
it is myself , i mean , in whom i know all the particulars of vice are so grafted that , when they shall be opened , black propn will seem as pure as snow , and the poor state will respect him as a lamb , being compared with my unlimited evils .
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top propn .
i will grant you he is bloody , luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin that has a name .
only there 's no bottom , none , in my own evils .
your wives , your daughters , your matrons , and your maids , could not fill up the cistern of my lust , and my desire would overcome all international factions that did oppose my will .
propn propn than such an one like me to reign over propn .
only do n ’ t be afraid to take upon you what is yours .
you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , and yet seem cold , the time you may so deceive .
we have willing dames enough , so there can not be that vulture in you , to devour so many as will dedicate themselves to greatness , finding greatness so inclined .
with this there grows , in my most ill - composed affection , such a unbendable greed , that , if i were king , i should seize the nobles ’ lands , desire their jewels , and their houses , and my wanting to have more would be as a sauce to make me hunger more , that i should start propn quarrels against the good and loyal , destroying them for wealth .
this sin of greediness digs in deeper ; grows with a more dangerous root than summer - seeming lust ; and it has been the sword of our slain kings .
still , do n ’ t be afraid propn has harvests enough to satisfy you , of your very own .
all these are bearable , when weighed against other graces .
but i have none .
i have no knowledge of the king - becoming graces , such as justice , verity , temperance , stableness , bounty , perseverance , propn , lowliness , devotion , patience , courage , fortitude , but i only abound in the division of each several crime , acting it many ways .
no , if i had power , i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell , propn the universal peace , confuse all unity on earth .
o propn , propn !
if there is any one fit to govern , speak .
i am as i have spoken .
fit to govern !
no , not to live !
your royal father was a most sainted king , the queen that bore you , propn upon her knees than on her feet , died every day she lived .
fare - you - well !
these evils you repeat upon yourself have banished me from propn .
o my heart , your hope ends here !
propn , this noble passion , child of integrity , has wiped the black scruples from my soul , and reconciled my thoughts to your good truth and honor .
propn propn has sought to win me into his power by many of these thoughts , and modest wisdom keeps me from over - believing haste .
only propn above propn between you and me !
for even now i put myself to your direction , and take back my own detraction of myself ; here renounce the taints and blames i laid upon myself , as strangers to my nature .
i am still a virgin ; i have never gone back on my word , scarcely have wanted what was my own , at no time broke a promise , would not betray the devil to his fellow , and delight more in truth than life .
my first lie ever was these things i said about myself .
what i am , truly , is your and my poor country 's to command , where , indeed , before you came here , propn propn , with ten thousand warlike men already at a point , was coming to .
now we 'll fight together , and the chance of goodness will like our necessary quarrel !
why are you silent ?
such welcome and unwelcome things at once are hard to reconcile .
well , more in a minute .
is the king coming , i beg you ?
i thank you , doctor .
what 's the disease he means ?
it is called “ the evil , ” a most miraculous work in this good king , which often , since my stay in propn , i have seen him do .
with this strange virtue , he has a heavenly gift of prophecy , and various blessings hang about his throne , that say he is full of grace .
see , who comes here ?
my countryman , but i still do n ’ t know him .
my ever - gentle cousin , welcome here .
now i know him now .
good propn , soon we ’ ll remove the thing that makes us strangers !
propn , amen .
is the situation in propn the same ?
alas , poor country , almost afraid to know itself !
it can not be called our mother , only our grave .
where nothing , but who knows nothing , is once seen to smile , where sighs , and groans , and shrieks , that tear at the air , are made , not marked , where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy .
no one hardly asks who the dead man 's knell is for , and good men 's lives propn before the flowers in their caps , dying before the flowers show signs of sickness .
o , kinsman too nice , and yet too true !
what 's the newest grief ?
the news accuses the speaker ; each minute turns up a new one .
how is my wife ?
why , well .
and all my children ?
well too .
the tyrant has not taken action against them ?
no ; they were well at peace when i did leave them .
let it be their comfort that we are coming there .
i wish i could answer this comfort with a similar one !
but i have words that would be howled out into the desert air , where hearing should not catch them .
what concern are they ?
the general cause ?
or is it a grief owned entirely by one person ?
only a mind that 's honest could share some of this woe , although the main part propn to you alone .
do n ’ t let your ears hate what i ’ m going to say forever , which will hit them with the heaviest sound that they have ever heard .
your wife and babies savagely slaughtered .
to relate the details would be , on the numbers of these murdered deer , to add to your own death .
merciful heaven !
what , man !
give your sorrow words .
the grief that does not speak propn up softly in the heart , and bids it break .
my children too ?
wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
and i had to be away from home !
my wife killed too ?
i have said it .
be comforted .
let 's make us medicines of our great revenge , to cure this deadly grief .
he has no children .
all my pretty ones ?
did you say all ?
o hell - kite !
all ?
what , all my pretty chickens and their mother at one fell swoop ?
revenge it like a man .
i shall do so ; only i must also feel it as a man .
i can not only remember such things that were , that were most precious to me .
did propn look on and would not take their side ?
propn propn , they were all struck for you !
nothing that i am , not for their own sins , only for mine , propn slaughter on their souls .
propn rest them now !
let this act be the stone that sharpens your sword .
o , i could cry like a woman with my eyes , and brag with my tongue !
now you sound like a man .
come , let ’ s go to the king ; our power is ready ; the only thing is missing is our leaving .
propn is ready to fall , and the powers above show us the way .
i have watched two nights with you , but i can perceive no truth in your report .
when was it she last walked ?
since his majesty went into the field , i have seen her rise from her bed , throw her nightgown upon her , unlock her closet , take out paper , fold it , write upon it , read it , afterwards seal it , and again return to bed .
a great disturbance in nature , to receive at once the benefit of sleep , and do things as if awake .
in this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
that , sir , which i will not report about her .
you may to me , and it is most proper you should .
neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
look you , here she comes !
this is her very disguise , and , upon my life , fast asleep .
observe her ; stand close .
where did she get that light ?
why , it stood by her .
she has light by her continually ; it is her command .
you see , her eyes are open .
yes , only she does n ’ t see anything .
what ’ s she doing now ?
look how she rubs her hands .
she ’ s accustomed to it , to seem to washing her hands in this way .
i have known her continue in this way for a quarter of an hour .
still here 's a spot .
listen , she speaks .
i will set down what she says , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
out , damned spot !
out , i say !
one ; two ; why , then it is time to do it .
hell is murky !
for shame , my lord , for shame !
a soldier , and afeard ?
what need we fear who knows it , when none can call our power to account ?
yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him ?
do you mark that ?
the propn of propn had a wife ; where is she now ?
what , will these hands never be clean ?
no more of that , my lord , no more of that .
you mar all with this starting .
you have known what you should not .
she has spoken what she should not , i am sure of that .
propn knows what she has known .
here 's the smell of the blood still .
all the perfumes of propn will not sweeten this little hand .
oh , oh , oh !
what a sigh that is !
the heart is sorely perplexed .
i do n ’ t wish to have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
well , well , well , pray propn it be , sir .
this disease is beyond my practice .
yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
wash your hands , put on your nightgown ; look not so pale .
i tell you yet again , propn 's buried ; he can not come out on his grave .
even so ?
to bed , to bed ; there 's knocking at the gate .
come , come , come , come , give me your hand .
what ’ s done can not be undone .
to bed , to bed , to bed .
will she go now to bed ?
directly .
disgustingly filthy rumors are circulating .
propn , propn , forgive us all !
good - night , good doctor .
the english power is near , led on by propn , his uncle propn , and the good propn .
revenges burn in them , because their dear causes would excite a dead man to the flowing of blood and the grim alarm .
we ’ ll meet them near propn wood they are coming that way .
does any one know if propn be with his brother ?
there is propn 's son and many youths without beards which now propn they are beginning manhood .
what is the tyrant doing ?
he strongly fortifies great propn .
now he feels his title propn loose about him , like a giant 's robe upon a dwarfish thief .
who , then , shall blame him when his own vexed senses begin to recoil and attack , when all that is within him revolts against him ?
well , we march on , to give obedience where it is truly owed .
we give out the medicine for the sickly commonwealth , and with him we pour , into our country 's purge , each drop of us .
or so much as it needs , to revive the flower of royalty and drown the weeds .
we march towards propn .
do n ’ t bring me any more reports .
i wo n ’ t be afraid until propn wood remove to propn .
what about the boy propn ?
did n ’ t a woman give birth to him ?
the mind i think with and the courage i have propn never sag with doubt or shake with fear .
the devil damn you black , you cream - faced loon !
where did you get that cowardly look ?
soldiers , sir .
go prick your face and hide your fear in a red face , you lily - livered boy .
what soldiers , servant ?
death of your soul !
those linen cheeks of your are counselors to fear .
what soldiers , milk - face ?
the english force , so please you .
take your face out of here .
i am sick at heart , when i behold propn , i say ! - this attack will give me the throne forever or unseat me now .
i have lived long enough .
my way of life is fallen into the dry , withered yellow leaf , and the things which should accompany old age , propn , love , obedience , troops of friends , i think i ’ ll have , but , instead of them , i ’ ll have propn , not loud , only deep , mouth - honor , breath , which the poor heart would gladly deny , and dare not .
propn !
what 's your gracious pleasure ?
what other news ?
all is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
i 'll fight until my flesh is hacked from my bones .
give me my amour .
it is not needed yet .
i 'll put it on .
give me my amour .
how is your patient , doctor ?
not so sick , my lord , as she is troubled with a number of illusions , that keep her from resting .
cure her of that .
that ’ s where the patient must minister to himself .
throw medicine to the dogs , i 'll have none of it .
propn , send out .
doctor , the barons desert me .
come , sir , get going .
if you could , doctor , analyze the urine of my land , find her disease , and purge it to a sound and former health , i would praise you to the very echo , that should praise again .
you can do it , i say .
what rhubarb , senna , or other purgative drugs , would do keep these propn here healthy ?
have you heard of them ?
bring it after me .
i will not be afraid of death and ruin , until propn forest come to propn .
propn , i hope the days are near at hand that our homes will be safe .
we do n ’ t doubt it .
what wood is this before us ?
the wood of propn .
it shall be done .
we can only learn that the confident tyrant still stays in propn , and will put up with our settling down before it .
let a true evaluation of the military situation wait until we have won the battle .
speculation only tells about their unsure hopes ; only a certain outcome must settle which direction the war will take .
here let them lie until famine and the plague eat them up .
if they were not reinforced by those troops that should be ours , we might have met them boldly , beard to beard , and beat them backward where they came from .
what ’ s that noise ?
it is the cry of women , my good lord .
why was that cry ?
the queen , my lord , is dead .
out , out , brief candle !
life 's only a walking shadow ; a bad actor , that struts and worries about his hour onstage , and then is not heard from again .
it is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .
gracious my lord , i would report what i say i saw , only i do n ’ t know how to do it .
well , just say it , sir .
as i was standing my watch upon the hill , i looked toward propn , and in a minute , i thought , the wood began to move .
propn , and slave !
let me suffer your anger if it is n ’ t so .
within these three miles , you can see it coming , i say , a moving grove .
i reign in my resolution and begin to doubt the lie of the fiend that lies the same as telling the truth .
fear not , until propn wood do come to propn ; `` and now a wood comes toward propn .
arm , arm , and attack !
if this which he swears does appear , there is no flying from here or wasting time here .
i begin to be weary of the sun , and i wish the order the world were now destroyed .
ring the alarms bell !
blow , wind !
come , ruin !
at least we 'll die with armor on our back .
now that we ’ re near enough , throw the branch down , and look like the men you are .
fare you well .
if we only find the tyrant 's forces tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .
who is he that was not born of woman ?
such a one i am to fear , not anyone else .
what is your name ?
you ’ ll be afraid to hear it .
my name 's propn .
the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to my ear .
no , nor more fearful .
you lie , abhorred tyrant ; with my sword i 'll prove the lie you speak .
you were given birth by a woman .
but i smile at swords , laugh scornfully at weapons , brandished by man that 's been given birth by a woman .
the noise is that way .
propn , show your face !
if you are already slain and not by me , my wife and children 's ghosts will still haunt me .
let me find him , fortune !
and i will not beg for more .
this way , my lord ; the castle 's gently surrounded .
the tyrant 's people fight on both sides ; the noble barons fight bravely in the war ; the day almost professes itself to be yours , and little is to do .
we have met with foes that fight beside us .
enter the castle , sir .
why should i play the roman fool and die on my own sword ?
while i see living creatures , the gashes look better on them .
turn , hell - hound , turn !
of all men else i have avoided you .
you ’ re wasting your efforts .
lose hope of your charm ; and let the genius whom you still have served tell you , propn was from his mother 's womb delivered by caesarean section .
curse you for telling me that , because it has intimidated my better part of man !
and let these deceitful fiends be believed no more , that trick us with double meanings , that keep the word of promise to our ears , and break it to our hopes !
i will not fight with you .
then surrender , you coward , and live to be the center of attention of the times .
although propn wood did come to propn , and you against me , being given birth to by a woman , i will still fight to the end .
i throw my warlike shield before my body .
propn is missing and your noble son .
then he is dead ?
yes , and brought off the field .
your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth , because then it will have no end .
was he wounded on the front of his body ?
yes , on the front .
why then , he was propn 's soldier !
if i had as many sons as i have hairs , i would not wish them to a fairer death .
and , so his death bell is rung .
here comes newer comfort .
propn , here is the usurper 's cursed head .
we are free .
i see you surrounded by the finest nobles in the kingdom that speak my greetings by their thoughts , whose voices i want to hear loudly with mine : propn , propn of propn !
propn , propn of propn !
we shall not waste time before we make an accounting of your separate loves , and make us even with you .
my barons and relatives , from this point forward you are earls , the first that propn ever named to such an honor .
really , i do n ’ t know why i ’ m so sad ; it wearies me ; you say it wearies you ; but how i caught it , found it , or came by it , what it ’ s made of , where it started , i must find out ; and sadness makes me so crazy that i do n ’ t know who i am .
your mind is tossing on the ocean , where your ships , with full sails — like gentlemen and rich citizens on the water , or as if they were in a procession of the sea— look over the minor merchants , that bow to them , pay them respect , as they fly by them with their woven wings .
believe me , sir , if i had such venture out there , the better part of my thoughts would be with my hope of their safe arrival .
i ’ d be still plucking the grass to know where the wind blows , looking over maps for ports and piers and roads ; and every object that would make me afraid of propn to my ships , would make me sad without a doubt .
my breath , cooling my soup , would make me ill , when i thought about the damage a mighty wind might do at sea .
i should n ’ t see the time pass in the sands of an hour - glass but i ’ d be thinking about shallows and sandbars , and seeing my wealthy ship of war run aground , lowering her high top sails lower than her hull to sink .
even if i went to church and saw the holy building of stone , i ’ d be thinking right away about dangerous rocks , which , touching only my gentle vessel 's side , would scatter all her spices across the water , spreading my silk cargo across the roaring waters , and , in a word , one minute worth this amount of money , and now worth nothing .
if i had the mind to think about all this , and if i lacked the mind to see that such a thing could happen , would n ’ t it make me sad ?
but do n ’ t tell me ; i know propn is sad to think about his shipments .
believe me , no ; i thank my fortune for it , my cargos are not all loaded on one ship , or going to one place , and my whole estate is not based on the fortune of this present year ; so , my shipments do n ’ t make me sad .
not in love either ?
then let ’ s say you are sad because you are not happy ; and it ’ s easy to say that because you laugh and leap and say you are happy , because you are not sad .
now , looking at both sides , propn has made strange fellows in her time : some that will peep through their eyes forever , and laugh like parrots at a bag - piper , and the others of such sour disposition that they 'll never smile although a wise old man swears that the joke is funny .
i ’ d have stayed until i had made you happy , if worthier friends had n ’ t stopped me .
i appreciate your concern .
i see your own business needs you , and you take this opportunity to leave .
good morning , my good lords .
good gentlemen , when are we getting together ?
say when .
you ’ re turning into strangers ; has it come to that ?
we 'll wait until you ’ re free .
my propn propn , since you have found propn , we ’ ll leave you ; but , at dinnertime , please remember where we ’ re meeting .
i wo n ’ t forget .
i only think of the world as the world , propn ; a stage , where every man must play a part , and my part is a sad one .
ok , we ’ ll leave you then until dinnertime .
i must be one of these same dumb wise men , because propn never lets me speak .
well , keep me company for only two more years , and you ’ ll never know the sound of your own voice .
goodbye , i 'll be a better talker by dinner .
thanks , really , because silence is only commendable in a cow ’ s dried tongue , and in a girl who ’ s not for sale .
is that anything to think about now ?
well , tell me now about the lady , the one you swore to make a secret trip to , the one you promised to tell me about today ?
you know , propn , how much i have wasted my money by putting on a fancier appearance than my small funds could support ; i do n ’ t come to you now to ask that you forgive my debts , because my chief concern is to make good on these great debts which my behavior , sometimes reckless and wasteful , has left me broke .
to you , propn , i owe the most , in money and in friendship , and , from your friendship , i have a guarantee to get rid of all my plots and intentions as to how to get clear all the debts i owe .
please , good propn , tell me ; and if it is , honorable , as you yourself still are , be assured that my purse , my person , my utmost ability can be used for your benefit .
when i was in school , when i had lost one arrow , i shot another one of identical length in an identical way , with more thoughtful care , to find the one i lost , and by risking both , i often found both .
i owe you a lot , and , like a willful youth , i have lost what i owe you , but if you will please lend me money in the identical way that you lent me the first money , i do n ’ t doubt , as i ’ ll be more careful , to find both sums , or i ’ ll bring your second loan back again and just owe you thankfully for the first .
you know me well , and waste time here to twist a story about my friendship with examples ; and , no doubt , you insult me by questioning the limits of my friendship as if you had wasted everything i have .
you only have say to me what i should do that you think i can do , and i am committed to it ; so , ask me .
in propn , there is a rich heiress and she is beautiful and , more beautiful than that word , she has wonderful virtues .
the wide world is not ignorant of her worth , because the four winds blow in famous men who want to marry her from every coast , and her golden curls propn on her head like a golden fleece , which makes propn , her home , a rich island in a lake , and many sailors and heroes come to find her .
oh , my antonio !
if i only had the means to compete with one of them , i have a mind that predicts such good luck for me that i will undoubtedly be a very lucky one .
you know that all my funds are invested in ships at sea ; i do n ’ t have the money or goods to raise such a large sum ; so , go out , see what my credit in propn can do for you , propn that shall be stretched , even to the outer limits , to supply you for your trip to propn to beautiful propn .
go now and ask where money can be found , and i will too , and i will not object to borrowing it on my account or in my name .
honestly , propn , my little body is weary of this great world .
you would be , sweet madam , if your miseries were as abundant as your good fortunes are ; and yet , for all i see , they that are sick from over - eating are as sick as those that starve with nothing .
it ’ s not an insignificant happiness , therefore , to be well situated in regard to financial resources : having more than enough comes at some time or other to old men , but having a sufficient income lasts longer .
good sentences , and well said .
they would be better sentences , if you followed them well .
if knowing what to do were as easy as knowing what was good to do , chapels would have been churches , and poor men 's cottages would have been princes ' palaces .
it is a good prophet that follows his own instructions ; it ’ s easier for me to teach twenty people what was good to do than to be one of that twenty and follow my own teaching .
the brain may come up with laws to control society , but one hot temper jumps over a cold law ; propn the propn is just such a jumper , skipping over the nets of propn propn the propn .
but thinking this way is not the way to choose a husband for me .
your father was always a holy man , and holy men have good ideas when they die ; so the lottery that he has thought up in these three chests , made of gold , of silver , and of lead , by means of which whoever chooses the right chest chooses you , will , no doubt , never be chosen by the right man except the one you shall rightly love .
but what warmth is there in your affections towards any of these princes that have already come to try ?
yes , he ’ s a cunning fellow indeed , because he does n ’ t do a thing but talk about his horse ; and he makes it a great attribute to his own good qualities that he can shoe him himself ; i am very afraid , my lady , his mother had an affair with a blacksmith .
then there is the propn propn .
he does n ’ t do a thing but frown , as someone would say , “ if you will not have me , choose . ” he hears happy tales and does n ’ t smile : i ’ m afraid he will probably be the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of rude sadness in his youth .
i would rather be married to a skull with a bone in his mouth than to either of these princes .
propn defend me from these two !
what do you have to say about the french lord , propn propn propn ?
propn made him , and so let him pass for a man .
in truth , i know it is a sin to be a mocker , but him !
what do you say then about propn , the young baron of propn ?
you know i say nothing to him , because he does n ’ t understand me , and i do n ’ t understand him : he does n ’ t know propn , propn , or italian , and you will come into the court and swear that i only know a penny ’ s worth of propn .
how oddly he is dressed !
i think he bought his shirt in propn , his hose in propn , his hat in propn , and his behavior everywhere .
what do you think about the scottish lord , his neighbor ?
i think that he has neighborly charity in him , because he borrowed a moneybox from the propn , and swore he would pay him again when he was able ; i think the propn became his guarantor and it was sealed by another .
how do you like the young propn , the propn of propn 's nephew ?
very disgusting in the morning when he is sober , and most disgusting in the afternoon when he is drunk : when he is best , he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst , he is little better than a beast .
if he offers to choose , and chooses the right chest , you would be refusing to perform your father 's will , if you refused to accept him .
so , for fear of the worst , please set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the wrong chest ; because if the devil were within the chest and that temptation on top of it , i know he will choose it .
i will do anything , propn , before i ’ ll be married to a sponge .
you do n ’ t need to be afraid , lady , of having any of these lords ; they have told me their intentions , which is indeed to go back to their homes , and to trouble you with no more suits , unless you may be won by some other way than your father 's command , that getting you depends on the chests .
if i live to be as old as propn the witch , i ’ ll die as pure as propn the goddess of purity , unless i am obtained by the letter of my father 's will .
i am glad this batch of would - be husbands are so reasonable ; because there is n ’ t one of them that i am not foolishly in love with his very absence , and i pray propn grant them a fair departure .
do n ’ t you not remember , lady , in your father 's time , a propn , a scholar and a soldier , that came here in the company of the propn of propn ?
yes , yes , it was propn , i think , or so he was called .
true , madam ; he , that , of all the men that i have ever seen with my foolish eyes , was the most deserving of a beautiful lady .
i remember him well , and i remember him worthy of your praise .
how is it now !
what ’ s the news ?
the four strangers are looking for you , madam , to say their goodbyes , and there is a messenger come from a fifth , the propn of propn , who brings word the propn , his master , will be here tonight .
if i could welcome the fifth with as good a heart as i can bid the other four goodbye , i would be happy of his arrival ; if he has the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , i would rather he heard my confession than marry me .
come , propn .
three thousand dollars ; right ?
yes , sir , for three months .
for three months ; right ?
for which , as i told you , propn shall be obligated .
antonio shall be obligated ; right ?
will you help me ?
will you make me happy ?
can i know your answer ?
three thousand dollars , for three months , and propn obligated .
your answer to that .
antonio is a good man .
have you heard any suggestion to the contrary ?
but ships are only boards of wood , sailors only men ; there are land - rats and water rats , land - thieves and water - thieves , — i mean pirates , — and then there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks .
three thousand dollars - i think i may take his promise to pay .
be assured you may .
i ’ ll be assured that i may ; and , that i may be assured , i will think it over .
may i speak with propn ?
if it pleases you to dine with us .
yes , to smell pork ; to eat in the temple that your prophet , the propn , conjured the devil into .
this is propn propn .
he looks like a flattering tax collector !
i hate him because he is a propn ; but more , because , in his low simplicity , he lends out money free , and brings down the rate of interest with us here in propn .
if i can catch him once at a disadvantage , i ’ ll feed the ancient grudge i bear him until it ’ s fat .
he hates our sacred nation ; and he abuses me , even there where merchants congregate most of the time , insulting me , my bargains , and my well - won success , which he calls interest .
cursed be my tribe of propn if i forgive him !
propn , do you hear me ?
i am debating about my present monies , and , by the nearest guess , i remember that i can not instantly raise up the whole sum of three thousand dollars .
what about that ?
propn , a wealthy hebrew of my tribe , will supply me .
shylock , although i do n ’ t lend or borrow by taking or by giving excess money , still , to supply the urgent wants of my friend , i 'll break a custom .
yes , yes , three thousand dollars .
and for three months .
well then , your promise to pay ; and , let me see .
but listen , i thought you said you do n ’ t lend or borrow by charging interest .
i never charge interest .
did he charge interest ?
no , not charge interest ; not , as you would say , directly charge interest ; listen to what propn did .
when propn and he agreed that all the lambs which were streaked and multicolored should be given to propn , the ewes , being divided , were bred with the rams at the end of autumn ; and just when the rams and the ewes were in the act of procreation , the skilful shepherd peeled certain sticks , and , at the moment of mating , he stuck them up before the fat ewes , who , then conceiving , did in lambing time gave birth to multicolored lambs , and those were propn 's .
this was a way to thrive , and he was blest ; and good luck is blessing , if men do n ’ t steal it .
this was an enterprise , sir , that propn worked for ; a thing that was not in his power to bring to pass , but swayed and fashioned by the hand of propn .
are you telling me this to make interest good ?
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
i can not tell ; i make it breed as fast as ewes and rams .
pay attention , propn , the devil can cite scripture for his purpose .
an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek , a good apple rotten at the heart .
three thousand dollars ; it ’ s a good round sum .
three months from twelve ; then let me see the rate .
well , propn , shall we be indebted to you ?
propn propn , many times and often in the propn you have abused me about my monies and my interest rates ; i still have taken it with a patient shrug , because suffering is the badge of all our tribe ; you call me misbeliever , cut - throat dog , and spat on my jewish clothes , and all because of using of that which is my own .
well then , it now appears you need my help ; come on , then ; you come to me , and you say “ ' shylock , we would have money . ” you say so : you that spit on my beard , and kick me as you spurn a strange dog on your doorstep ; money is what you ask for .
what should i say to you ?
should n ’ t i say “ has a dog got money ?
why , look , how you get angry !
this was kindness ?
happily , in faith ; i 'll put my seal to such a promise to pay , and say there is much kindness in the propn .
you shall not put your seal to such a promise to pay for me ; i ’ d rather live in my poverty .
why , do n ’ t be afraid , man ; i wo n ’ t default in payment ; within the next two months , that 's a month before this promise to pay expires , i expect to get a return of three times three of the value of this promise to pay .
oh , father propn , what are these propn , whose own hard dealings teach them to suspect the thoughts of others .
please , tell me this ; if he should break his promise , what should i gain by taking his forfeit ?
a pound of man 's flesh , taken from a man , is not so valuable , or profitable either , as flesh of mutton , beef , or goat .
i say , to buy his good will , i extend this friendship ; if he will take it , okay ; if not , goodbye ; and , for my friendship , please do n ’ t insult me .
yes , propn , i ’ ll put my seal to this promise to pay .
then meet me immediately at the notary 's ; give him directions for confirming this happy promise to pay , and i ’ ll go and get the dollars right away , check on my house , left in the care of an unlucky rogue , and i ’ ll be with you soon .
hurry , gentle propn .
this hebrew will become a propn : he ’ s getting kind .
i do n ’ t like fair terms and a villain 's mind .
come on ; in this transaction , there can be no fear ; my ships come home a month before the due date .
do n ’ t dislike me for my complexion , the dark clothing of the polished sun , to whom i am a neighbor , and born near it .
bring me the fairest creature born in the north , where the sun ’ s fire hardly thaws the icicles , and let ’ s make a cut for your love to prove whose blood is reddest , his or mine .
in terms of choice , i am not only led by the nice direction of a maiden 's eyes ; besides , the lottery of my destiny does n ’ t give me the right to choose voluntarily ; but , if my father had not restricted me and controlled me by his wit , to give myself as his wife to the one who wins me by that means i told you , you yourself , renowned propn , would then stand as fair as any other man i have looked on yet for my affection .
i thank you , even for that : so , please , lead me to the chests so i may try my luck .
by this sword , — that killed the propn , a persian prince , that won three battles with propn propn i would out stare the angriest eyes that look , propn the most daring heart on the earth , propn the young , sucking cubs from their mother , yes , taunt the lion when he roars for prey , to win you , lady .
but , pity the time !
if propn and propn threw dice to decide who was the better man , the best throw propn be turned by luck to come from the weaker hand : so propn was beaten by his boy servant ; and i might too , with blind propn leading me , propn that treasure which a more unworthy man may get , and i ’ ll die from grieving .
you must take your chance , and either do n ’ t attempt to choose at all , or swear before you choose that , if you choose wrong , you will never to speak to me afterward about marriage ; so be advised .
first , forward to the temple : after dinner your choice shall be made .
to make me blessed or cursed among men !
certainly , my conscience will allow me to run from this propn my master .
the devil is at my elbow and tempts me , saying to me , “ propn , propn propn , good launcelot ” or “ good propn ” or “ good launcelot propn , use your legs , get going , run away . ” my conscience says , “ no ; be careful , honest launcelot , be careful , honest propn ” or , as i said before , “ honest launcelot propn , do n ’ t run ; scorn running with your heels . ” well , the most courageous devil tells me to pack .
go ! ” says the devil ; “ away ! ” says the devil .
propn young man , you , please ; which is the way to propn propn 's ?
oh , heavens !
this is my biological father , who , being more than half - blind , nearly stone blind , does n ’ t know me : i ’ ll try to confuse him .
propn young gentleman , please , which is the way to propn propn 's ?
turn up on your right hand at the next turning , but , at the next turning of all , on your left ; damn it , at the very next turning , turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the propn 's house .
be propn 's sonties , it will be a hard way to go .
can you tell me whether one launcelot , who lives with him , lives with him or not ?
are you talking about young propn launcelot ?
no master , sir , only a poor man 's son ; his father , although i say it , is an honest , exceedingly poor man , and , thank propn , well enough to live .
well , let his father be what he will be , we ’ re talking about young propn propn .
your worship 's friend , and propn , sir .
but please , therefore , old man , therefore , i beg you , are you talking about young propn launcelot ?
of propn , if it pleases you , sir .
propn it , propn forbid !
the boy was the very support of my age , my very prop .
do i look like a club or a beating stick , a staff or a prop ?
do n ’ t you know me , father ?
do n ’ t you know me , father ?
sorry , sir , i am half - blind ; i do n ’ t know you .
no , indeed , even if you had your eyes , you might not know me : it is a wise father that knows his own child .
please , sir , stand up ; i am sure you are not launcelot , my boy .
please , let 's have no more fooling about it , but give me your blessing ; i am propn , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be .
i can not think you are my son .
i do n ’ t know what i shall think of that ; but i am propn , the propn 's man , and i am sure propn your wife is my mother .
her name is propn , indeed : i 'll swear , if you are launcelot , you are my own flesh and blood .
you have got more hair on your chin than dobbin my thrill - horse has on his tail .
it should seem , then , that propn 's tail grows backward ; i am sure he had more hair on his tail than i have on my face when i last saw him .
how do you and your master get along ?
i have brought him a present .
how do you get along now ?
well , well ; but , as for me , as i have made up my mind to run away , so i ’ ll not rest until i have run some ground .
my master 's a very propn .
i am starving in his service ; you can count my ribs with your fingers .
here comes the man : give the present to him , father ; because i am a propn , if i serve the propn any longer .
you may do so ; but let it be quickly so that supper is ready by five of the clock at the latest .
see these letters are delivered , get the servants ’ clothes made , and ask propn to come now to my house .
to him , father .
propn bless you , sir !
propn have mercy , what do you want with me ?
here is my son , sir , a poor boy— not a poor boy , sir , but the rich propn 's man , that would , sir , — as my father shall specify— he has a great infection , sir , as one would say , to serve— indeed the short and the long is , i serve the propn , and have a desire , as my father shall specify— his master and he , propn save you , sir , are almost like cousins— to be brief , the very truth is that the propn , having done me wrong , causes me , — as my father , being i hope an old man , shall frutify to you— i have here a dish of doves that i wish to give you , sir ; and what i want is— in very brief , what he asks is impertinent to myself , as you , sir , shall know from this honest old man ; and , though i say it , though old man , yet poor man , my father .
one of you speak for both of you .
that is the very defect of the matter , sir .
the old proverb is very well parted between my master propn and you , sir : you have the grace of propn , sir , and he has enough .
you speak well .
well ; if any man in propn has a better table that offers to swear on a book , i shall have good luck .
and then to escape drowning three times , and to be in fear for my life with the edge of a feather bed ; here are simple escapes .
well , if propn is a woman , she 's a good woman for this guy .
propn , come ; i 'll take my leave of the propn in the twinkling of an eye .
you have my best efforts to get everything done as you ask .
where 's your master ?
over there , sir , he ’ s walking .
propn propn propn !
i have to ask you something .
you ’ ve got it .
propn propn , listen to me : if i do n ’ t put on a sober habit , talk with respect , and swear only now and then , wear prayer - books in my pocket , look demurely , no more , while grace is saying , hood my eyes like this with my hat , and sigh , and say “ amen ; ” use all the observances of manners , as one well studied in a sad display in order to please his grandmother , never trust me anymore .
well , we ’ ll see your behavior .
no , but tonight is an exception ; you shall not judge me by what we do tonight .
no , that would be a pity ; i would beg you rather to put on your boldest face of happiness , because we have friends that offer merriment .
but goodbye ; i have some business to see to .
and i must go to propn and the rest ; but we ’ ll visit you at suppertime .
i am sorry that you will leave my father like this : our house is hell , and you , a happy devil , robbed it of some taste of boredom .
tears exhibit my voice .
most beautiful pagan , most sweet propn !
if a propn does n ’ t play the rogue and get you , i am much deceived .
but , goodbye !
these foolish drops drown my manly spirit somewhat ; goodbye !
goodbye , good launcelot .
it ’ s a pity , what hateful sin it is in me to be ashamed to be my father 's child !
if you keep your promise , i shall end this strife , become a propn and your loving wife .
no , we ’ ll slink away at suppertime , disguise ourselves at my house , and return all in an hour .
we have n ’ t made a good preparation .
we have n ’ t spoken about the torchbearers yet .
it ’ s nasty , unless they may be skillfully ordered , and i think it ’ s better not to be undertaken .
if you will please break this up , it will become clear .
i know the hand ; in faith , it ’ s a beautiful hand , and the beautiful hand that wrote it is whiter than the paper it ’ s written on .
love news , in faith .
excuse me , sir .
where are you going ?
propn it , sir , to bid my old master , the propn , to come to supper tonight with my new master , the propn .
i have a torchbearer .
yes , damn it , i 'll be taking care of it right away .
and so will i .
meet me and propn at propn 's house in about an hour .
okay .
was n ’ t that letter from beautiful propn ?
i must tell you everything .
she has made a plan of how i shall take her from her father 's house ; what gold and jewels she has ; what boy 's suit she has ready .
if the propn her father ever comes to propn , it will be for his gentle daughter 's sake ; and never should misfortune dare to cross her foot , unless she does it under this excuse , that she is daughter to a faithless propn .
come , go with me , read this over as you go ; propn propn shall be my torchbearer .
quickly , quickly , please , draw the curtain right away ; the propn of propn has taken his oath , and comes to make his choice now .
propn , the chests stand there , noble prince : if you choose the one that i am contained in , our marriage vows will be solemnized right away ; but if you fail , my lord , you must be gone from here immediately without any more talking .
i am required by oath to observe three things : first , never to tell anyone which chest i chose ; next , if i fail to choose the right chest , i will never court a maid to marry for my whole life ; lastly , if i do fail in choosing the right chest , i will leave you immediately and be gone .
everyone swears to these conditions who come to take a chance for my worthless self .
what says the golden chest ?
ha !
let me see : “ who chooses me shall gain what many men desire . ” what many men desire !
that “ many ” may mean the foolish multitudes , that choose by outward appearance , not learning any more than their loving eyes teach , which does n ’ t go to the inside but , like the marten , propn on the outside wall in any weather , even in the force of wind and on the road to ruin .
i will not choose what many men desire , because i will not jump with common spirits and rank myself with the barbarous multitudes .
that fortunes , degrees , and offices were not earned by corruption , and that clear honors were purchased by the merit of the wearer !
well , to my choice : “ who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves . ” i will assume i am deserving .
give me a key for this , and instantly unlock my fortunes here .
that ’ s too long a pause over what you find there .
what 's here ?
the portrait of a blinking idiot , presenting me a piece of paper !
i will read it .
this does n ’ t look very much like propn !
is that my prize ?
is my deserving no better than that ?
to insult and judge are different things , and of opposite natures .
what is this here ?
sweetheart , goodbye !
i 'll keep my oath , patiently to deal with my anger .
in this way , the candle has burned the moth .
oh , these deliberate fools !
when they choose , they have the wisdom to lose by their senses .
where is my lady ?
i ’ m here ; what do you want ?
no more , please ; i am half afraid you will now say he is related to you , you spend such so many words in praising him .
come , come , propn , because i long to see propn propn 's messenger that comes so politely .
propn , propn propn , if it is your will !
well , you shall see ; your eyes shall be your judge , the difference of old propn and bassanio : — what , propn wo n ’ t eat like a glutton , as you have done with me ; — what , propn and sleep and snore , and tear clothes apart— why , propn , i say !
why , propn !
who called for you ?
i did n ’ t call for you .
you , sir , always told me i could n ’ t do anything without bidding .
did you call ?
what is it ?
i am very reluctant to go ; there is some ill disturbing my rest , because i dreamt of moneybags tonight .
please , sir , go : my young master expects your insult .
so i expect his .
and they have conspired together ; i ’ ll not say you shall see a party , but if you do , then it was not for nothing that my nose started bleeding on last propn propn at six o'clock in the morning , falling out that year on propn - propn was four years in the afternoon .
what !
are there parties ?
listen to me , propn : lock up my doors , and when you hear the drum , and the vile squealing of the long - necked pipe , do n ’ t run up to the windows then , or thrust your head into the public street to gaze on christian fools with varnished masks ; but stop my house 's ears- i mean my windows ; do n ’ t let the sound of shallow foolishness enter my sober house .
what says that fool of propn 's offspring , huh ?
his words were , “ propn , mistress , ” nothing else .
goodbye ; and , if my fortune is not crossed , i have lost a father , and you a daughter .
this is the house where propn wanted us to wait .
he ’ s almost late .
and it ’ s a wonder that he ’ s late , because lovers always keep ahead of the clock .
that ’ s true : who gets up from a feast with the same hunger that he had when he sat down ?
where is the horse that retraces his boring steps again with the same fire that he walked them in the first place ?
all things that exist are sought for with more spirit than the spirit to enjoy them .
how the sailing ship leaves her native port like a youngster or a spendthrift propn and embraced by the prostitute wind !
how she returns like the spendthrift , with weather - beaten sides and ragged sails , propn , torn , and destitute by the prostitute wind !
here comes lorenzo ; more about this later .
sweet friends , i ’ m sorry i ’ m late ; not i , but my affairs , have made you wait : when you are ready to do anything to get wives , i 'll watch as long for you then .
who 's in there ?
who are you ?
tell me , just to be sure , even though i 'll swear that i know your voice .
lorenzo , and your love .
lorenzo , to be sure and my love indeed , because who do love i so much ?
and now , who knows but you , propn , whether i am yours ?
propn and your thoughts are witnesses that you are .
here , catch this chest ; it is worth the trouble .
i am glad it ’ s night so that you ca n ’ t see me , because i am very ashamed of my costume ; but love is blind , and lovers can not see the pretty mischief that they themselves commit , because , if they could , propn himself would blush to see me transformed to a boy like this .
go down , because you must be carry my torch .
they in themselves , to tell the truth , are as light as a flute .
why , light is a function of discovering things , love , and i should be hidden .
and you are hidden , sweetheart , even in the lovely garments of a boy .
but come at once , because the night is running away , and we are waited for at propn 's feast .
i ’ ll secure the doors , and cover myself with some more dollars , and i ’ ll be with you right away .
now , i swear , she is a propn and no propn .
curse me , but i love her heartily ; because she is wise , if i can judge her , and she is beautiful , if my eyes can really see , and she is true , as she has proved herself ; and so , like herself , wise , beautiful , and true , she shall be placed in my faithful soul .
who 's there ?
propn propn !
where are all the rest ?
i am glad about it : i do n ’ t want anything more than to get sailing and be gone tonight .
one of them contains my picture , prince ; if you choose that , then i am yours as well .
some god direct my judgment !
let me see ; i ’ ll look over the inscriptions again .
for lead ?
gamble for lead !
this chest threatens ; men that gamble everything do it in hope of a better advantage : a golden mind does n ’ t stoop to shows of scum ; then i wo n ’ t give or gamble anything for lead .
what does the silver say , with her virgin color ?
who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves . ” as much as he deserves !
what if i did n ’ t go any farther , and chose right here ?
one of these three chests contains her heavenly picture .
is it likely that the lead one holds her picture ?
it ’ s damnation to think such a low thought ; it ’ s too gross even to be used as her shroud in the obscure grave .
or shall i think she 's enclosed in the walls of this silver one , being worth ten times less than traditional gold ?
oh , sinful thought !
there never was so rich a gem set in something worse than gold .
there , take it , prince , and if my picture lies there , then i am yours .
oh , hell !
what have we here ?
a skull , whose empty eye has a written scroll in it !
i 'll read the writing .
everything that glitters is not gold , often have you heard that told ; many a man has sold his life just to look at my outside : gilded tombs wrap around worms .
why , man , i saw propn sailing away ; propn has gone along with him ; and i am sure propn is not on their ship .
the law !
my dollars and my daughter !
a sealed bag , two sealed bags of dollars , of double dollars , stolen from me by my daughter !
find the girl !
you ’ d better tell propn what you heard ; still , do n ’ t tell him without warning because it may be too painful .
a kinder gentleman does not walk on the earth .
he answered ' do n ’ t hurry back ; do n ’ t be careless with business for my sake , propn , but wait until your plans are realized ; and for the propn 's promise to pay which he has from me , do n ’ t let it enter your mind , thinking about love : be happy , and use your main thoughts for courtship , and such beautiful shows of love that may agree with you there . ” and even there , his eyes being big with tears , turning his face away , he put his hands behind him , and with affection that was amazingly easy to feel , he shook and shook propn 's hand , and they parted like that .
i think propn only loves the world for him .
please , let ’ s go and find out where he is , and help burn up his tangled depression with some delight or other .
let ’ s do it .
now , what ’ s the news in the propn ?
why , the rumors are all saying that propn has a ship of rich cargo wrecked on the narrow seas ; i think they call the place the propn , a very dangerous , flat , and fatal place , where the dead bodies of many tall ships are buried , as they say , if my gossip reporter is an honest woman of her word .
i wish she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband .
but it is true , — without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk , — that the good propn , the honest propn , — oh , that i had a title good enough to keep his name company ! — come , the whole story .
i wish it might prove the end of his losses .
what ’ s the news among the merchants ?
you knew , none so well , none so well as you , of my daughter 's flight .
and propn , for his own part , knew the bird was ready to fly ; and then it is the nature of them all to leave the nest .
she is damned for it .
that ’ s true , if the devil may be her judge .
my own flesh and blood to rebel !
propn it , old dead man !
it rebels at this age ?
i say my daughter is my flesh and my blood .
to bait fish with : if it feeds nothing else , it will feed my revenge .
if you stick us , do n ’ t we bleed ?
if you tickle us , do n ’ t we laugh ?
if you poison us , do n ’ t we die ?
and if you wrong us , should n ’ t we seek revenge ?
if we are like you in the rest , we ’ ll resemble you in that .
if a propn wrongs a propn , what is his option ?
revenge .
if a christian wrongs a propn , what should his choice be by christian example ?
why , revenge .
the villainy you teach me i ’ ll use ; and it shall be hard but i ’ ll make the lesson better .
gentlemen , my master propn is at his house , and wants to speak with both of you .
we have been up and down looking for him .
here comes another propn : we can not match them , unless the devil himself turn propn .
have you found my daughter ?
i often came to places where i heard of her , but i can not find her .
why there , there , there , there !
a diamond gone , cost me two thousand dollars in propn !
i wish my daughter were dead at my foot , and the jewels in her ear ; i wish she were trained at my feet , and the dollars in her coffin !
why , you — loss on loss !
the thief gone with so much , and so much to find the thief ; and no satisfaction , no revenge ; or only bad luck stirring and sits on my shoulders ; no sighs except the ones i ’ m breathing ; no tears except the ones i ’ m shedding .
yes , other men have bad luck too .
antonio , as i heard in propn what , what , what ?
bad luck , bad luck ?
has his largest ship lost , coming from propn .
is it true , is it true ?
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck .
where ?
in propn ?
your daughter spent , as i heard , one night , in propn eighty dollars .
eighty dollars !
many of propn 's creditors came with me to propn , swearing he can only go broke .
i am very glad of it ; i 'll plague him , i 'll torture him ; i am glad of it .
one of them showed me a ring that he accepted from your daughter as payment for a monkey .
damn her !
you torture me , propn : it was my turquoise ring ; i got from propn , my wife , when i was still single ; i would n ’ t have traded it for a wilderness of monkeys .
but propn is certainly bankrupt .
no , that 's true ; that 's very true .
i ’ ll have his heart , if he defaults ; because , if he were out of business in propn , i can make whatever deals i want to .
go , propn , and meet me at our synagogue ; go , good propn ; at our synagogue , propn .
i could teach you how to choose right , but then i ’ m breaking my oath ; i ’ ll never do that ; you may not win me ; and if you do n ’ t , you 'll make me wish i had sinned , that i had broken my oath .
curse your eyes , they have looked me over and divided me : one half of me is yours , the other half is also yours , my own love , i would say ; but if my love , then yours , and so everything yours .
let me choose ; because as i am , i live in torture .
in torture , propn !
then confess what evil is there mingled with your love .
none but that ugly evil of mistrust , which makes me fear the enjoying of my love : there may as well be friendship and life between snow and fire as evil and my love .
yes , but i ’ m afraid you speak out of torture , where men will say anything .
well then , confess and live .
confess ” and “ love ” have been the very sum of my confession : oh , happy torment , when my torturer teaches me answers for escape from evil !
but let me go to my fortune and the chests .
he may win ; and what is music then ?
then music is propn as the trumpets when true subjects bow to a new - crowned king ; music is those sweet sounds at sunrise that creep into the dreaming bridegroom 's ear and summon him to marriage .
now he goes , with no less confidence , but with much more love , than young propn went to redeem the sacrifice of young women made by howling propn to the sea - monster : i stand for sacrifice ; the rest aloof are the dardanian wives , with tear - stained faces coming out to view the outcome of the event .
go , propn !
tell me where is fancy bred , in the heart or in the head , how begot , how nourished ?
answer ; answer .
propn , dong , bell .
these chests may not be what they seem outside : the world is still tricked by ornament .
in law , what plea is so tainted and corrupt that , being delivered with a gracious voice , obscures the evil underneath ?
in religion , what damned error is there that some sober face will bless it , and approve it with a text , hiding the grossness with a beautiful ornament ?
there is no vice so simple that it takes on some mark of virtue on outside .
thus decoration is only the deceived shore to a most dangerous sea ; the beautiful scarf veiling an indian beauty ; in a word , the seeming truth which skillful times dress in to fool the wisest men .
how all the other passions fly to the air , as doubtful thoughts , and rash - embraced despair , and shuddering fear , and green - eyed jealousy !
oh , love !
what do i find here ?
propn propn 's picture !
what minor god has come so near to making a woman ?
do these eyes move ?
here the painter plays the spider in her hair , and has woven a golden mesh to capture the hearts of men faster than gnats are caught in cobwebs : but her eyes ! — how could he see to do them ?
you that choose not by looks , propn as fair and choose as true !
since this fortune falls to you , be content and seek no other new one .
if you are well pleased with this , and hold your fortune for your bliss , turn to where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss . ” a gentle scroll .
beautiful lady , excuse me ; i come off to the side , to give and to receive .
like one of two contenders for a prize , that thinks he has done well in people 's eyes , hearing applause and universal shout , propn in spirit , still gazing in a doubt whether those peals of praise are his or not ; so , three times beautiful lady , i stand i , even like this , as doubtful of whether what i see is true , until it is confirmed , signed , and ratified by you .
propn , you have made me speechless , only my blood in my veins speaks to you , and i am so confused just as there appears buzzing among a happy crowd after a well given speech by a beloved prince ; where every piece , blended together , turns to something wild , expressed and not expressed , except for joy .
but when this ring propn from this finger , then life parts from my body : oh !
then you can be strong and say , “ propn 's dead . ” my lord and lady , now it ’ s our turn , o cry , “ good joy , ” we who have stood by and seen our wishes for you come true , good joy , my lord and lady !
my propn propn , and my gentle lady , i wish you all the joy that you can wish for yourselves ; because i am sure you ca n ’ t wish any from me ; and when you two mean to make the bargain of your vows solemn , please , even then , let me be married too .
with all my heart , if you can get a wife .
i thank you sir , you have gotten me one .
your fortune stood on the chests there , and so did mine , as it works out ; because courting here until i worked up a sweat , and swearing promises until my mouth was dry with oaths of love , at last , if her promise lasts , i got a promise of this beautiful one here to have her love , provided that you were lucky enough to get her mistress .
is this true , propn ?
propn , it is , as long as you are pleased with the rest of it .
and you , propn , are you sincere ?
yes , in faith , my lord .
our feast shall be very honored by your marriage .
we 'll bet them who has the first boy for a thousand dollars .
no ; we shall never win a bet at that sport .
but who comes here ?
lorenzo and his infidel ?
what , and my old venetian friend , propn !
so do i , my lord ; they are entirely welcome .
i thank you , sir .
for my part , my lord , i did n ’ t intend to see you here ; but , meeting with propn by the way , he begged me , past all saying no , to come along with him .
i did , my lord , and i have reason for it .
propn propn send you his regards .
before i open his letter , please tell me how my good friend is doing .
he ’ s not sick , my lord , unless it ’ s in his mind ; but he ’ s not well , unless in his mind ; his letter there will show you his state of affairs .
propn , cheer the stranger ; say hello to her .
let me shake your hand , propn .
what 's the news from propn ?
how is that royal merchant , good antonio ?
i know he will be happy at our success : we are the propn , we have won the fleece .
i wish you had won the fleece that he has lost .
there are some harsh contents in that letter that steal the color from propn 's cheeks : some dear friend is dead , or nothing else in the world could change the constitution so much of any constant man .
when i told you that i had nothing , i should have told you then that i had less than nothing , because indeed i have indebted myself to a dear friend , indebted my friend to his notorious enemy , to feed my needs .
here is a letter , lady , the paper is like the body of my friend , and every word in it , a gaping wound bleeding heavily .
but is it true , propn ?
have all his ventures failed ?
what , not one came in ?
from propn , from propn , and propn , from propn , propn , and propn ?
and not one vessel escaped the dreadful touch of the rocks that can break a merchant ?
not one , my lord .
besides , it seems that , even if he had the money right now to pay the propn , he would n ’ t take it .
when i was with him , i heard him swear to propn and to propn , his countrymen , that he would rather have propn 's flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he owed him ; and i know , my lord , if law , authority , and power , do n ’ t deny him , it will go hard with poor propn .
is it your dear friend that is in trouble like this ?
the dearest friend to me , the kindest man , the best conditioned and unwearied spirit in manners , and one in whom the ancient roman honor appears more than any man alive in propn .
how much does he owe the propn ?
for me , three thousand dollars .
what !
pay him six thousand , and destroy the promise to pay ; double six thousand , and then treble that , before a friend of this description loses a hair because of propn .
first go with me to church and marry me , and then go away to propn to your friend ; because you shall never lie by propn 's side with an uneasy soul .
but let me hear the letter of your friend .
propn propn , my ships have all sunk , my creditors grow cruel , my funds very low , my promise to pay to the propn is in default ; and since , in paying it , it is impossible for me to live , all debts between you and me are canceled if i might only see you at my death .
since i have your permission to go , i ’ ll hurry ; but , until i come back again , i will not sleep , and rest will not keep us two apart .
propn , look to him .
do n ’ t tell me about mercy ; this is the fool that lent out money for free : propn , look to him .
but , listen to me , good propn .
please listen to me speak .
i wo n ’ t be made a soft and dull - eyed fool , to shake my head , give in , and sigh , and surrender to christian intercessors .
do n ’ t follow ; i wo n ’ t put up with your speaking ; i ’ ll have my promise to pay .
it is the most difficult to understand dog that ever stayed with men .
let him alone ; i wo n ’ t follow him any more with useless prayers .
i am sure the propn will never enforce this default .
the propn can not deny the course of law , because of the benefits that strangers have with us in propn , if it is denied , it will reflect very badly on the justice of the state , because the trade and profit of the city is from all nations .
so , go ; these griefs and losses have so upset me that i shall hardly have a pound of flesh propn give to my bloody creditor .
well , jailer , let ’ s go on ; i pray good propn comes to see me pay his debt , and then i wo n ’ t care .
propn , although i ’ m saying it in front of you , you have a noble and a true understanding of godlike friendship , which appears most strongly in your behaving like this in the absence of your lord .
but if you knew to whom you give this friendship , how true a gentleman you send in relief , how dear a friend of my lord is your husband , i know you show more pride in the work than accustomed behavior can make you show .
i never did regret doing good , and i wo n ’ t now ; because in companions that talk and waste the time together , whose souls bear an equal burden of love , there must be a sharing of things like proportion of limbs , manners , and spirit , which makes me think that this propn , being the closest friend of my lord , must be like my lord .
if it ’ s true , how little is the cost i have paid in purchasing the image of my soul from out of the state of hellish cruelty !
this sounds as if i am praising of myself ; so , no more about it ; listen to other things .
i do n ’ t want you to deny this imposition , which my love and some necessity now lays on you .
propn , i shall obey you in all fair commands .
with all my heart my staff already know my mind , and will report to you and propn in place of propn propn and myself .
so goodbye until we shall meet again .
beautiful thoughts and happy hours attend on you !
i wish your ladyship all my heart 's content .
propn , i go with all convenient speed .
come on , propn , i have work in hand that you do n ’ t know about yet ; we 'll see our husbands before they think about us .
shall they see us ?
they shall , propn ; but in such a costume that they ’ ll think we are finished with that we do n ’ t have .
why , shall we turn into men ?
but come , i 'll tell you all about my whole plan when i am in my coach , which waits for us at the park gate ; and so hurry , because we must travel twenty miles today .
yes , honestly ; because , look , the sins of the father are to be laid on the children ; so , i promise you , i ’ m afraid you .
i was always honest with you , and so now , i speak my annoyance over the matter ; so be cheerful , because i honestly think you are dammed .
there is only one hope in it that can do you any good , and that is only a kind of bastard hope .
and what hope is that , please ?
propn it , you may partly hope that your father had not fathered you , that you are not the propn 's daughter .
that ’ s a kind of bastard hope indeed ; so the sins of my mother should be laid on me .
honestly , then i ’ m afraid you are dammed both by father and mother ; when i keep away from the propn propn , your father , i fall into an equal evil , your mother ; well , you are gone both ways .
i shall be saved by my husband ; he has made me a propn .
i 'll tell my husband , launcelot , what you say ; here he comes .
i shall grow jealous of you shortly , launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
i shall answer that better to the community than you can explain the swelling of the negro 's belly ; the propn is pregnant by you , launcelot .
it is important that the propn should be more than reason ; but if she is less than an honest woman , she is indeed more than i took her for .
how every fool can play on the word !
that is done , sir ; they have all stomachs .
goodly propn , what a wit - snapper are you !
then bid them prepare dinner .
that is done too , sir , only ' cover ' is the word .
will you cover , then , sir ?
not so , sir , neither ; i know my duty .
yet more quarrelling with purpose !
will you show the whole wealth of your wit propn at once ?
please understand a plain man in his plain meaning : let your fellows come on , bid them cover the table , serve in the meat , and we ’ ll come in to dinner .
for the table , sir , it shall be served in ; for the meat , sir , it shall be covered ; for your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as sense and meaning shall determine .
oh , dear judgment , how his words are suited !
the fool has planted in his memory an army of good words ; and i know many fools that stand in a better place , dressed like him , except that a tricky word defies definition .
how are you , propn ?
and now , good sweetheart , tell me your opinion , how do you like propn propn 's wife ?
so much i ca n ’ t express it .
it is very proper the propn propn live an upright life , because , having such a blessing in his lady , he finds the joys of propn here on earth ; and if he does n ’ t merit it on earth , it stands to reason he should never enter propn .
why , if two gods should play some heavenly match , and place a bet on two earthly women , and propn is one of them , there must be something else to bet on with the other , because the poor rude world does not have her equal .
you have such a husband in me as she is for a wife .
no , but ask my opinion too about that .
i ’ ll ask later ; first let ’ s go in to dinner .
no , let me praise you while i want to .
no , please , let it serve for dinner conversation ; then , no matter what you say , i shall digest it with the other things i ’ m eating up .
well , i 'll point you in the right direction .
what , is propn here ?
ready , if it pleases your grace .
i am sorry for you ; you are here to answer a rock - like opponent , an inhuman wretch , incapable of pity , void and empty of any ounce of mercy .
i have heard your propn has taken great pains to modify his stubborn course ; but since he stands solid , and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy 's reach , i confront his fury with my patience , and i am ready to suffer the very tyranny and rage of his with a quiet spirit .
go , one of you , and call the propn into the court .
he is ready at the door ; he comes , my lord .
make room , and let him stand before us .
propn , the world thinks , and i think so too , that you only carry this kind of malice to the very last hour of action ; and then , it ’ s thought , you 'll show your mercy and remorse , more strangely than your strange apparent cruelty is ; and where you now exact the penalty , — which is a pound of this poor merchant 's flesh , — you will not only loose the default , but , touched with human gentleness and love , propn half of the borrowed amount , glancing with an eye of pity on his losses , that have been so heaped on his back lately , enough to press a royal merchant down , and get sympathy for his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of stone , from stubborn propn and propn , never trained to uses of tender courtesy .
we all expect a gentle answer , propn .
you ask me why i would rather choose to have a weight of dead flesh than to receive three thousand dollars .
what if a rat troubles my house , and i am happy to give ten thousand dollars to have it captured ?
what , are n ’ t you answered yet ?
there are some men that do n ’ t love a dead pig ; some that are crazy if they see a cat ; and others , when they hear the song of the bagpipe , can not hold their urine , because sympathy , propn of passion , persuades passion to the mood of what it likes or hates .
are you answered ?
this is no answer , you unfeeling man , to excuse the flowing of your cruelty .
i am not required to please you with my answer .
do all men kill the things they do n ’ t love ?
does any man hate the thing he would n ’ t kill ?
every wrong is not a hate at first .
for your three thousand dollars , here are six .
if every dollar in six thousand dollars were in six parts , and every part a dollar , i would not take them ; i want my promise to pay .
how shall you hope for mercy , giving none ?
what judgment shall i dread , if i have done no wrong ?
let their beds be made as soft as yours , and let their palates be seasoned with such rich meats ?
i may dismiss this court by my power , unless propn , a learned doctor , whom i have sent for to determine this , comes here today .
my lord , there is a messenger waiting outside with letters from the doctor , just now arrived from propn .
propn up , propn !
the propn shall have my flesh , blood , bones , and everything , before you shall lose one drop of blood for me .
did you come from propn , from propn ?
why do you sharpen your knife so earnestly ?
to cut the default from that bankrupt there .
you make your knife sharp , not on the sole of your shoe , but on your soul , harsh propn , but no metal can , no , not the hangman 's axe , be sharpened to half the sharpness of your sharp hate .
can any prayers get through to you ?
no , none that you have sense enough to make .
oh , damn you , stubborn dog !
and , for your life , let justice be blamed .
your dog - like spirit that must have been ruled by a wolf hanged for killing a human , his evil soul falling quickly even from the gallows , and , while you lay in your unholy mother , sent itself into you , because your desires are wolfish , bloody , starved , and hungry .
he waits very nearby , to know your answer , whether you 'll admit him .
please do n ’ t let his youth be an impediment to giving him the utmost respect , because i never knew so young a body with so old a head .
give me your hand ; do you come from old propn ?
i did , my lord .
you are welcome ; take your place .
are you acquainted with the difference of opinion that is the present question before the court ?
i am thoroughly informed about the case .
which is the merchant here , and which the propn ?
antonio and old propn , both come forward .
is your name propn ?
propn is my name .
yes , so he says .
do you confess the promise to pay ?
i do .
then must the propn be merciful .
on what compulsion must i ?
tell me that .
so , propn , propn justice is your plea , consider this , that if we all got justice , none of us would see salvation ; we pray for mercy , and that same prayer teaches us all to do the deeds of mercy .
i have spoken this much to soften the justice of your plea , which if you follow , this strict court of propn must give a ruling against the merchant there .
my deeds on my head !
i want the law , the penalty , and penalty of my promise to pay .
is he unable to repay the money ?
yes ; here i brought it for him into the court ; yes , twice the sum ; if that is not enough , i ’ ll swear to pay it ten times over on penalty of the loss of my hands , my head , my heart ; if this is not enough , it must seem that evil wins over truth .
and , i beg you , twist the law once to your authority ; to do a great right , do a little wrong , and deprive this cruel devil of his will .
a prophet from the propn come to judgment !
yes , a prophet !
oh , wise young judge , how i honor you !
please , let me look on the promise to pay .
here it ’ s , most reverend doctor ; here it is .
shylock , there 's three times your money offered to you .
no , not for propn .
when it is paid according to the terms .
most heartily i beg the court to give the judgment .
why then , it is like this : you must prepare your chest for his knife .
oh , noble judge !
oh , excellent young man !
oh , wise and upright judge , how much more older are you than your looks !
so , bare your chest .
it is true .
are there scales here to weigh the flesh ?
i have them ready .
have some surgeon nearby , propn , on your responsibility , to stop his wounds , so that he wo n ’ t bleed to death .
is it so stated in the promise to pay ?
it is not expressly stated ; but so what ?
it would be good for you to do so much for charity .
i can not find it ; it ’ s not in the promise to pay .
you , merchant , have you anything to say ?
do n ’ t grieve that i am doing this for you , because here propn shows herself more kind than is her habit : it is still her habit to let the wretched man outlive his wealth , to view an age of poverty with hollow eye and wrinkled brow ; she cuts me off from the lingering repentance of such misery .
commend me to your honorable wife : tell her the story of propn 's end ; say how i loved you ; speak fairly about me in death ; and , when the tale is told , ask her to be the judge of propn propn did n ’ t once have a love .
only be sorry that you shall lose your friend , and he is not sorry that he pays your debt ; because if the propn only cuts deep enough , i 'll pay it instantly with all my heart .
antonio , i am married to a wife who is as dear to me as life itself ; but life itself , my wife , and all the world , are not worth more to me than your life ; i would lose everything , yes , sacrifice them all here to this devil , to save you .
your wife would give you little thanks for that , if she were here to listen to such an offer .
i have a wife whom , i protest , i love ; i wish she were in propn , so she could beg some power to change this currish propn .
it ’ s well you offer it behind her back ; the wish would other make a noisy house .
we are wasting time ; please , enforce sentence .
most rightful judge !
come , get ready .
is that the law ?
you yourself shall see the law ; because , as you insist on justice , be assured you shall have justice , more than you desire .
i take this offer then : pay the promise to pay three times , and let the propn go .
here is the money .
oh , propn !
an upright judge , a learned judge !
so , get ready to cut off the flesh .
do n ’ t shed any blood ; or cut less nor more , exactly just a pound of flesh : if you take more , or less , than a just pound , whether it is only so much that makes it light or heavy in the substance , or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple ; no , if the scale turns only by a hair , you die , and all your goods are seized .
a second propn , a propn , propn !
now , infidel , i have you at a disadvantage .
why does the propn wait ?
take your penalty .
give me my principal , and let me go .
i have it ready for you ; here it is .
he has refused it in the open court ; he shall merely have justice , and his promise to pay .
shall i not have just my principal ?
you shall have nothing but the penalty to be so taken at your own risk , propn .
why , then the devil give him good of it !
i 'll wait no longer .
it is enacted in the laws of propn , that , if it is proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen , the party against whom he schemes propn seize one half his goods ; the other half comes to the public treasury of the state ; and the offender 's life lies at the mercy of the propn only , above all others .
in which predicament , i say , you stand ; because it appears by this obvious proceeding that indirectly , and directly too , you have schemed against the very life of the defendant ; and you have incurred the danger that i just read to you .
so , kneel down , and beg mercy of the propn .
beg that you may have permission to hang yourself ; and still , your wealth being the penalty to pay the state , you have n ’ t got the value of a string left ; so you must be hanged at the state 's expense .
yes , for the state ; not for propn .
no , take my life and everything , do n ’ t pardon that : you take my house when you take the prop that holds my house up ; you take my life when you take the means by which i live .
what mercy can you give him , propn ?
a free rope with a nooses ; nothing else , for propn 's sake !
so if it pleases my lord , the propn , and all the court to set the fine for one half of his goods , i am content , as long as he will let me have the other half to use , to give it , on his death , to the gentleman that lately stole his daughter : two things more , that , for this favor , he presently becomes a propn ; the other , that he records a gift , here in the court , of everything he has when he dies to his son , propn , and his daughter .
he shall do this , or else i take back the pardon that i just pronounced here .
are you content , propn ?
what do you say ?
i am content .
clerk , draw up a deed of gift .
please , let me go from here ; i am not well ; send the deed after me and i ’ ll sign it .
go , but do it .
in your christening , you shall have two godfathers ; if i had been the judge , you should have had ten more , to bring you to the gallows , not to the baptismal font .
propn , i beg you to come home with me to dinner .
i am sorry that you can not stay .
antonio , thank this gentleman , because , in my opinion , you owe him a lot .
most worthy gentleman , my friend and i have been acquitted today of grievous penalties by your wisdom ; instead of three thousand dollars , due to the propn , we will freely pay for your courteous pains .
and stand indebted , over and above , in love and service to you forever .
he is well paid that is well satisfied ; and i am satisfied in delivering you , and therefore , i consider myself well paid : my mind never wanted anything else in payment .
please , recognize me when we meet again : i wish you well , and so i say goodbye .
you push me far , and so i ’ ll give in .
i ’ ll have nothing else except this only ; and now , i think , i have a mind to have it .
there 's more that depends on this ring than its value .
i will give you the most expensive in propn , and find out where it is by proclamation : only for this ring , please , excuse me .
i see , sir , you are free in making offers ; you taught me to beg first , and now i think you teach me how to answer a beggar .
good sir , this ring was given me by my wife ; and , when she put it on , she made me vow that i should not sell , or give , or lose it .
that ’ s the excuse many men use to save their gifts .
and , if your wife is not a madwoman , and knows how much i have deserved this ring , she would not hold out in being your enemy forever for giving it to me .
well , goodbye !
my propn propn , let him have the ring : let what he deserves , and with my friendship , be measured against your wife 's commandment .
go , propn , run and catch him ; give him the ring , and bring him , if you can , to propn 's house .
find the propn 's house , give him this deed , and let him sign it ; we 'll leave tonight , and be a day ahead of our husbands coming home .
this deed will be very welcome to propn .
my propn propn , listening to more advice , has sent you this ring here , and asks your company at dinner .
i ca n ’ t do that : i accept his ring most thankfully ; and please tell him so ; furthermore , please show my youth to old propn 's house .
that i will do .
we shall have old swearing that they gave the rings away to men ; but we 'll confront them , and outswear them too .
away !
hurry : you know where i ’ ll wait for you .
come , good sir , will you show me to this house ?
the moon shines bright : in such a night as this , when the sweet wind gently kissed the trees , and they made no noise , in such a night , propn i think climbed the walls of propn , and sighed his soul toward the grecian tents , where propn lay that night .
in such a night propn fearfully tripped over the dew , and saw the lion 's shadow before the lion itself , and ran away dismayed .
in such a night propn stood with a willow in her hand on the wild banks of the sea , and sent her love to return to propn .
in such a night propn gathered the enchanted herbs that renewed old propn .
in such a night propn stole away from the wealthy propn , and ran from propn with a poor love as far as propn .
in such a night propn propn swore he loved her well , stealing her soul with many vows of love , — and never a true one .
in such a night propn propn , like a little witch , propn about her love , and he forgave her .
i would out - night you , if no one was coming , but , listen , i hear the footsteps of a man .
who comes so quickly in silence of the night ?
a friend .
a friend !
what friend ?
your name , please , friend ?
propn is my name , and i bring word that my mistress will be here at propn before the break of day ; she wanders about by holy crosses , where she kneels and prays for happy marriage hours .
who comes with her ?
no one but a holy hermit and her maid .
please , is my master returned yet ?
hey , hey !
whoa , ha , hey !
hey , hey !
who calls ?
hey !
hey , hey !
hey !
where ?
where ?
here !
tell him there 's a letter arrived from my master with his horn full of good news ; my master will be here before morning .
my friend propn , let them know , please , within the house , that your mistress is at hand , and bring your music outside .
how sweet the moonlight sleeps on this bank !
we will sit here and let the sounds of music propn into our ears ; soft stillness and the night propn the touches of sweet harmony .
and wake the goddess of propn with a hymn ; pierce your mistress ’ ear with sweetest touches , and bring her home with music .
i am never happy when i hear sweet music .
the man that has no music in him , or is not moved by harmony of sweet sounds , is fit for treasons , plots , and stealing ; the movement of his spirit is as dull as night , and his affections are as dark as the place between propn and hell .
a good deed in a naughty world shines like that .
when the moon was shining , we did not see the candle .
a substitute shines as brightly as a king until a king is back , and then the substitute ’ s propn drains away , as an inland brook does into the river of waters .
music !
listen !
it is your music , madam , from the house .
nothing is good , i see , without respect : i think it sounds much sweeter at night than by day .
silence bestows that virtue on it , madam .
the crow sings as sweetly as the lark when either is waited on , and i think the nightingale , if she sang by day , when every goose is cackling , would be considered no better a musician than the wren .
the moon sleeps with her lover , and does not want to be awakened !
that is the voice , or i am much mistaken , of propn .
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo , by my bad voice .
dear lady , welcome home .
we have been praying for our husbands ' welfare , which are moving along quickly , we hope , the better for our words .
have they returned ?
propn , not yet ; but there is come a messenger ahead of them , to show that they are coming .
go in , propn : give orders to my servants that they take no notice at all of our being absent from here ; nor you , propn ; propn , nor you .
we should hold day with the direct opposite , if you would walk in absence of the sun .
i thank you , madam ; give welcome to my friend : this is the man , this is propn , to whom i am so infinitely indebted .
no more than i am well released from .
a quarrel , hey , already !
what 's the matter ?
you swore to me , when i gave it you , that you would wear it until the hour of your death , and that it would go with you to your grave ; you should have respected and have kept it though not for me , but for your intense oaths .
gave it a judge 's clerk !
no , propn 's my judge , the clerk will never grow a beard that took it .
he will , if he lives to be a man .
yes , if a woman lives to be a man .
now , by this hand , i gave it to a youth , a kind of boy , a little scrubbed boy no taller than you , the judge 's clerk ; a chattering boy that asked for it as a fee ; i could not , for my heart , deny him the ring .
you are to blame , — i must be plain with you , — to part so quickly with your wife 's first gift , a thing stuck on your finger with oaths , and so nailed with faith to your flesh with faith .
i gave my love a ring , and made him swear never to part with it , and here he stands , i would dare to swear for him that he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for all the wealth in the world .
now , truly , propn , you give your wife a cause for grief that is very unkind ; if it was given to me , i should be angry about it .
why , it would be better if i cut my left hand off , and swear i lost the ring defending it .
my propn propn gave his ring away to the judge that asked for it , and indeed deserved it too ; and then the boy , his clerk , that took some pains in writing , he asked for mine ; and neither man nor master would take anything else but the two rings .
what ring did you give , my lord ?
not the one , i hope , that you got from me .
if i could add a lie to a fault , i would deny it ; but you see my finger has n ’ t got the ring on it ; it is gone .
and neither will i until i see mine again .
propn propn , if you knew to whom i gave the ring , if you knew for whom i gave the ring , and would think about for what i gave the ring , and how unwillingly i let the ring go , when nothing would be accepted but the ring , you would decrease the strength of your anger .
if you had known the virtue of the ring , or half the worthiness of her who gave the ring , or your own honor to hold the ring , you would n ’ t have parted then with the ring .
what man is there so very unreasonable , that , if you had bothered to defend it with any terms of earnestness , lacked the modesty to encourage the thing be held as a ceremony ?
propn teaches me what to believe : i 'll die for it , but some woman took the ring .
no , by my honor , madam , by my soul , no woman took it , but a civil doctor , which refused three thousand dollars of me , and begged for the ring , which i denied him , and let him go away displeased , even he that had delayed the very life of my dear friend .
what should i say , sweet lady ?
i forced to send the ring after him ; i was overcome with shame and courtesy ; my honor would not let ingratitude so much offend it .
pardon me , good lady ; because , by these blessed candles of the night , if you had been there , i think you would have begged the ring from me to give the worthy doctor .
and i his clerk ; so be well advised how you leave me to my own protection .
well , do so : do n ’ t let me take him then ; because , if i do , i 'll break the young clerk 's pen .
i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels .
propn , do n ’ t grieve ; you are welcome nevertheless .
propn , forgive me this forced wrong ; and in the hearing of these many friends , i swear to you , even by your own beautiful eyes , that i see myself in , — listen , only that !
in both my eyes , he doubly sees himself , one in each eye ; swear by your double self , and there 's an oath to believe .
no , but listen to me : pardon this fault , and , by my soul , i swear i will never again break an oath made to you .
then you shall be his insurance .
give him this , and tell him keep it better than the other one .
here , propn propn , swear to keep this ring .
i got it from him : pardon me , propn , because , by this ring , the doctor slept with me .
and pardon me , my gentle propn , because that same scrubbed boy , the doctor 's clerk , instead of this , slept with me last night .
are we betrayed before we have deserved it ?
i am speechless .
you were the doctor , and i did n ’ t know you ?
you were you the clerk that is to betray me ?
yes , but the clerk that never means to do it , unless he lives until he is a man .
sweet doctor , you shall be my lover : when i am absent , then you can lie with my wife .
sweet lady , you have given me life and living , because here i read for certain that my ships have safely come home .
how is it now , propn !
my clerk has some good comforts for you , too .
beautiful ladies , you drop holy bread in the way of starved people .
it is almost morning , and i am still sure you are not totally satisfied about these events full .
let ’ s go in ; and ask us all your questions , and we ’ ll answer everything truthfully .
well , while i live , i 'll fear no other thing so much as keeping propn 's ring safe .
now , fair propn , the time for our wedding is very close ; just four more happy days until the new moon .
four days will quickly dissolve into four nights ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; and then the moon , like a silver slice in the heavens , will light the night of our wedding solemnities .
go , propn , stir up the young people of propn to start swinging ; get the party spirit going ; turn sadness back to the funerals — no sadness at our parties .
propn , i got you by waging war with you , and made you love me by doing you injuries ; but i will marry you in a different way , with pomp , with triumph , and with partying !
regards to propn , our renowned duke !
since she belongs to me , i may dispose of her , which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death , according to our law which is fit to these circumstances .
what do you say , propn ?
be careful , fair maid .
to you your father should be as a god , a god that created your beauty , yes , and a god who sees you as a piece of wax that he has imprinted , and it is within his power to leave the wax as it is , or to disfigure it .
propn is a worthy gentleman .
so is propn .
in any other case , he is .
i wish my father could see with my eyes .
no , you must see with your father ’ s eyes .
i beg your grace to pardon me .
either to die or to swear to avoid the society of men forever .
therefore , fair propn , think about what you ’ re doing , think about how young you are , examine your choices well , whether , if you do n ’ t take your father 's choice , you can endure life in a convent , to be shut up in a cloister , to live a childless nun all your life , chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon .
those who can discipline themselves to undertake such a heavenly path for piety are blessed three times ; but those who are in a convent to avoid marriage grow , live , and die , in single blessedness .
well , that ’ s how i will grow , live , and die , my lord , before i will give up my virginity to his lordship .
take time to think about it ; and , by the next new moon , — the wedding day of my love and me , for the everlasting bond of fellowship , — on that day either prepare to die because you have disobeyed your father 's will ; or else marry propn , as your father wants you to ; or accept the austerity and single life of a nun .
give in , sweet propn ; — and , propn , give up your crazy claim to my future bride .
scornful lysander !
yes , propn has my approval ; and everything i own i will leave to him ; and she is mine ; and all my rights concerning her , i leave to propn .
i am , my lord , as well born as he is , as rich ; my love is better than his ; my fortunes , no matter which way you look at it , are as good as propn ' ; and , furthermore , which is more important than all these qualities , propn loves me too !
why should n ’ t i pursue hermia ?
propn , i 'll swear it on his head , pursued propn 's daughter , propn , the same way , and won her soul ; and she , sweet lady , loves , devoutly loves , loves to the point of divine worship , this spotted and inconstant man .
are you okay , my love ?
propn and propn , go ahead ; i must ask you to do a few things about the wedding , and meet with you about some issues that affect you .
we follow you , because we should and because we want to .
what ’ s the matter , my love !
why do you look so pale ?
why do the roses in your cheeks fade so fast ?
oh dear !
i am too good to be in love with someone so low !
or else mismatched in terms of years ; — oh spite !
i am too old to be engaged to someone so young !
to choose love by what another person sees !
a good argument ; therefore , listen to me , propn .
there , gentle propn , i may marry you ; and the sharp athenian law can not follow us to that place .
if you love me then , propn away from your father 's house tomorrow night ; and , in the forest , three miles outside town , where i met you once , with propn , to celebrate a propn propn morning party , i will wait for you there .
my good lysander !
i swear to you by propn 's strongest bow , by his best arrow , the one with the golden head , by the simplicity of propn ' doves , by that which knits souls and favors lovers , and by that fire which burned propn , the propn queen , when the false propn , propn , was seen sailing away , — by all the vows that men have forever broken , in greater numbers than women have ever spoken , — in that same place you have described to me , i will meet you tomorrow , truly .
keep that promise , love .
look , here comes propn .
hi , fair propn !
where are you going ?
if the world were mine , and propn mine , i would give everything else to you to be changed anyway you want .
oh , teach me your look , and with what magic you have stolen propn ' heart !
i frown at him , but he still loves me .
oh i wish your frowns would teach my smiles to have that effect !
i give him curses , but he gives me love .
oh that my prayers could be answered with such affection !
the more i hate him , the more he follows me around .
the more i love him , the more he hates me .
his silly behavior , propn , is not my fault .
take it easy ; he shall see my face no more ; propn and i are going to leave this place quickly .
before i started seeing propn , propn seemed like a paradise to me .
oh , so what graces , then , does he have , that he has turned a heaven into hell !
we must not give in to hugs and kisses until midnight tomorrow .
i will , my propn .
how happy can some other “ other ” be !
i am considered as fair as she is throughout propn .
but so what ?
propn does n ’ t think so ; he wo n ’ t know what everyone but him knows .
love can transpose things that are low and ugly , having no good qualities at all , into things that have beauty and dignity .
love does n ’ t look with the eyes , but with the mind ; and that ’ s why propn is painted with a blindfold .
because , before propn looked on propn 's eyes , he swore many oaths that he was only mine ; and , when this torrent of oaths was rejected by propn , propn dissolved , and his oaths melted too .
i ’ ll tell him of fair propn 's flight ; then tomorrow night , he will pursue her to the forest , and , even if he just thanks me for this knowledge , it is sweet payment .
but i mean to make my pain worth suffering , to have him look at me there and back again .
is everybody here ?
it would be better if you took attendance , man by man , according to the list .
here is the list of every man 's name , who are thought to be the best in all propn , to play in our play before the duke and duchess at night on their wedding - day .
first , good propn propn , tell us what the play ’ s about , then read the names of the actors ; and so get to the point .
by propn , our play is — the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of propn and propn .
ok , guys , spread out .
i ’ m ready .
tell me what my part is , and then proceed .
you , propn propn , are set down for propn .
what is propn ?
a lover , or a tyrant ?
a lover that kills himself most gallantly for love .
that will require some tears in the true performance of it .
i will move them to storms of tears ; i will rouse their pity in some measure .
propn propn , the bellows - mender .
here , propn propn .
flute , you must take the role of propn .
what is propn ?
a wandering knight ?
it is the lady that propn loves .
no , please , do n ’ t let me play a woman ; i have a beard starting t o grow .
that ’ s nothing to worry about ; you shall play it with a mask on , and you can make your voice as light as you want .
if i can hide my face , let me play propn too .
ok . go ahead .
propn propn , the tailor .
here , propn propn .
here , propn propn .
have you written the lion 's part ?
please , if it is , give it to me now , because i am slow in studying my lines .
you may do it off the top of your head , because it ’ s nothing but roaring .
let me play the lion too .
i will roar so well that it will do any man 's heart good to hear me ; i will roar so well that i will make the duke say , “ let him roar again , let him roar again . ” if you should do it too terribly , you would so frighten the duchess and the ladies , that they would scream ; and that would be enough to hang us all .
that would hang us , every mother 's son .
you can play no part but propn ; for propn is a sweet - faced man ; a proper man that you shall see on a summer 's day ; a most lovely gentleman - like man ; therefore you must absolutely play propn .
ok , i ’ ll do it .
what beard would be best to play it in ?
whichever one you want .
i will play it in either your straw - color beard , your orange - tawny beard , your purple - in - grain beard , or your french - crown - color beard , your perfect yellow .
some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play it with no beard !
in the meantime , i will draw a list of props , that our play needs .
i beg you , do n ’ t let me down .
we will meet ; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
be careful ; be perfect ; goodbye .
we ’ ll meet at the duke 's oak .
enough ; stay or get going !
hey , spirit !
where are you going ?
over hill , over dale , through bush , through brier , over park , over pale , through flood , through fire , i am going everywhere , propn than the moon goes through the sky ; and i serve the fairy queen , to put dewdrops into her eyes upon the green .
propn , you group of spirits ; i have to get going .
our queen and all her elves are coming here any minute !
propn is really angry and annoyed , because she , just like her attendant , has a lovely boy , that was stolen from an indian king ; she has never had so sweet a baby that was stolen .
and now propn and propn can never meet in the grove or on green , by a clear fountain , or spangled shiny starlight , but they refuse to settle the issue , so that all their elves propn into acorn cups , and hide them there , because they ’ re so frightened .
are n ’ t you the guy that scares the maidens of the village ; propn cream from milk , and sometimes works the churn , and , bootless , makes the breathless housewife churn even harder ; and sometimes makes the drink so that it does n ’ t have a yeasty foam ; propn wanderers who are out at night , laughing at their getting lost ?
those that call you propn , and sweet propn , you do their work , and they shall have good luck .
i am that merry wanderer of the night .
i am jester to propn and make him smile , as when i trick a fat horse that ’ s been eating beans into neighing like a newborn female ; and sometimes , i hide near to the town gossip 's beer mug , looking like a roasted crab ; and , when the gossip drinks , i bob up , against her lips , and pour the ale on the withered skin of her neck skin all the way down .
how unfortunate to meet you by moonlight , proud propn .
well , well , jealous propn !
fairies , let ’ s go ; i have sworn not to go to his bed or to keep his company .
am not i your lord ?
then i must be your lady ; but i also know that , when you have stolen away from fairy - land , and , taking the shape of propn , the shepherd , you have sat all day , playing on pipes of corn , and speaking love poems to amorous propn .
how can you say these things , for shame , propn , give me a little more credit than that with propn , knowing i know all about your love for propn ?
did n ’ t you lead him through the glimmering night from propn , the girl he had just raped ?
and make him break his promise with fair propn , not to mention with propn and propn ?
these fogs which , falling in the land , have made every rough river so high that they have flooded the continents where they flow .
the human mortals want their winter here ; blessed hymns and carols are sung every night— the moon that controls the flow of the floods , propn in her anger , washes all the air , but there are still many bad diseases .
ice - cold frosts freeze the fresh crimson roses ; and on the old propn of propn ’ s chin and icy crown , is set a circle of sweet summer buds almost in mockery of the frost .
the spring , the summer , the pregnant autumn , and angry winter change their usual clothes ; and the amazed world , now does n ’ t know which is which by their apparel .
then fix it .
why should propn cross her propn ?
but she , because she was mortal , died giving birth to the boy ; and , for her sake , i am raising him , and , for her sake , i will not part with him .
how long do you intend to stay within this forest ?
maybe until after propn ' wedding - day .
if you will patiently join our dances , and see our moonlight parties , go with us ; if not , leave me alone , and i wo n ’ t comment on where you ’ re going .
give me that boy and i will go with you .
not for your entire fairy kingdom .
fairies , let ’ s go .
this will only lead to another argument if i stay longer .
my gentle propn , come here .
you remember that time i sat on a big rock by the ocean , and heard a mermaid , on a dolphin 's back , singing such a sweet and melodious song that the rough sea became calm when it heard it , and certain stars shot madly out of their orbits to hear the sea - maid 's music ?
i remember .
but i watched and noted where propn ’ s arrow fell .
putting the juice of it on sleeping eyelids will make or man or woman madly fall in love with the next live creature that it sees .
fetch me this herb and come right back before a huge sea creature can swim three miles .
i 'll make my trip around the world in forty minutes .
and before i remove this charm from her sight — because i have another herb that is the antidote — i 'll make her give that boy to me .
but who ’ s coming here ?
i ’ ll make myself invisible , and i eavesdrop on their conversation .
i do n ’ t love you , so stop following me .
where are propn and fair hermia ?
i ’ ll kill him , and she kills me .
you told me they snuck into this forest , and i ’ m here and wander within this forest , because i can not meet propn .
listen , get going and , once and for all , stop following me !
even if you did n ’ t have the power to pull me , i would still be powerless not to follow you .
do i encourage you ?
do i talk to you sweetly ?
or , rather , do i not , in plainest truth , tell you i do not and can not love you ?
and even for that , i love you all the more .
i am your spaniel , and , propn , the more you beat me , the more i will wag my tail for you .
what worse place can i beg in your love , and still keep my self - respect — than to be used as you would use your dog ?
do n ’ t try my patience and push me too hard , because the sight of you makes me sick .
and i am sick when i do n ’ t look at you .
you are really putting your virginity at risk , to leave the city , and surrender yourself to the hands of someone who does n ’ t love you , to go night thinking that nothing can happen , and to come to a deserted place , with something as rich as your virginity .
i trust your virtue as a man .
it is n ’ t night whenever i see your face , so i do n ’ t think it ’ s night , and this forest does n ’ t lack worlds of company , for you , in my respect , are all the world .
then how can it be said i am alone when the entire world is here to look at me ?
i 'll run from you , and hide in the bushes , and leave you to the mercy of wild beasts .
propn flies , and propn chases him ; the dove pursues the vulture ; the mild deer runs faster to catch the tiger — helpless speed , when cowardice chases and courage flies .
ay , in the temple , in the town , the field , you do something to me .
shame on you , propn !
i 'll follow you , and make a heaven of hell , to die by the hand that i love so well .
welcome , wanderer .
yes , there it is .
please give it to me .
you ’ ll be able to identify the man by the athenian garments he has on .
please do this carefully , that he will be more in love with her than she is with him .
and meet me before the first rooster crows at dawn .
you have nothing to be afraid of , my lord ; i ’ ll do it .
come , now a dance and a fairy song , then , for the third part of a minute , leave here , some to kill bugs in the musk - rose buds , some to kill red - mice for their leather wings , to make my small elves coats ; and some to quiet the noisy owl , that nightly hoots and wonders about us .
sing me now to sleep , then go to your tasks , and let me rest .
you spotted snakes , with double tongue , thorny hedgehogs , be not seen ; propn and blindworms do no wrong ; come not near our fairy queen .
philomel , with melody , sing in our sweet lullaby .
lulla , lulla , lullaby ; lulla , lulla , lullaby .
let ’ s go ; now all is well .
one of you , stand sentinel over there .
wake when some vile thing is near .
fair love , you are exhausted with wandering in the forest .
you find yourself a bed , and i will rest my head upon this bank .
one bit of land will be a pillow for us both ; one heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one trust .
oh , sweetheart , take what i said in an innocent sense .
love takes the meaning in love 's conversation .
then do n ’ t tell me not to sleep by your side , because in sleeping near you , propn , i do not lie .
lysander riddles very prettily .
now curse my manners and my pride if propn meant to say propn lied !
may your love never change until your sweet life ends !
amen , amen , i say to that fair prayer , and then my life end when i end loyalty !
i ’ ve gone through the whole forest , but i have n ’ t found any propn on whose eyes i might pour this flower 's juice to stir his love .
pretty soul !
she does n ’ t dare lie propn this lack - love , this kill - courtesy .
so awake when i am gone ; for i must go now to propn .
stay , though you kill me , sweet propn .
i order you , get far away from me and do not haunt me thus .
oh , will you , a dark - natured man , leave me ?
do n ’ t .
stay here at your own risk ; i will go on alone .
oh , i am out of breath in this happy chase !
the more i pray , the less grace i have .
hermia is happy , wherever she lies , because she has blessed and attractive eyes .
how did her eyes come to be so bright ?
what wicked and lying mirror of mine made me compare my eyes with propn 's ?
but who ’ s here ? — propn !
on the ground !
i see no blood , no wound .
propn , if you live , good sir , wake up !
and i will run through fire , i will , for your sweet sake .
propn propn !
nature has made it so that i can see through your chest all the way to your heart .
where is propn ?
oh , how fitting it is that that vile name should perish on my sword !
do n ’ t say that , propn , do n ’ t say that .
so what if he loves your hermia ?
propn , so what ?
content with propn ?
the will of man is persuaded by his reason , and reason says you are the worthier maid .
things that grow are not ripe until it ’ s their season to be ripe , so i , being young , have not been ripened in reason , and touching the point of human skill now , propn has become the commander of my will , and it leads me to your eyes , where i see propn 's stories , written in love 's richest book .
why was i born to this keen mockery ?
when did i earn this scorn at your hands ?
is n ’ t it enough , is n ’ t it enough , young man , that i never did , no , nor never can deserve a sweet look from propn ' eye , but you must joke about what i ’ m lacking ?
good lord , you do me wrong— good lord , you do— to court me in such disdainful manner .
oh , that a lady of one man refused should therefore be abused by another !
lysander , look how i shake with fear !
what , gone ?
lysander !
lord !
what , ca n ’ t hear me ?
gone ?
no sound , no word ?
o my , where are you ?
speak , if you hear me ; speak , of all loves !
i almost faint with fear .
no ? — then i can see that you ’ re not near .
i 'll find either death or you immediately .
are we all here ?
ready , ready ; and here 's a marvelously convenient place for our rehearsal .
this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn bush our dressing room , and we will do it just as we will do it before the duke .
propn quince— what do you say , bully bottom ?
there are things in this comedy of “ propn and propn ” that will never please an audience .
first , propn must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies can not stand .
what do you think about that ?
propn , a risky business .
i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is said and done .
this will keep them from being frightened .
no , make it two lines more .
wo n ’ t the ladies be afraid of the lion ?
i ’ m afraid so , i promise you .
well then , another prologue must say that he is not really a lion .
you must tell his name and half his face must be seen through the lion 's neck , and he himself must speak through the mask saying this , or something to the same defect , — '' ladies , `` or `` fair ladies , i would wish you , or , i would request you , or , i would entreat you , not to be afraid , not to tremble .
my life for yours .
if you think i come here as a lion , shame on me .
well , ok .
but there are two more hard things , that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber , because , as you know , propn and propn meet by moonlight .
does the moon shine that night we play our play ?
a calendar , a calendar !
yes , it does shine that night .
why , then may you leave a panel of the great chamber - window , where we play , open ; and the moon may shine in at that panel .
ay , or else someone must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern , and say he comes to imitate or to present the person of moonshine .
some man or other must look like a wall , and let him have some plaster , or some loam , or some rough - cast cement around him to signify the wall , and let him hold his fingers open like this , and through that cranny , propn and propn will whisper .
if that can be done , then i think we ’ ve covered everything .
come , sit down , every mother 's son , and rehearse your parts .
what woven country - folk do we have swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ?
what , a play !
i 'll listen , be an actor too perhaps , if i see a place to jump in .
must i speak now ?
ay , darn it , you must because you must understand he only goes to see a noise that he heard , and will come again .
you speak your whole part all at once , cues , and all .— propn enter .
oh strange !
we are attacked by ghosts .
let ’ s go , guys !
help !
i 'll follow you ; i 'll lead you in a circle , through bog , through bush , through more bushes , through brier ; sometimes i ’ ll be a horse , sometimes a hound dog , a hog , a headless bear , sometimes a fire ; and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .
why do they run away ?
this is a bad joke of theirs to frighten me .
oh propn , you are changed !
what do i see on you ?
what do you see ?
you see an donkey - head of your own , do you ?
this is to make a donkey of me , to frighten me , if they can .
the black rooster , so black of hue , with orange - tawny bill , the thrush with his note so true , the wren with little quill .
what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ?
so my eye is very attracted to your shape ; and your fair virtue 's force violently moves me , on the first look of you , to say , to swear , i love you .
the more ’ s the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends .
no , i can only make a joke for a specific occasion .
you are as wise as you are beautiful .
i am a spirit of no simple power— the summer still waits for me and i love you .
propn !
and propn !
ready .
and i .
and i .
and i .
where shall we go ?
be kind and courteous to this gentleman ; jump into his steps as he walks and dance in his eyes ; feed him apricots and dewberries , purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; steal the honey bags from the bumblebees , and , for night lights , cut their waxen thighs , and light them at the fiery glow - worm 's eyes , in order to have my love go to sleep and wake up , and pluck the wings from painted butterflies , to fan the moonbeams out of sleeping eyes .
propn him , elves , and do him courtesies .
propn , mortal !
propn !
propn !
propn !
i beg your honors ’ mercy , heartily .— what is your name ?
propn .
i would like to get to know you better , good propn propn .
propn .
propn .
propn propn propn , i know you well .
that same cowardly giant - like roast beef has devoured many people from your family .
i promise you your relatives have made my eyes water before now .
i want to get to know you as well , good propn propn .
come on , wait on him ; lead him to my private apartment .
the moon , i think , looks as if she has watery eyes , and when she weeps , every little flower weeps , lamenting some enforced chastity .
cover his mouth , bring him silently .
i wonder if propn is up yet , and what it was that next came into her sight , which she must love in the extreme .
what ’ s going on now about this haunted grove ?
my mistress is in love with a monster .
near to her close and consecrated private place , while she was sleeping , a crew of actors , rude mechanicals , that work for bread near athenian shops , were met together to rehearse a play intended for great propn ' wedding day .
the stupidest man of these dim country - folk who acted propn in their rehearsal , exited from his scene and entered in a bunch of bushes , when i took advantage of him and i fixed donkey 's head on his head .
then , his propn must be answered , and my creation comes back to the rehearsal .
their senses thus weakened , lost within their strong fears , made senseless things begin to do them wrong , because briers and thorns catch their clothes , some sleeves , some hats .
this works out better than i could have planned .
but have you touched the propn 's eyes with the love - juice yet , as i told you to ?
i did it while he was sleeping , — that is finished too , — and the athenian woman by his side , so that , when he woke up , she must , of course , be the first he saw .
stand close ; this is the same propn .
this is the woman , but not this the man .
oh , why do you reject him that loves you so ?
say these bitter things to your bitter foe .
now i only scold , but i should give you worse ; because you , i fear , has given me cause to curse .
if you have slain propn in his sleep , being in blood over your shoes , plunge the knife propn into me and kill me too .
the sun was not as true to the daytime as he was to me .
would he have stolen away from sleeping propn ?
i 'd believe as quickly that this whole earth may be bored , and that the moon may creep through the centre and so disrupt her brother 's noontide with the other side of the world .
it can only mean that you have murdered him ; a murderer should look like you , so dead , so grim .
what 's this got to do with my lysander ?
where is he ?
ah , good propn , will you give him to me ?
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds .
get out , dog !
get out , low - life !
you drive me past the bounds of a maiden 's patience .
have you slain him , then ?
oh !
for once tell the truth ; tell the truth , even for my sake .
did you dare to look at him , being awake , and have you killed him sleeping ?
oh brave touch !
could n ’ t a worm , a poisonous snake , do as much ?
i am not guilty of killing propn ; and he is n ’ t dead , as far as i can tell .
i beg you , tell me , then , that he is well .
and if i could , what should i get for saying so ?
you will see me no more , whether he be dead or not .
so sorrow 's heaviness does heavier grow because my sleep has been interrupted .
what have you done ?
you have made a major mistake , and laid the love - juice on some true - love 's sight .
some true love turned false must follow because of your mistake , and not a false love turned true .
then fate overrules me , that , as one man keeping his promise , a million fail in keeping theirs , confusing oath on oath .
i go , i go ; look how i go , — propn than an arrow from the barbarian ’ s bow .
flower with this purple dye , hit by propn 's arrow , propn into the apple of his eye !
captain of our fairy band , propn is here at hand , and the youth mistaken by me pleading for her love ; shall we watch what they ’ re doing ?
o , beware , my lord , of jealousy ; propn , what fools these mortals be !
stand aside .
the noise they make will cause propn to awake .
why should you think that i should not court you seriously ?
you can not find scorn and derision in tears of love .
look , when i vow , i weep ; and vows that are born in tears show the whole truth at that moment .
how can these things in me seem like ridicule to you , when my tears prove them to be true ?
you move your cunning ahead more and more .
when truth kills truth , oh devilish - holy fight !
these vows are propn 's .
will you give her up ?
i had no sense of judgment when i swore love to her .
nor none , in my mind , now you give her up .
propn loves her , and he does n ’ t love you .
what , my love , shall i compare your eyes to ?
crystal is muddy .
oh , how ripe your lips are , those kissing cherries grow tempting !
when you hold up your hand that pure congealed white top , propn propn ' snow , fanned with the eastern wind , turns to a crow .
oh , let me kiss this princess hand of pure white , this seal of bliss !
oh spite !
oh hell !
i see you all are bent to set against me for your entertainment .
if you were civil and had any manners , you would n ’ t insult me so much like this .
ca n ’ t you just hate me , as i know you do , instead of joining together to mock me too ?
if you were men , as you are men on the outside , you would n ’ t use a gentle lady like this : to vow , and swear , and super - praise my parts , when i am sure you hate me with your hearts .
you both are rivals and love propn ; and now both rivals to mock propn .
a really good exploit , a manly enterprise , to bring up tears in a poor maid 's eyes with your insults !
none of the noble sort would so offend a virgin and try a poor soul 's patience , all to make you laugh .
you are unkind , propn ; do n ’ t be like that , because you love propn .
never did mockers waste more idle breath .
propn , keep your hermia ; i will have none of her .
if i ever loved her , all that love is gone .
my heart journeyed to her only like a guest , and now has returned home to propn , there to remain .
propn , it ’ s not true .
but why did you leave me so unkindly ?
why should he stay whom love presses to go ?
what love could press propn from my side ?
propn 's love , that would not let him wait , — propn propn , — who makes the night more golden than all the fiery rays and eyes of light .
why are you looking for me ?
could n ’ t this make you know that the hate i have for you made me leave you like that ?
you do n ’ t speak as you think ; it can not be .
wow , she is one of this conspiracy !
now i see that all three have gotten together to design this false joke in spite of me .
insulting propn !
most ungrateful maid !
have you conspired , have you contrived with these men to bait me with this disgusting insult ?
is all the conversation that we two have shared , the sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent , when we have scolded the clock for parting us , — oh , is it all forgotten ?
all school - days ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
we , propn , like two artificial gods , have created both one flower with our needles , both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , both warbling of one song , both in one key ; as if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , had been incorporated into one .
and will you tear our ancient love apart to join with men in scorning your poor friend ?
have you not set propn , as in scorn , to follow me , and praise my eyes and face ?
and made your other love , propn who even just a minute ago spurned me with his foot , — to call me goddess , nymph , divine , and rare , precious , celestial ?
why does he speak this to me whom he hates ?
and why does propn deny your love , so rich within his soul , and give me , indeed , affection , except by your putting them up to it , by your consent ?
although i may not be as graceful as you , so hung upon with love , so fortunate , but most miserable most , to love and still be unloved ?
you should pity rather than despise this situation .
i do n ’ t understand what you mean by this .
if you have any pity , grace , or manners , you would not make me such an argument .
stay , gentle propn ; hear my reason ; my love , my life , my soul , fair propn !
oh excellent !
sweet , do n ’ t scorn her like that .
if she can not beg , i can order .
you can order no more than she can beg ; your threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.— propn , i love you ; by my life i do ; i swear , by that which i will lose for you , to prove him a liar that says i do n ’ t love you .
i say i love you more than he does .
if you say so , go away , and prove it too .
away , you black giant !
you are a tame man ; go !
why have you become so rude ?
what change is this , sweet love ?
your love !
get out , tawny barbarian , out !
out , loathed medicine !
hated potion , get away !
you are n ’ t joking ?
yes , truly , and so do you .
propn , i will keep my word with you .
i wish i had your guarantee , because i see that a weak bond holds you ; i 'll not trust your word .
although i hate her , i 'll not harm her like that .
what !
can you do me greater harm than hate ?
hate me !
why ?
oh me !
what news , my love ?
are n ’ t i hermia ?
are n ’ t you lysander ?
why then , you left me , — oh , the gods forbid ! — seriously , shall i say ?
therefore be out of hope , of question , doubt , be certain , nothing truer ; it ’ s no joke that i do hate you and love propn .
oh me !
you juggler !
you rotten scoundrel !
you thief of love !
what !
have you come by night , and stolen my love 's heart from him ?
fine , ok !
do n ’ t you have any modesty , any maiden shame , any touch of bashfulness ?
what !
will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue ?
shame on you ! , shame on you ! !
you counterfeit , you puppet , you !
ok , so that ’ s the way the game goes .
how low am i , you painted maypole ?
i am not yet so low that my nails ca n ’ t reach yours eyes .
i beg you , although you mock me , gentlemen , do n ’ t let her hurt me .
i was never cursed ; i have no gift at all in being a fighter ; i am a right maid for my cowardice ; do n ’ t let her strike me .
you may think , perhaps , because she is something lower than myself , that i can match her movements .
propn propn , do n ’ t be so angry with me .
i always loved you , hermia ; always kept your counsels ; never wronged you ; except that , because of my love for propn , i told him of your running away into this forest .
let me go .
you see how simple and how in love i am .
why , get going .
who ’ s stopping you ?
a foolish heart that i ’ m leaving behind here .
what !
with propn ?
with propn .
do n ’ t be afraid ; she shall not harm you , propn .
no , sir , she shall not , although you take her side .
little again !
let me get her .
get going , you dwarf ; you zero , made of scraps of grass ; you bead , you acorn .
you are too over - zealous on her behalf that rejects your services .
follow !
no , i 'll go with you , cheek by jowl .
you , mistress , all this trouble is because of you .
no , do n ’ t go back .
i will not trust you , i wo n ’ t ; and i ’ ll stay in your cursed company no longer .
your hands are quicker than mine for a fight ; my legs are longer , though , to run away .
i am amazed , and do n ’ t know what to say .
this is your negligence .
either you are really mistaken , or you commit these errors willfully .
believe me , king of shadows , i was really mistaken .
did n ’ t you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ?
and so far i am glad it worked out this way , because i am really enjoying the show .
do you see that these lovers are looking for a place to fight ?
get going , then , propn , make the night darker ; cover the stars in the sky with drooping fog , as black as propn , and lead these testy rivals so astray that they will not come within another 's way .
sometimes , imitate propn ’ s voice , to stir up propn anger ; and sometimes , sound like propn ; and that way you can lead them from each other , until sleep imitating death creeps over their eyebrows with leaden legs and batty wings .
then crush this herb into propn 's eye ; its juice has the virtuous property of removing all error from his eyes and will make his eyeballs roll with correct sight .
when they next wake up , all this conflict shall seem to be a dream and a worthless vision ; and back to propn the lovers shall go with happiness and agreement that will never end .
while i use you to solve this affair , i 'll go to my queen , and beg the indian boy from her ; and then i will release her charmed eye so that she will see the monster , and all things shall be at peace .
my fairy lord , this must be done very quickly , because night is quickly coming to an end ; and over there is the first hint of morning sunlight , which , when it is seen by ghosts wandering here and there , they all troop home to the graveyards .
up and down , up and down ; i will lead them up and down .
the field and town are afraid of me .
propn , lead them up and down .
here comes one .
where are you , proud propn ?
speak now .
here , villain , drawn and ready .
where are you ?
i ’ ll be right with you .
follow me , then , to a clear place .
you runaway , you coward , have you run away ?
speak .
are you hiding in some bush ?
where are you ?
you coward , are you bragging to the stars , telling the bushes that you look for wars , but will not fight one ?
come on , lazy loafer ; come on , you child ; i 'll whip you with a rod .
if someone else kills you , he will be cursed .
hey , are you there ?
follow my voice ; we wo n ’ t test your manhood here .
he went before me , and still dares me to fight ; when i get to where he ’ s calling from , he ’ s gone .
welcome , gentle day !
because , even if you only shine your grey light one time , i 'll find propn , and revenge this spite .
ho , ho , ho , ho !
propn , why do n ’ t you come ?
wait for me , if you dare ; because i know well that you are running before me , moving from place to place , not daring to stand still or look me in the face .
where are you ?
come over here ; i am here .
no , then , you are making fun of me .
oh weary night , oh long and tedious night , cut your hours short !
only three ?
come on , one more ; two boys and two girls makes up four .
i have never been so weary , never so sad , wet from the dew , and torn with briers ; i ca n ’ t crawl any further .
here i ’ ll rest until daybreak .
heavens shield propn , if they really mean to fight !
come , sit down on this flowery bed , while i play with your amiable cheeks , and stick musk - roses in your sleek smooth head , and kiss your fair large ears , my gentle joy .
where 's propn ?
ready .
ready .
propn propn ; good monsieur , get all your weapons in your hand and kill me a red - hipped humble - bee on the top of a thistle ; and , good monsieur , bring me his honey - bag .
ready .
give me your hand , propn propn .
i beg you , stop making curtsies , good sir .
what can i do for you ?
nothing , good sir , but for you to help propn propn scratch my head .
i have to get to the barber 's , sir , because i think i have an awful lot of hair on my face , and i am such a sensitive donkey , that i must scratch even if my hair only tickles me a little .
will you hear some music , my sweet love ?
i have a reasonable good musical ear ; let ’ s sing and dance .
or say , sweet love , what you desire to eat .
truly , a peck of dry food ; i could munch your good dry oats .
i think i have a great desire to a bottle of hay .
good hay , sweet hay , has no equal .
i have an adventurous fairy that shall seek what the squirrel has been hoarding , and get you new nuts .
i ’ d rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
but , i beg you , do n ’ t let any of your people wake me up ; i feel a deep sleep coming .
you sleep , and i will hold you in my arms .
fairies , be gone , and stay away .
i will put my arms around you just as the woodbine twists around the sweet honeysuckle , — like the female ivy propn around the branches of the elm .
oh , how i love you !
how i adore on you !
welcome , good propn .
do you see this sweet sight ?
she had put a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers all around his hairy face , and that same dew , which sometimes was accustomed to swell like round and orient pearls on the buds , was now within the pretty flowers ' eyes , like tears that were crying about their own sins .
when , at my pleasure , i had teased her , and she , calmly , begged my patience , i asked her for the indian child , which she gave me right away , and sent her fairy to carry him to my private place in fairy - land .
and now that i have the boy , i will undo this hateful spell that i have put on her eyes .
and , gentle propn , take this donkey head off the head of this athenian lover , that when he wakes when the others do , all of them may go back to propn , thinking no more about tonight ’ s events than that they were parts of a dream .
but first , i will release the fairy queen .
be as you are accustomed to being ; see as you are accustomed to seeing .
the bud from the propn - propn plant has such force and blessed power over propn 's flower .
now , my propn , wake up , my sweet queen .
my propn !
what visions have i seen !
i thought i was in love with a donkey .
your “ love ” is lying there .
how did all this happen ?
quiet for awhile .— robin , take off this head .
propn , call for music , and strike the senses of all these five so that they seem more dead than sleeping .
now when you awake , see with yours own fool 's eyes .
sound , music .
come , my queen , hold hands with me , and rock the ground where these sleepers are .
now you and i have a new friendship , and will solemnly dance propn propn propn ' house triumphantly , tomorrow at midnight and bless it for all fair prosperity .
there the pairs of faithful lovers shall be married , with propn , all in jollity .
fairy king , see and listen ; i do hear the morning lark .
then , my queen , in sad silence , we dance after night 's darkness .
we go around the globe , propn than the wandering moon .
come , my lord ; and , as we fly , tell me how it happened this night that i was found here sleeping on the ground with these mortals .
i never heard such gallant scolding ; because , besides the groves , the skies , the fountains , every region near seemed to have one mutual cry .
i never heard so musical a noise , such sweet thunder .
my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so jawed , so sandy - colored , and their heads are hung with ears that sweep along the ground ; propn - kneed and dew - covered like propn bulls ; slow in pursuit , but matched in their barks like bells , each one under the other .
a cry more tuneable was never called to , or cheered with a horn , in propn , in propn , or in propn .
my lord , this is my daughter here asleep ; and this propn ; this propn is ; this propn , old propn 's propn .
i wonder why they are here together .
it is , my lord .
go , bid the huntsmen wake them up by blowing the horns .
good morning , friends .
propn propn ’ s propn is past ; do these forest - birds begin only now to make a couple ?
propn , my lord .
i beg you all , stand up .
i know you two are rival enemies ; how does this gentle concord in the world come about , that hatred is so far from jealousy that you can sleep without fear ?
our intention was to be gone from propn , and to get to a place where we might be together without the propn of the athenian law .
my lord , fair propn told me of their running away , and why they ran here to this forest ; and in fury , i followed them here , propn propn , in love , following me .
i was engaged to her , my lord , before i saw propn .
but , like a sickness , i hated the taste this food ; but , now healthy , my natural tastes restored , now i wish it , love it , long for it , and will for evermore be true to it .
fair lovers , it ’ s good that we found you here .
we will hear more of this story later.— propn , i will override your demands ; these couples shall eternally be knit by and by with us in the temple .
these things seem small and murky , like far - off mountain tops turned into clouds .
i think i see these things with unfocused eyes , as when every thing seems double .
yes , and my father .
and propn .
and he did bid us to follow him to the temple , did n ’ t he ?
when my cue comes , call me , and i will answer .
my next is ' most fair propn .
heigh - ho ! —peter quince !
flute , the bellows - mender !
snout , the tinker !
starveling !
oh my propn , they have run away and left me asleep !
i have had a most rare vision .
i have had a dream— it ’ s beyond the smartest man to say what kind of dream it was .— man is only a donkey if he goes about to telling this dream .
i thought i was — there is no man can tell what .
i thought i was , and i thought i had , — but a man is only a mended fool , if he will offer to say what i thought i had .
the eye of man has not heard , the ear of man has not seen ; man 's hand is not able to taste , his tongue to conceive , or his heart to report , what my dream was .
i will get propn propn to write a ballad of this dream .
it shall be called propn 's dream , because it has no bottom ; and i will sing it in the latter end of a play , before the duke .
perhaps , to make it the more gracious , i shall sing it at her death .
have you sent someone to propn 's house ?
has he come home yet ?
no one has heard anything about him .
no doubt , he ’ s kidnapped .
if he does n ’ t come , then the play is incomplete ; it does n ’ t go on , does it ?
it ’ s not possible .
there ’ s not a man in all propn able to play propn but he .
no , he has simply the best wit of any working man in propn .
you must say “ paragon . ” a “ paramour ” is , propn bless us , a thing of nothing .
sirs , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there are two or three lords and ladies more married .
if our play had gone forward , we would ’ ve all been made men .
oh sweet bully bottom !
six cents a - day in propn , or nothing .
where are these lads ?
where are these hearts ?
propn most courageous day !
oh most happy hour !
i will tell you everything , just as it happened .
let ’ s hear it , sweet bottom .
not a word from me .
all that i will tell you is , that the duke has dined .
get your costumes together ; good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your shoes ; meet presently at the palace ; every man look over his part ; for the short and the long of it is , they want to see our play .
in any case , let propn have clean linen ; and do n ’ t let him that plays the lion cut his nails , because they shall hang out for the lion 's claws .
and , most dear actors , do n ’ t eat any onions nor garlic , because we are to utter our lines with sweet breath ; and i do n ’ t doubt that we will hear them say it is a sweet comedy .
no more words .
it ’ s strange , my propn , the story that these lovers speak of .
more strange than true .
i never may believe these antique fables , or these fairy toys .
lovers and madmen have such busy brains , such ability to shape fantasies , that they catch more than cool reason ever understands .
the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are all compact in their imagination .
one sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; that is the madman .
the lover , just as crazy , sees propn of propn 's beauty in an propn .
the poet 's eye , rolling in a fine frenzy , propn from propn to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination sends out the forms of things unknown , the poet 's pen turns them to shapes , and gives a local place and a name to airy nothing .
such tricks have strong imagination , that , if it would only catch some joy , it understands some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush thought to be a bear ?
but the whole story of the night told over , and all their minds changed all at the same time , shows more witnesses than just images of the mind , and grows to something of great lasting ; but , nevertheless , strange and admirable .
here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth.— propn , gentle friends !
propn and fresh days of love propn your hearts !
more than you wish for us propn in your royal walks , your board , your bed !
come now ; what plays , what dances shall we have , to pass the three hours between our after - supper and bed - time ?
where is our usual manager of mirth ?
what revels are in store ?
is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ?
propn propn .
say , what entertainment do you have for this evening ?
what play ?
what music ?
how shall we spend the lazy time , if not with some delight ?
there is a brief list of how many events there are ; make choice of which your highness will see first .
tedious and brief !
that ’ s like hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
how shall we find the concord of this discord ?
a play there is , my lord , some ten words long , which is as brief as i have known a play ; but by ten words , my lord , it is too long , which makes it tedious , because , in all the play there is not one appropriate word , one player a good actor .
who are they that do play it ?
hard working men that work here in propn , who never worked in their minds until now , and now they have toiled their bad memories to do this play in honor of your wedding .
and we ’ ll hear it .
no , my noble lord , it is not for you .
i ’ ve heard , and it is nothing , nothing in the world , unless you can laugh at their intentions , extremely stretched and done with cruel pain , to do you service .
i will hear that play , because nothing can ever be wrong when simpleness and duty give it freely .
i do n ’ t like to see misery over - played , and duty dying in his service .
why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
he says they ca n ’ t do anything like this .
that makes us kinder , to give them thanks for nothing .
and what poor duty ca n ’ t do , noble respect takes it in force , not merit .
in places i go to , great clerks have purposed to greet me with prepared welcomes ; i have seen them shiver and look pale , make full stops in the middle of sentences , mess up their practiced speeches in their fears , and , in conclusion , stop all together , dumbstruck , not paying me a welcome .
trust me , sweet , out of this silence , i still picked out a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty , i can understand as much as if it were from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence .
love , therefore , and tongue - tied simplicity speaking the least means most to me .
so please your grace , the prologue is next .
let him approach .
if we offend you , it is with our good will .
but you should think that we do n ’ t come to offend , but with good will .
to show our simple skill , that is the true beginning of our end .
consider then that we come but in scorn .
we do n ’ t come , as we mean to content you , is our true intent .
all for your delight we are not here .
he has ridden his prologue like a rough colt .
indeed he has played on this prologue like a child on a recorder , a sound , but not in order .
his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered .
who ’ s next ?
propn , perhaps you wonder at this show ; but wonder on until the truth makes all things clear .
this man is propn , if you want to know ; this beauteous lady is certainly propn .
this man , with lantern , dog , and thorn bush , propn propn , because , if you want to know , these lovers think it ’ s no shame to meet at propn ' tomb by moonshine , there , there to court each other .
this grisly beast , which known by name propn , scared away or rather frightened the trusty propn , coming first to the place by night ; and as she fled , she dropped her shawl , which vile propn stained with his bloody mouth .
for all the rest , let propn , propn , propn , and the two lovers , tell you while they stay here .
i wonder if the lion is going to speak .
do you need lime and hair to speak better ?
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard speak , my lord .
propn draws near the wall ; silence .
oh grim - looked night !
oh night with hue so black !
oh night , which ever is when day is not !
thanks , courteous wall .
jove protect you well for this !
but what see what see i ?
i do n ’ t see propn .
oh wicked wall , through whom i see no bliss , cursed be your stones for deceiving me like this !
the wall , i think , being sensible , should curse again .
no , in truth , sir , he should not .
deceiving me ” is propn 's cue .
she is to enter now , and i am to spy her through the wall .
you shall see it will fall right just as i told you .— she comes from over there .
oh wall , you have heard my moans very often , for separating my fair propn and me .
i see a voice ; now i ’ ll go to the chink , to spy if i can hear my propn 's face .
thisbe !
my love !
you are my love , i think .
think what you will , i am your lover 's grace ; and like propn , i am still trusty .
and i ’ m like propn , until the fates kill me .
not propn to propn was so true .
as propn to propn , i am to you .
oh , kiss me through the hole of this vile wall .
i kiss the wall 's hole , not your lips at all .
will you meet me straightway at propn 's tomb ?
fighting life , fighting death , i come without delay .
so i , wall , have discharged my part ; and , being done , propn goes away like this .
now is the wall down between the two neighbors .
no remedy , my lord , when walls are so willful to hear without warning .
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard .
the best plays are only shadows , and the worst are no worse , if imagination can fill in the gaps .
it must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
if we imagine no worse of them than they imagine of themselves , they may pass for excellent men .
here come two noble beasts , a moon and a lion .
you , ladies , you , whose gentle hearts fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor , may now , perhaps , both quake and tremble here , when a rough lion roars in wildest rage .
a very gentle beast , and of a good conscience .
the very best at a beast , my lord , that ever i saw .
this lion is a very fox for his courage .
true and a goose for his secret - keeping .
not so , my lord , because his courage can not carry his secret - keeping , but the fox carries the goose .
his secret - keeping , i am sure , can not carry his courage , because the goose can not carry the fox .
he is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circle .
this lantern represents the horned moon ; i myself seem to be the man in the moon .
how else is it the man in the moon ?
he does n ’ t dare come there for the candle , because you see , it ’ s already out .
i am weary of this moon .
i wish he would change !
it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is growing dark , but still , politely , in all reason , we must pass the time .
propn , moon .
all that i have to say , is to tell you that the lantern is the moon ; i , the man in the moon ; this thorn - bush , my thorn - bush ; and this dog , my dog .
why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon .
but silence ; here comes propn .
this is old propn 's tomb .
where is my love ?
well run , propn .
well moused , lion .
and here comes propn .
and then the lion vanishes .
but stay ; — oh spite !
but mark , — poor knight , what dreadful sorrow is here !
eyes , do you see ?
how can it be ?
oh dainty duck !
oh dear !
your shawl good , what !
stained with blood ?
approach , you vicious fates !
oh fates !
come , come ; cut thread and thrum ; propn , rush , conclude , and quell !
this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go far in making a man look sad .
curse my heart , but i pity the man .
oh why , nature , did you make lions ?
since the vile lion vile has here taken my dear ; which is — no , no — which was the fairest dame that lived , that loved , that liked , that looked with cheer .
come , tears , confound ; out , sword , and wound the pap ( heart ) of propn .
ay , that left pap , where the heart beats.— thus die i , thus , thus , thus .
now am i dead , now am i fled ; my soul is in the sky .
now die , die , die , die , die .
no die , but an ace , for him , because he is only one .
less than an ace , man ; for he is dead ; he is nothing .
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove a donkey .
how is it that moonshine is gone before propn comes back and finds her lover ?
a particle of dust will turn the balance , which propn , which propn , is the better .
she has already seen him with those sweet eyes .
and thus she moans , that is to propn propn , my love ?
what , dead , my dove ?
oh propn , arise , speak , speak .
quite dumb ?
dead , dead ?
a tomb must cover your sweet eyes .
oh propn three , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk ; lay them in gore , since you have shore with shears his thread of silk .
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead .
ay , and wall too .
no , i assure you ; the wall is down that parted their fathers .
will it please you to see the epilogue , or to hear an italian country dance between two of our company ?
no epilogue , i beg you , because your play needs no excuse .
never excuse , for when the players are all dead , there ’ s no one to be blamed .
propn , if he who wrote the play had played propn , and hanged himself in propn 's garter , it would have been a fine tragedy .
and so it is , truly ; and very notably acted .
but come , your italian country dance ; forget your epilogue .
i ’ m afraid we shall oversleep in the morning , as much as we stayed up late this night .
as you go through the house , use the dead and drowsy fire to give glimmering light , every elf and fairy spirit propn as lightly as bird hops from a thorn : and sing this little song , following me , and dance it as you sing it .
now , until dawn , each fairy wander through this house .
we will go to the best marriage - bed , which shall be blessed by us ; and the children created there propn forever be lucky and prosperous .
dance away : do n ’ t delay : all of you meet me by dawn .
if we actors have offended you , think about this , -- and everything will be all right , -- you have only dozed off here while these visions appeared .
and this weak and idle play about love , does n ’ t mean any more than a dream .
so , good night to you all .
let ’ s have your applause , if we are friends , and propn shall make good on his promise .
rubbish !
do n ’ t tell me ; i do n ’ t like it at all that you , propn , who has used my purse as if the strings were yours , should know about this .
but you ’ re not listening to me .
if i ever dreamt about such a matter , hate me .
you told me you hated him .
despise me , if i do n ’ t .
truly , a great arithmetician , one propn propn , a propn , a fellow almost damned in a having a beautiful wife ; that has never led a squadron in the field , and does n ’ t know the division of a battle any more than a spinster does , unless the theory books , in which the consuls wearing togas can propose a plan as masterly as he can .
by propn , i would rather have been his hangman .
why , there 's no remedy ; it is the curse of the military .
preference goes by who you know and who likes you , and not by old system , where each second person took the first ’ s place .
now , sir , judge it for yourself whether or i am better suited in any beautiful terms to love the propn .
i would n ’ t follow him then .
you shall see many a duteous and knee - bending rogue that , doting on his own obedient slavery , wears himself out , much like his master 's ass , for nothing but dry oats ; and when he 's old , dismissed from the service .
i would whip such honest rogues .
there are others who , dressed in uniforms and faces of duty , that keep their hearts attending on themselves ; and , throwing only shows of service to their lords , propn well by them , and when they have lined their coats , do themselves homage .
these fellows have some soul ; and someone like that is how i am .
because , sir , it is as sure as you are propn , were i the propn , i would not be propn .
what great luck the thick lips have , if he can get away with this !
even if his joy is joy , still throw such aggravation on it that he wo n ’ t stay happy for long .
go ahead ; yell with frightening accent and distress as when a fire is seen in big cities at night and by accident .
what , ho , propn !
propn propn , ho !
propn !
what , ho , propn !
thieves !
thieves !
thieves !
look at your house , your daughter , and your bags !
thieves !
thieves !
what is the reason for this terrible summons ?
what ’ s the matter there ?
propn , is your family all inside ?
are your doors locked ?
get up , i say .
what , have you lost your wits ?
very reverend propn , do you know my voice ?
no , who are you ?
my name is propn .
the worst welcome .
i have ordered you not to hang around my doors ; in honest plainness , you have heard me say my daughter is not for you , and now , in madness , being full of supper and drunk , you come , out of maliciousness to interrupt my sleep .
propn , sir , sir , but you must certainly be sure that my spirit and my place have power in them to make this bitter to you .
patience , good sir .
why are you telling me about robbing ?
this is propn ; my house is not a farm .
very grave propn , i come to you in simple and pure soul .
zounds , sir , you are one of those who would n ’ t serve propn if the devil asked you to .
because we are servants , and you think we are ruffians , you 'd have your daughter covered with a african horse ; you 'd have your nephews neigh to you ; you 'd have chargers for cousins and small spanish horses for propn .
who the hell are you ?
i am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the propn are now making a propn .
you are a villain .
you are a senator .
propn , i will answer anything .
give me a candle !
wake up all my servants !
farewell ; because i must leave you .
it does n ’ t seem right or suitable to my position to be a witness ( which i will be if i stay ) , against the propn .
because i know the government , no matter how angry this makes propn with some propn , can not arrest him safely ; because he 's embarked with such loud reason to the propn wars , which is being discussed even now , that , to save their souls , they have no one of his depth to lead their armies , in which regard , although i hate him as i hate hell pains , i must still show a flag and sign of love , to preserve my present life , which is indeed only sign .
so that you shall surely find him , lead these searchers to the propn propn , and i will be there with him .
so , farewell .
how did you know it was she ?
get more propn ; wake up all my relatives .
do you think they ’ re married ?
truly , i think they are .
how did she get out ?
o treason of the blood !
fathers , from now on do n ’ t believe you can know your daughters ' minds from the way you see them act .
have n ’ t you read , propn , of some such thing ?
yes , sir , i have indeed .
call my brother .
do you know where we may catch her and the propn ?
i think i can find him , if you ’ d please get a good guard , and go along with me .
i beg you , lead on .
although i have slain men during a war , i believe it is a grave matter of the conscience to do a premeditated murder .
i do n ’ t have evil in me sometimes to do me service .
nine or ten times i had thought to have stabbed him here under the ribs .
it is better as it is .
no , but he chattered on , and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor , that , with the little godliness i have , i worked hard to tolerate him .
but , i beg you , sir , are you really married ?
be assured of this , that the magnifico is very popular ; and has , in his office , a voice equal to twice the duke 's .
he will divorce you ; or apply to you what restraint and grievance the law will allow him to do , with all his might to do it .
let him do his worse .
my services that i have done for the signiory propn out - shout his complaints .
but , look !
what lights are coming ?
those are the awakened father and his friends .
you had better go in .
is it they ?
by propn , i do n ’ t think so .
the goodness of the night on you , friends !
what ’ s the news ?
the duke greets you , general ; and he requires your super - speedy appearance this instant .
what ’ s the matter , do you think ?
the galleys have sent a dozen sequential messengers this very night at one another 's heels ; and many of the consuls , awakened and meeting , are at the duke 's already .
you have been hotly called for ; when , you were n ’ t found at your lodging , the senate sent about three different requests to search for you .
it is good that you found me .
i will only say one more word here in the house , and i ’ ll go with you .
propn , what is he doing here ?
i do n ’ t understand .
he 's married .
to whom ?
by propn , to … come , captain , will you go ?
let ’ s go .
here comes another group to see for you .
general , be careful ; he comes with bad intentions .
stop !
stop there !
propn , it is the propn .
you , propn !
come , sir , i will fight you .
o you foul thief , where have you hidden my daughter ?
damned as you are , you have cast a spell on her ; because i 'll restore myself to all things of sense , if she was n ’ t bound in chains of magic , would a maid so tender , beautiful , and happy , so opposed to marriage that she shunned the wealthy , curled darlings of our country , would she ever have , to merit a public joke , run from her father to the black bosom of a thing such as you , to fear , not to delight in ?
i therefore arrest and attack you as an abuser of the world , a practitioner of the forbidden and illegal arts .
if he resists , propn him at his peril .
to prison until the right time of law and course of justice call you to answer .
what if i obey ?
how may the duke be satisfied with that , whose messengers are here by my side , on some urgent business of the state , to bring me to him ?
it is true , very worthy propn ; the duke 's in council , and your noble self , i am sure , is sent for .
what !
the duke in council !
the duke himself , or any of my brothers of the state , can only feel this wrong as if it were their own ; because if such actions may have passage free , bond slaves and pagans shall be our statesmen .
there is no written in this news that makes them believable .
indeed , they are out of proportion ; my letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
and mine a hundred and forty .
and mine two hundred .
what , ho !
what , ho !
what , ho !
a messenger from the galleys .
now , what 's the latest ?
the turkish armies are headed for propn ; so i was asked to report here to the state by propn propn .
what do you say about this change ?
no , in all confidence , the propn are not going to propn .
here is more news .
the propn , reverend and gracious , steering with due course toward the isle of propn , have joined a later fleet there with them .
yes , so i thought .
how many , do you guess ?
propn propn , your trusty and very valiant servant , salutes you like this , with his free duty , and begs you to believe him .
it is certain , then , for propn .
propn propn , is n ’ t he in town ?
he 's now in propn .
write to him from us ; send it very , very quickly .
here comes propn and the valiant propn .
propn propn , we must straight send you against the general enemy propn .
i did n ’ t see you ; welcome , gentle propn ; we missed your advice and your help tonight .
and i missed yours .
why , what 's the matter ?
my daughter !
o , my daughter !
dead ?
whoever he is that , in this disgusting event , has tricked your daughter of herself like this , and you of her , the bloody book of law you shall read yourself to the bitter letter of it as you see fit .
humbly i thank your grace .
here is the man , this propn ; who now , it seems , has been brought here by your special mandate for the state affairs .
we are very sorry for it .
what , in your own part , can you say to this ?
nothing , but that this is so .
very potent , grave , and reverend signiors , my very noble and approved good masters , that i have taken away this old man 's daughter , is very true ; true , i have married her .
i do n ’ t speak well , and i am little blessed with the soft phrase of peace because , since these arms of mine were seven years ' old , until now some nine months past , they have used their dearest actions on the battlefield ; and i can speak little of this great world , only what relates to feats of war and battle ; and therefore i shall grace my cause little by speaking for myself .
yet , by your gracious patience , i will deliver a round truthful tale of my whole course of love , by what drugs , what charms , what invocation , and what mighty magic , because i am charged with such crimes , i won his daughter .
a maiden never bold , of a spirit so still and quiet that she blushed at her own propn ; and she , in spite of nature , of years , of country , reputation , everything , to fall in love with what she feared to look at !
i therefore testify again , that he worked on her with some mixtures powerful over the blood , or with some dram that produced this effect .
to testify is not proof , without wider and more open tests than these thin habits and poor probabilities of modern liking prefer against him .
but , propn , speak .
did you , by indirect and forced methods , propn and poison this young maid 's affections ?
or did she ask for them , with such a beautiful question as soul to soul allows ?
fetch propn here .
propn , go with them ; you know the place best .
and , until she comes , as truly as i confess the vices of my blood to propn , so i 'll present truthfully , to your hearing , how i thrived in this beautiful lady 's love , and she in mine .
tell it , propn .
her father loved me , often invited me ; still questioned me the story of my life , from year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , that i have been in .
to hear this , propn would seriously listen , but still the house affairs would draw her away , which she would finish in a great hurry , and she ’ d come again , and eat up my stories with a greedy ear , which i observing , once i took a rare hour ; and found good ways to draw a prayer of earnest enthusiasm from her so that i would lengthen all my stories , which she had already heard bits and pieces of , but not all of them .
i agreed and often i cheated her of her tears , when i spoke of some distressful event i had suffered in my youth .
this is the only witchcraft i have used .
here comes the lady ; let her verify it .
i think this tale would win my daughter too .
my noble father , i see a divided duty here .
to you i am bound for my life and education ; my life and education both teach me how to respect you ; you are the lord of duty , i am therefore your daughter .
but here 's my husband ; and as much duty as my mother showed to you , preferring you before her father , so much i dispute that i may profess due to the propn , my lord .
propn be with you !
i ’ m done .
for your sake , jewel , i am glad at soul i have no other child , because your escape would teach me tyranny , to hang logs on them .
i ’ m done , my lord .
let me speak as you would ; and lay a sentence which , as a grace or step , may help these lovers into your favor .
when remedies are too late , griefs are ended by seeing the worst , which hopes lately depended on .
to mourn mischief that is over and gone is the next way to create new mischief .
what can not be preserved when fortune takes it , propn makes a mockery of her injury .
the victim that smiles steals something from the thief ; he robs himself that spends a unprofitable grief .
these sentences , to sweetness or to bitterness , being strong on both sides , are equal .
i humbly beg you , proceed to the affairs of state .
the propn with very mighty preparation makes for propn .
othello , the strength of the place is best known to you ; and although we have there a force that is more than adequate , yet public opinion , a sovereign mistress of effects , say we need a safer voice , like you .
you must therefore be content to conceal the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and violent expedition .
the dictator , custom , very grave senators , has made the stone and steel couch of war my feather bed three times .
i recognize a natural and prompt speed that i find in hardness , and undertake these present wars against the propn .
very humbly , therefore , bowing to your state , i ’ d like proper provisions for my wife , propn respect for housing and subsidy , with such accommodation and suitable company as is equal with her breeding .
nor i .
nor i. i would not live there , to put my father into violent thoughts , by being always in his sight .
very gracious duke , listen with a gracious ear to my request , and let me find a contract in your voice to assist my simpleness .
what would you have , propn ?
that i loved the propn to live with him , my downright violence and storm of fortunes may shout to the world .
so much so , dear lords , if i am left behind , a moth of peace , and he goes to the war , the rites for which i love him i am deprived of , and i shall endure a sad interval caused by his dear absence .
let me go with him .
let her have your votes .
no , when light - winged toys of feathered propn blind my knowing and usual instruments of sight with unruly dullness , that if my games corrupt and stain my work , let housewives make a skillet of my helmet , and all indignities and base adversities make a boil of my reputation !
tonight , my lord ?
this night .
with all my heart .
at nine in the morning , we 'll meet here again .
othello , leave some officer behind , and he shall bring our commission to you , with such things of quality and respect as are important to you .
let it be so .
good night to everyone .
and , noble propn , if virtue is missing delightful beauty , your son - in - law is far more just than black .
goodbye , brave propn ; be kind to propn .
my life on her faith in me !
iago ?
what do you say , noble heart ?
what will i do , do you think ?
why , go to bed and sleep .
i will drown myself immediately .
if you do , i shall never love you after .
why , you silly gentleman !
it is silliness to live when to live is torment ; and then we have a prescription to die when death is our physician .
o villainous !
i have looked on the world for twenty eight years , and since i could distinguish between a benefit and a disadvantage , i ’ ve never found man that knew how to love himself .
before i would say i would drown myself for the love of a chicken , i would exchange my humanity with a baboon .
what should i do ?
i confess it is my shame to be so crazy in love , but it is not in my virtue to fix it .
virtue !
a fig !
it is in ourselves that we are like this or like that .
if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to balance another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would lead us to very preposterous conclusions .
it can not be .
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
come , be a man .
drown yourself !
drown cats and blind puppies .
put money in your purse ; follow the wars ; defeat your mood with an false beard ; i say , put money in your purse .
it had a violent beginning , and you shall see an answerable separation— put only money in your purse .— these moors are changeable in their wills .
fill your purse with money .
the food that is now as luscious as locusts to him shall be shortly be as bitter as the bitter apple drug .
if you must damn yourself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
a pox on drowning yourself !
it is clean out of the way .
rather seek to be hanged in planning your joy than to be drowned and go without her .
will you be committed to my hopes , if i depend on you ?
i have told you often , and i ’ ll tell you again and again , i hate the propn .
my cause is fixed in my heart ; yours has no less reason .
let us be united in our revenge against him .
if you can get his wife , you do yourself a pleasure , me a sport .
there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered .
go ahead ; go ; provide your money .
we will talk about this more of this tomorrow .
goodbye .
where shall we meet in the morning ?
at my lodging .
i 'll be with you soon .
go to ; farewell .
do you hear me , propn ?
what did you say ?
no more about drowning , do you hear ?
this is the way i ever make my fool my purse ; because i should abuse my own gained knowledge if i would waste time with such a fool only for my sport and profit .
i hate the propn ; and it is widely thought that he has done my job between my sheets .
i do n ’ t know if it is true ; but i will take it as a certainty just because of mere propn in that way .
he trusts me well , the better my plan will work on him .
propn 's a proper man .
let me see now , to get his place , and to congratulate myself in double trickery , how , how ?
he has a person , and a smooth disposition , to be suspected , framed to make women lie .
the propn is of a free and open nature , that thinks men are honest that only seem to be so ; and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are .
i have it !
it is born .
hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world 's light .
what can you discern at sea from the cape ?
nothing at all .
it is a very excited flood ; i can not , between the sky and the land , see a sail .
what shall we hear of this ?
if the turkish fleet is not sheltered and in a bay , they are drowned ; it is impossible to wait it out .
news , lads !
our wars are over .
how !
is this true ?
i am glad of it .
he is a worthy governor but this same propn , although he speaks of comfort touching the turkish loss , he still looks sad , and prays the propn is safe , because they were parted with an evil and violent tempest .
pray heavens he is , because i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier .
come , let 's do so , because every minute is to expect more arrival .
thank you , the valiant of this warlike isle , that so approve the propn !
o , let the heavens give him defense against the elements , because i have lost him on a dangerous sea !
does he have a good ship ?
his ship is heavily timbered , and his captain is very experienced and has a good reputation ; therefore my hopes , not excessively fed to death , stand in heavy anxiety .
a sail , a sail , a sail !
what noise ?
the town is empty ; on the seashore ranks of people stand , and they cry , `` a sail !
i beg you , sir , go outside , and give us truth about who it is that has arrived .
i shall .
but , good lieutenant , is your general married ?
how now !
who has put in ?
it is one propn , ensign to the general .
who is she ?
she that i spoke of , our great captain 's captain , left in the company of the bold propn , whose footing here occurs earlier than the seven nights we thought it would take .
propn propn , guard othello , and swell his sail with your own powerful breath , that he may bless this bay with his tall ship , make love 's quick breaths in propn 's arms , give renewed fire to our dead spirits , and bring all propn comfort !
o , behold , the riches of the ship is come on shore !
you men of propn , bend your knees .
hall to you , lady !
and the grace of propn , before you , behind you , and on every hand , surround you !
i thank you , valiant propn .
what news can you tell me of my lord ?
he is not yet arrived and i do n ’ t know anything only that he 's well , and will be here shortly .
o , but i fear how lost you each other ?
the great fight of the sea and skies separated our fellowship .
a sail .
look for the news .
good ensign , you are welcome .
welcome , mistress .
propn , i wish she would give you as much of her lips as she often gives me of her tongu . , you 'd have enough .
alas , she has nothing to say .
by propn , before your ladyship , i grant , she puts her voice a little in her heart , and scolds by thinking .
you do n ’ t have reasonto say so .
o , damn you , slanderer !
you shall not write my praise .
no , do n ’ t let me .
what would you write about me , if you should praise me ?
o gentle lady , do n ’ t ask me , because i am nothing if not critical .
yes , madam .
i am not merry ; but i cheat the thing i am by seeming otherwise .
come , how would you praise me ?
i am about it ; but , indeed , my imagination comes from my head as bird trap does from cloth , it plucks out brains and all .
but my inspiration works , and she is delivered like this .
if she is beautiful and wise , beauty and wit , the one 's for use , the other uses it .
well praised !
what if she is black and witty ?
if she is black and also has a wit , she 'll find a white that will her blackness fit .
worse and worse .
what if she is beautiful and foolish ?
she never was still foolish that was beautiful , because even her folly helped her have an heir .
these are old wives ’ tales to make fools laugh in the alehouse .
what miserable praise have you for her that 's ugly and foolish ?
you praise the worst best .
but what praise could you bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that , in the authority of her merit , rightly wore the witnessing of very malice itself ?
to breastfeed fools and make a record of a little beer .
o very lame and powerless conclusion !
do n ’ t learn from him , propn , although he is your husband .
what do you think , propn ?
is n ’ t he a very unholy and rude counselor ?
he speaks freely , madam .
you may appreciate him more as a soldier than as a scholar .
with a web as little as this , i ’ ll catch as big a fly as propn .
yes , go ahead and smile on her ; i will trap you in your own courtship .
you speak truly ; it is so , indeed .
if such tricks as these strip you of your lieutenantry , it would ’ ve been better you had n ’ t kissed your three fingers so often , with which you are again very ready to play the gent .
an excellent courtesy !
it is so , indeed .
still your fingers to your lips again ?
i wish they were hypodermics for your sake !
the propn !
i know his trumpet .
it is truly so .
let 's meet him and greet him .
look , where he is coming !
o my beautiful warrior !
my dear othello !
it surprises me as much as my joy to see you here before me .
o my soul 's joy !
if , after every storm such calms come , may the winds blow until they have awakened death !
and let the laboring ship climb hills of oceans as high as propn , and duck down again as low as hell is from propn !
if i were to die now , i could die very happy ; because , i ’ m afraid , my soul is so absolutely content , that no other comfort like this one can follow unknown death .
the heavens forbid anything but our loves and comforts should increase even as our days grow long !
amen to that , sweet powers !
i can not speak enough of this contentment ; it stops me here ; it is too joyful .
o , you are well tuned now !
but i 'll tighten the strings that make this music , until it ’ s as honest as i am .
come , let ’ s go to the castle .
news , friends ; our wars are done , the propn are drowned .
propn , propn will be very glad to see you ; i have found great love among them .
o my sweet , i chit - chat unfashionably , and i talk foolishly about my own comforts .
come , propn , once more happily brought to propn .
meet me right away at the harbor .
come here .
if you are valiant , as , they say , corrupt men being in love have a nobility in their natures that is more than natural to them , listen to me .
the lieutenant is part of the court ’ s guard tonight .
first , i must tell you this propn is directly in love with him .
with him !
why , it is not possible .
lay your finger like this , and let your soul be instructed .
watch with what violence she first loved the propn , but with his bragging , and telling her fantastic lies .
will she still love him for chattering ?
do n ’ t your discreet heart think it .
her eye must be fed , and what joy will she have to look on the devil ?
when the blood is made calm with playing , there should be something to fire it up again and to satisfy a fresh appetite , loveliness in favor ; sympathy in years , manners , and beauties , all which the propn lacks .
now sir , this done , as it is a very compelling and natural position , who is outstanding and first in the degree of this luck as propn is ?
a very changeable rogue , having no further conscience than assuming the mere form of civil and humane behavior , for the better measure of his worth and very hidden loose affections ?
i can not believe that in her ; she is full of very blessed qualities .
blessed my foot !
she drinks wine just like everyone else .
if she had been blessed , she would never have loved the propn .
blessed pudding !
did n ’ t you see her play with the palm of his hand ?
did n ’ t you see that ?
yes , i did ; but she was only being polite .
i swear it ’ s a habitual lust , a list and hidden opening to the history of lust and evil thoughts .
they came so close with their lips that their breaths hugged each other .
villainous thoughts , propn !
when these mutual things lead the way , the teacher and the main exercise follow close behind , to the obvious conclusion .
piss off !
but , sir , take my advice .
i have brought you from propn .
propn does n ’ t know you .
i wo n ’ t be far from you .
find some occasion to make propn angry , either by speaking too loud , or insulting his discipline , or from whatever reason you please , which might be suggested by what ’ s happening at the time .
provoke him so that he will ; because even out of that , i will make these men of propn rebel , whose character wo n ’ t come back to their original calmness unless propn is replaced .
so you shall have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i would now have to advance them ; and the impediment very profitably removed , without which we could n ’ t expect to succeed .
i guarantee you .
meet me later at the fortress .
i must get his belongings ashore .
propn .
goodbye .
it is propn 's pleasure , our noble and valiant general , that on certain news now arrived , concerning the mere total destruction of the turkish fleet , every man rejoice , some to dance , some to make bonfires , each man to whatever sport and revels his disposition leads him , because , besides this good news , it is the celebration of his wedding .
his pleasure should be proclaimed this much .
all offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five until the clock rings eleven .
propn bless the isle of propn and our noble general othello !
propn has orders on what to do ; but , nevertheless , with my own eyes i will look to it myself .
propn is very honest .
propn , good night .
tomorrow , at your earliest , let me speak with you .
come , my dear love , the purchase made , the fruits are to follow , that profit is still to come between me and you .
good - night .
welcome , iago ; we must go to the guard .
not this hour , lieutenant ; it is not yet ten of the clock .
our general put us early like this for the love of his propn , whom we wo n ’ t blame .
he has n ’ t yet spent the wedding night with her ; and she is joy for the gods .
she 's a very exquisite lady .
and , i 'll guarantee that she is full of game .
indeed , she is a very fresh and delicate creature .
what an eye she has !
i think it looks like an invitation to excitement .
an inviting eye , and still i think it is properly modest .
and when she speaks , is n ’ t it a call to love ?
she is , indeed , perfection .
well , happiness to their sheets !
come , lieutenant , i have a bottle of wine ; and here outside are a number of propn gents that would happily drink a round to the health of black othello .
i could really wish manners would invent some other kind of entertainment .
o , they are our friends , only one cup .
i 'll drink for you .
i have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily diluted too , and behold , what changes it makes here .
i am unfortunate in the handicap , and dare not tempt my weakness with any more wine .
what , man !
where are they ?
here at the door ; i beg you , call them in .
i 'll do it , but it does n ’ t like me .
if i can get him to drink only one cup , with the one he ’ s already drunk tonight , he 'll be as full of fighting and insults as my young mistress ' dog .
now , among this flock of drunkards , i am make our propn do some action that may offend the isle .
some wine , ho !
and let me the small drink clink , clink ; and let me the small drink clink .
before propn , an excellent song .
i learned it in propn , where , indeed , they are very powerful drinkers .
is your propn so expert in his drinking ?
why , he drinks your dane dead drunk easily ; he does n ’ t even sweat to defeat your german ; he makes your propn vomit before the next round can be poured .
to the health of our general !
propn propn was a worthy peer , his breeches only cost him a dollar ; he held them six cents all too expensive , with that he called the calm tailor .
will you hear it again ?
it 's true , good lieutenant .
for my own part , no offense to the general , nor any man of quality , i hope to be saved .
and so do i too , lieutenant .
let 's have no more of this ; let 's to our affairs .
forgive us our sins !
gentlemen , let 's look to our business .
i am not drunk now ; i can stand well enough , and i speak well enough .
excellent well .
and do n ’ t only see his vice ; it is a proper contradiction to his virtue , the one is as long as the other .
it ‘ s a pity of him .
i fear the trust propn puts him in , because at some odd time of his infirmity , he will shake this island .
but is he often like this ?
he 'll watch the clock all night if drink does n ’ t rock his cradle .
it would be good to let the general know about it .
hey , propn !
i pray you , go after the lieutenant .
what ’ s that noise ?
you rogue !
you rascal !
what 's the matter , lieutenant ?
a rogue teaching me my duty !
i 'll beat the rogue into a wicker bottle .
beat me !
no , good lieutenant ; i beg you , sir , stop .
let me go , sir , or i 'll knock you over the head .
come on , come on , you 're drunk .
drunk !
what is the matter here ?
zounds , i bleed still ; i am hurt to the death .
hold , for your lives !
lieutenant , -- sir , -- propn , -- gentlemen , -- have you forgot all place of sense and duty ?
hold !
why , how now , ho !
what started this ?
have we turned to propn , and do to ourselves what propn has forbidden the propn ?
what is the matter , gentlemen ?
propn propn , looking dead with grieving , speak , who began this ?
how is it , propn , that you have forgotten yourself ?
i beg you , pardon me ; i can not speak .
propn propn , you were inclined to be civil ; the world has marked he gravity and stillness of your youth and your name is great in mouths of wisest respect .
what 's the matter , that you destroy your reputation like this , and waste your reputation for the name of a night - brawler ?
answer me .
i do n ’ t know anything that i said or did wrong this night , unless self - love is sometimes a vice , and to defend ourselves is a sin when we are attacked violently .
now , by propn , my blood begins to rule my safer sense , and passion , having influenced my better judgment tries to lead the way .
if i once get angry , and only lift this arm , the best of you shall sink in my scolding .
let me know how this nasty fight began , who started it , and he that is guilty of this offense , even if he is my twin brother , both born at the same time , he ’ ll be finished with me .
what !
in a town of war still waging , the people 's hearts brimful of fear , to control private and domestic quarrels , at night , and on the court and guard of safety !
it is monstrous .
propn , who started it ?
if partially connected or together in office , you deliver more or less than truth , you are no soldier .
i ’ d rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to propn propn ; still , i convince myself , speaking the truth shall not wrong him .
it ’ s like this , general .
propn and myself were talking , and there comes a fellow crying out for help , with propn following him with determined sword , to kill him .
he , fast of foot , propn me ; and i returned because that i heard the clink and fall of swords , and propn swearing loudly ; which , until tonight , i never saw him do before .
when i came back , for this was brief , -- i found them close together , everyone was fighting , even as again they were when you yourself parted them .
i ca n ’ t report more of this matter , but men are men ; the best sometimes forget themselves .
propn propn did only little wrong to him , as men in rage strike those that wish them best , yet surely propn , i believe , received some strange insult from him that fled , which patience could not let him get away with .
i know , propn , your honesty and love minimize this matter , making it easier for propn .
propn , i love you ; but never more be an officer of mine .
look , my gentle love is awakened !
i 'll make you an example .
what 's the matter ?
all 's well now , sweetheart ; come away to bed .
propn , for your hurts , i myself will be your surgeon .
take him away .
iago , look carefully about the town , and silence those whom this vile brawl has upset .
what , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
yes , beyond all cures .
by propn , propn forbid !
reputation , reputation , reputation !
o , i have lost my reputation !
i have lost the immortal part of myself , and what remains is beastly .
my reputation , propn , my reputation !
as i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound ; there is more sense in that than in reputation .
reputation is an idle and very false burden , often got without merit and lost without being deserved .
you have lost no reputation at all , unless you believe yourself to be such a loser .
what , man !
there are ways to regain the general again .
you are now only fallen in his mood , a punishment more in policy than in malice ; even as some one would beat his defenseless dog to scare an imperious lion .
talk to him again , and he ’ ll like you again .
i will rather seek to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer .
drunk ?
and talk like a parrot ?
and squabble ?
swagger ?
swear ?
and pick a fight with my own shadow ?
o you invisible spirit of wine , if you do n ’ t have a name to be known by , let ’ s call you devil !
who were you following with your sword ?
what had he done to you ?
i do n ’ t know .
is it possible ?
i remember a lot , but nothing clearly , a quarrel , but not why .
o propn , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains !
that we should , with joy , pleasure , partying , and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
why , you ’ re sober enough now .
how did you get this sober ?
come , you are too moral .
as the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , i could heartily wish this had not happen , but since it is what it is , fix it for your own good .
i ’ ll ask him for my job back ; he ’ ll tell me i am a drunkard !
if i had as many mouths as a seven - headed goddess , such an answer would shut them all .
now i ’ m a sensible man , soon a fool , and now a beast !
o strange !
every uncontrolled cup is evil , and the ingredient is a devil .
come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it is well used .
say no more against it .
and , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you .
i have well proven it , sir .
i got drunk !
you , or any man living , may be drunk at a time , man .
i 'll tell you what you shall do .
freely tell her the truth ; beg her help to put you in your place again .
she is so free , so kind , so proper , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a sin in her goodness not to do more than she is asked .
beg her to fix this broken joint between you and her husband , and , i ’ ll bet against any thing worth naming , this crack in your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
you advise me well .
no , only in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
you are right .
good - night , lieutenant ; i must get going to the guard .
good night , honest iago .
and who ’ s he , then , that says i play the villain ?
when this advice i give is free and honest , calculated to his thinking , and , indeed , the way to win the propn again ?
because it is very easy to involve the listening propn in any honest pursuit .
she 's been made as fruitful as the free elements .
and then for her to win the propn , if it meant renouncing his own baptism , all seals and symbols of forgiveness , his soul is so chained to her love that she may make , unmake , do whatever she wants , even as her wishes shall play the god with his weak ability to think .
how am i , then , a villain to advise propn to this parallel course , directly to his good ?
divinity of hell !
so i will turn her virtue into black tar , and out of her own goodness make the net that shall tangle them all up .
what ’ s up , propn !
i followed you here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts , but like the hunted by the hound .
how poor are they who have no patience !
what wound ever healed except bit by bit ?
you know we work by wit and not by witchcraft ; and wit depends on slow time .
does n ’ t it go well ?
by the mass , it is morning ; pleasure and work make the hours seem short .
go get some sleep ; go where you are staying .
get going , i say ; you shall know more later ; no , get going .
gentlemen , play here , i will reward your pains , something that 's brief and say , “ good morning , propn . ” hey , fellows , have your instruments been in propn , that they sound as horrible as like this ?
what , sir , how !
are these , i beg you , wind instruments ?
yes , by propn , they are , sir .
what “ half the story , ” sir ?
by propn , sir , by many a wind instrument that i know .
well , sir , we wo n ’ t .
we do n ’ t have any , sir .
then put your pipes away in your bag , because i 'm leaving .
did you hear , my honest friend ?
no , i do n ’ t hear your honest friend ; i hear you .
i beg you , keep up your jokes .
there 's a poor piece of gold for you .
if the gentlewoman that attends the general 's wife is awake , tell her there 's one propn begs a little favor of speaking with her .
will you do this ?
do , my good friend .
good to see you , propn .
you have not been to bed then ?
why , no ; the day dawned before we parted .
i have made bold , propn , to send for your wife .
my request to her is , that she will manage to get me access to virtuous propn .
i 'll send her to you right away , and i 'll devise a plan to get the propn out of the way , that your conversation and business may be more free .
i humbly thank you for it .
i never knew a propn more kind and honest .
the general and his wife are talking about it ; and she strongly speaks up for you .
the propn replies that the man you hurt is very famous in propn and has a great reputation , and that , in pure wisdom , he might not refuse you , but he protests he loves you and needs no other person begging than his own opinion to take the safest public occasion to bring you back again .
still , i beg you , if you think it ’ s okay , or that it may be done , get me a chance to speak briefly with propn alone .
i beg you , come in .
i will hide you where you shall have time to speak your heart freely .
thank you so much .
well , my good lord , i 'll do it .
this fortification , gentlemen , shall we see it ?
we 'll wait for your lordship .
be assured , good propn , i will do all i can in your behalf .
o , that 's an honest fellow .
do n ’ t doubt it , propn , that i will have my lord and you as friendly again as you were .
generous madam , whatever shall become of propn propn , he 'll never be anything but your true servant .
yes , but , lady , that policy may either last so long , or feed on such nice and light diet , or take itself so out of circumstance , that , with my absence and my place filled , my general will forget my love and service .
my lord shall never rest ; i 'll watch him calmly , and talk him out of patience ; his bed shall seem like a school , his meals a confessional ; i 'll intermingle everything he does with propn 's suit .
therefore be happy , propn ; because your lawyer would rather die than lose your case .
propn , here comes my lord .
propn , i 'll leave .
why , stay , and listen to me speak .
propn , not now .
i am very uncomfortable , propn for my own intentions .
well , have it your way .
ha !
i do n ’ t like that .
what did you say ?
was n ’ t that propn leaving my wife ?
propn , my lord !
no , sure , i can not believe that he would steal away so guiltily , seeing you coming .
i do believe it was he .
how now , my lord !
i have been talking with a petitioner here , a man that suffers greatly in your displeasure .
who is it you mean ?
why , your lieutenant , propn .
did n ’ t he just leave ?
yes , truly , so humbled that he has left part of his grief with me to suffer with him .
good love , call him back .
not now , sweet propn ; some other time .
but shall it be soon ?
the sooner , sweet , for you .
shall it be tonight at supper ?
no , not tonight .
tomorrow night at dinner then ?
i wo n ’ t be eating at home ; i have to meet the captains at the fortress .
in faith , he 's very sorry ; and yet his crime , in our common reason , except that , they say , the wars must make examples out of their best , is not almost a fault to incur a private punishment .
when shall he come ?
tell me , propn .
i wonder in my soul what you would ask me to do that i should deny , or stand so hesitant about .
what !
no , when i have a favor to ask where i mean to touch your love indeed , it shall be full of confidence and heavy , and fearful to be granted .
shall i deny you ?
no .
farewell , my lord .
emilia , come .
be as your thoughts teach you ; whatever you are , i am obedient .
excellent wretch !
destruction take my soul , but i do love you !
and when i do n ’ t love you , propn comes back .
did propn propn , when you courted my lady , know about your love ?
he did , from first to last .
why do you ask ?
only to satisfy my thought , no further harm .
what bout your thought , propn ?
i did n ’ t think he had been acquainted with her .
o , yes ; and went between us very often .
indeed !
indeed !
yes , indeed .
do you see anything in that ?
is n ’ t he honest ?
honest , my lord !
honest !
yes , honest .
my lord , for all i know .
what do you think ?
think , my lord !
think , my lord !
by propn , he echoes me , as if there were some monster in his thoughts too hideous to be shown .
what did n ’ t you like ?
if you do love me , tell me what you were thinking .
my lord , you know i love you .
i think you do ; and , because i know you are full of love and honesty and weigh your words carefully before saying them , these stops of yours frighten me even more , because such things in a false , disloyal rogue are tricks of custom , but in a man that 's just they 're hidden delays , working from the heart , that passion can not control .
for propn propn , i would swear i think that he is honest .
i think so too .
men should be what they seem ; or those that are not , i wish would n ’ t seem so !
certainly , men should be what they seem .
why , then , i think propn 's an honest man .
speak my thoughts ?
why , what if they are vile and false , where 's that palace that foul things sometimes intrude ?
who has a breast so pure that some unclean thoughts keep court records and legal holidays , and sit in session with lawful deliberations ?
you conspire against your friend , propn , if you only think him wronged and wo n ’ t let him be anything but a stranger to your thoughts .
i do beg you , although i am , perhaps , vicious in my guess , as i confess it is a bad habit of mine to look deeply into wrongs , and to find faults that are n ’ t by my jealousy , that your wisdom still would take no propn from one that so imperfectly imagines things , or create a problem for yourself out of his scattered and unsure observations .
it ’ s not good for your peace or your wellbeing , or for my manhood , honesty , or wisdom to let you know my thoughts .
what do you mean ?
by propn , i 'll know you ’ re thinking .
you can not , unless my heart were in your hand , and that wo n ’ t happen while it is in my custody .
ha !
that deceived man lives in bliss who , certain of his fate , does n ’ t love who wronged him ; but o , what damned stories he tells about who loves , but doubts , suspects , but strongly loves !
o misery !
why , why is this ?
do you think i 'd make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions ?
trade me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such puffed up and blown suspicions , matching your suggestion .
it wo n ’ t make me jealous , to say my wife is beautiful , cooks well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances well ; where virtue is , these are more virtuous .
and i wo n ’ t draw from my own weak merits the smallest fear or doubt of her turning against me , because she had eyes and chose me .
no , propn , i 'll see before i doubt ; when i doubt , i ’ ll need proof ; and on the proof , there is no more but this , to hell with love or jealousy at once !
i ’ m glad to hear it ; because now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with a more open spirit .
therefore , as i am supposed to , receive it from me .
i do n ’ t speak yet of proof .
look at your wife ; observe her well with propn ; wear your eye like this , not jealous or secure .
i know our country ’ s disposition well ; in propn they let propn see the pranks they would n ’ t dare show their husbands ; their best conscience is n ’ t to leave it unfinished , but to keep it unknown .
you say so ?
she deceived her father by marrying you ; and when she seemed to shake and fear your looks , she loved them most .
and so she did .
i am bound to you forever .
i see this has dashed your spirits a little .
not a jot , not a jot .
trust me , i fear it has .
i hope you will consider that what i have spoken comes from my love ; but i see you 're upset .
i beg you not to push my speech to grosser issues or to reach beyond propn suspicion .
i will not .
should you do so , my lord , my speech should fall into such vile things that my thoughts are not aimed at .
no , not too upset .
i can only think that propn 's honest .
long live she so !
and long live you to think so !
but pardon me .
i do n ’ t have the position to speak knowingly of her ; although i may fear , her will , rebelling against her better judgment , may decide to match you with her countrymen , and happily repent her ways .
leave me , propn .
my lord , i ’ m leaving .
why did i get married ?
this honest creature undoubtedly sees and knows more , much more , than he reveals .
in the meantime , please think i am too occupied with my fears , as there are strong reasons to fear i am , and consider her innocent , i beg your honor .
do n ’ t be afraid of what i think .
once more , i ’ m leaving .
this fellow 's exceedingly honesty , and knows all qualities , with an educated spirit , of human dealings .
if i prove her unfaithful , although that her leashes were my dear heartstrings , i 'd suddenly go away , and let her follow the wind to plunder fortune .
o curses on marriage , that we can call these delicate creatures ours , and not control their appetites !
i had rather be a toad , and live on the air of a dungeon , than keep a piece of the thing i love for others ' uses .
still , it is the plague of great men , they have fewer choices than common men ; it is an unshakeable destiny , like death .
i 'll not believe it .
how are you , my dear othello !
your dinner and the generous islanders you invited , wait for your presence .
i am to blame .
why do you speak so softly ?
are you unwell ?
i have a pain on my forehead here .
come , i 'll go in with you .
i am very sorry that you are not well .
i 'll have the embroidery taken out , and give it propn .
what he will do with it propn knows , i do n ’ t ; i only give it to him to please him .
do n ’ t scold ; i have something for you .
a thing for me !
it is a common thing … ha !
to have a foolish wife .
o , is that all ?
what will you give me now for that same handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
what handkerchief !
why , the one that the propn first gave to propn ; the one that you asked me so often to steal .
have you stolen it from her ?
look , here it is .
a good wench ; give it to me .
what will you do with it , that you have been so eager for me to steal it ?
why , what 's that to you ?
if it ’ s not for an important purpose , give it back to me again .
poor lady , she 'll run mad when she misses it .
mind your own business ; i have use for it .
go , leave me .
i will put this napkin in propn 's room , and let him find it .
not poppy , nor mandragora , nor all the drowsy drugs of the world , propn ever bring you that sweet sleep which you had yesterday .
why , how are you , general !
no more of that .
go away !
be gone !
what , my lord !
what sense did i have of her stolen hours of lust ?
i am sorry to hear this .
i would ’ ve been happy if the entire camp , propn and all , had tasted her sweet body , as long as i did n ’ t know about it .
o , now , forever propn to the peaceful mind !
farewell happiness !
farewell to the plumed forces and the big wars that make ambition a virtue !
o , farewell , propn the neighing horse and the shrill trumpet , the spirit - stirring drum , the ear - piercing fife , the royal banner , and all goodness , propn , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
and , o you mortal device , whose rude throats propn to be the immortal propn 's dread clamors , propn !
othello 's occupation 's gone !
is it possible , my lord ?
villain , be sure you prove my love a whore ; be sure of it .
give me the proof i can see ; or , by the worth of man 's eternal soul , you would ’ ve been better born a dog than answer my aroused anger !
has it come to this ?
make me see it ; or at the least prove it so that the accusation has no hinges or loops to hang a doubt on , or woe on your life !
o grace !
o propn defend me !
are you a man ?
have you got a soul or sense ?
propn be with you ; take my job .
o wretched fool , that lives to make your honesty a vice !
o monstrous world !
take note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe .
i thank you for this lesson ; and from this point forward , i 'll love no friend , since love breeds such contempt .
i should be wise , because honesty 's a fool , and loses what it works for .
by the world , i think my wife is honest , and think she is not ; i think that you are just , and think you are not .
i 'll have some proof .
her name , that was as fresh as propn 's face , is now as grimy and black as my own face .
if there are ropes or knives , poison or fire , or suffocating streams , i 'll not endure it .
i wish i were satisfied !
you would be satisfied ?
would ?
no , i will .
and may .
but how ?
how satisfied , my lord ?
death and damnation !
o !
it ’ s a lengthy problem , i think , to bring them to that event .
damn them then , if ever mortal eyes see them in any bed other than their own !
what then ?
how then ?
what shall i say ?
where 's satisfaction ?
it is impossible that you should see this if they were as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , as salty as wolves in a pride , and fools as disgusting as ignorance made drunk .
but still , i say , if suggestion and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth , will give you satisfaction , you may have it .
give me a living reason why she 's unfaithful .
i do n ’ t like the job ; but , since i am entered already so far into this cause , encouraged to it by foolish honesty and love , i will go on .
i slept with propn lately , and , being troubled with a raging tooth , i could not sleep .
no , this was only his dream .
and this may help to support other proofs that look questionable .
i 'll tear her all to pieces .
tell me but this , have n ’ t you sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife 's hand ?
i gave her such a one ; it was my first gift .
now i see it is true .
arise , black vengeance , from your hollow hell !
yield up , o love , your crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate !
propn , bosom , with your fury , because it is from lavender ’ s tongues !
yet calm down .
o , blood , propn , blood !
patience , i say ; your mind may perhaps change .
let him command , and it shall be penance for me to obey , whatever the bloody business is .
damn her , lewd cat !
o , damn her !
come , go aside with me ; i will leave so i can equip me with some swift means of death for the beautiful devil .
now you are my lieutenant .
i am your own forever .
do you know , servant , where propn propn lies ?
i dare not say he lies anywhere .
why , man ?
he 's a soldier ; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing him .
to tell you where he lives is to tell you where i lie .
can anything be made out of this ?
i do n ’ t know where he lives ; and for me to make up a lodging , and say he lies here or he lies there is to lie in my own throat .
can you ask about him and be satisfied by the reports ?
i will preach to the world for him ; that is , make questions and answer them .
seek him , bid him come here .
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
to do this is within the scope of man 's wit , and therefore , i will attempt to do it .
where should i have lost that handkerchief , propn ?
i do n ’ t know , madam .
believe me , i would rather have lost my purse full of money , and , except that my noble propn is true of mind and made of no such lowness as jealous creatures are , it would be enough to put him to ill thinking .
is n ’ t he jealous ?
who , he ?
i think the sun where he was born took all such humors out of him .
look , here he comes .
i will not leave him now until propn is called to him .
how is it with you , my lord ?
well , my good lady .
o , hardness to lie !
how are you , propn ?
well , my good lord .
give me your hand .
this hand is moist , my lady .
this hand of yours requires a vacation from liberty , fasting , and prayer , much punishment , holy exercise , because here 's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels .
it is a good hand , an open one .
you may , indeed , say so , because it was that hand that gave away my heart .
a liberal hand .
the hearts of old gave hands , but our new code of behavior is hands , not hearts .
i can not speak about this .
come now , your promise .
what promise , dear ?
i have sent to bid propn to come and speak with you .
i have salty and sorry tears that bother me ; lend me your handkerchief .
here , my lord .
the one i gave you .
i do n ’ t have it with me .
no ?
no , faith , my lord .
that is a mistake .
an propn gave that handkerchief to my mother ; she cast charms and could almost read the thoughts of people .
she told her , that , while she kept it , it would make her sweet and soften my father entirely to her love ; but if she lost it or made a gift of it , my father 's eye should see her as hateful , and his spirits should hunt after new loves .
my mother , dying , gave it to me , and asked me , when my fate would have me marry , to give it to my wife .
is it possible ?
indeed !
is it true ?
very true ; therefore look well for it .
then i wish to propn that i had never seen it !
ha !
why ?
why do you speak so haltingly and angrily ?
is it lost ?
is it gone ?
speak , is it missing ?
propn bless us !
what do you say ?
it is not lost ; but what if it were ?
how ?
i say , it is not lost .
go get it , let me see it .
why , so i can , sir , but i wo n ’ t now .
this is a trick to distract me from my request .
i beg you , let propn be welcomed again .
come , come ; you 'll never meet a more capable man .
the handkerchief !
a man that all his life has founded his good fortunes on your love , shared dangers with you , the handkerchief !
in truth , you are to blame .
go away !
this man is n ’ t jealous ?
i never saw this before .
surely there 's some magic in this handkerchief ; i am very unhappy at the loss of it .
go and beg her .
hello , good propn !
what 's the news with you ?
i would not be delayed .
alas , thrice - gentle propn !
my pleading is out of tune right now ; my lord is not my lord ; and i would n ’ t know him if he were he in favor as changed in disposition .
so every holy spirit help me , as i have spoken all my best for you , and stood shocked at his displeasure over my free speech !
you must be patient a while .
what i can do , i will ; and i will do as much more than i dare do for myself .
let that satisfy you .
is my lord angry ?
he went just left , and certainly in a strange state of upset .
can he be angry ?
something of the moment , then .
i beg you , do so .
surely it ’ s some matter of state , either from propn or some minor problem shown to him here in propn , that has muddied his clear spirit , and in such cases propn 's natures fight with inferior things , although their object is great ones .
it ’ s even so true that we let our finger ache and it infects our other healthful members , even to the point of pain .
scold me a lot , propn , i was , unhandsome warrior as i am , charging his unkindness with a crime of my soul ; but now i find i had falsely testified , and he 's falsely accused .
pray propn it is state matters , as you think , and no plot or no jealous reason concerning you .
propn the day , i never gave him reason !
but jealous souls will not be answered that way ; they are not ever jealous for a reason , but jealous because they are jealous .
it is a monster fathered by itself , born of itself .
propn keep that monster from propn 's mind !
propn , amen .
i ’ ll go find him .
propn , walk around here .
if i do find him fit , i 'll ask for your favor , and try to get it done the best way i can .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
save you , friend propn !
what are doing away from home ?
how are you , my very beautiful propn ?
actually , sweet love , i was just coming to your house .
seven days and nights ?
one hundred sixty - eight hours ?
and lovers ' absent hours being more tedious than the clock one hundred sixty times ?
o weary calculations !
o propn , where did you get this ?
this is some gift from a newer girlfriend .
well , well .
come one , woman !
throw your vile guesses into the devil 's teeth , from where you got them .
you are jealous now that this is from some mistress , some gift .
why , whose is it ?
i do n ’ t know either .
i found it in my bedroom .
i really like the work .
leave you !
why ?
i ’ m waiting here for the general , and i do n ’ t think it would help , and it ’ s not my wish , to have him see me talking with a woman .
why , i beg you ?
not that i do n ’ t love you .
but it ’ s that you do n ’ t love me .
i beg you , walk with me on the way a little ; and say if i shall see you later tonight .
that ’ s very good ; i must be patient .
will you think so ?
think so , propn ?
what , to kiss in private ?
an unauthorized kiss .
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
naked in bed , propn , and not mean harm !
why , then , it is hers , my lord , and being hers , she may , i think , give it to any man .
yes , what of that ?
that 's not so good now .
what , if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ?
he has , my lord ; but be well assured , no more than he 'll deny .
what has he said ?
faith , that he did , i do n ’ t know what he did .
what ?
what ?
with her , on her , whatever you want to think .
that 's sickening .
nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some reason .
it is not words that shake me like this .
rubbish !
noses , ears , and lips .
is it possible ?
o devil !
work on , my medicine , work !
believing fools are caught like this ; and many worthy and chaste dames just like this , all innocent , meet punishment .
what , ho !
my lord !
my lord , i say !
othello !
how are you , propn !
what 's the matter ?
rub him around the temples .
step aside and hide yourself a little while , he will recover right away .
when he is gone , i would like to speak with you urgently .
how is it , general ?
have n ’ t hurt your head ?
do you make fun of me ?
i make fun of you !
no , by propn .
i wish you would bear your luck like a man !
an adulterer 's a monster and a beast .
there 's many a beast , then , in a crowded city , and many a civil monster .
did he confess it ?
good sir , be a man ; do you think every bearded fellow that wears a harness may be driven by you ?
there 's millions now alive that nightly lie in those adulterous beds which they dare to swear is the first time .
your case is better .
o , it is the spite of hell , the fiend 's high mockery , to kiss a whore on a safe couch , and to suppose her to be chaste !
no , let me know ; and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be .
o , you are wise ; that is certain .
stand you aside a while ; restrict yourself only in patient way .
while you were being overwhelmed here by your grief , a passion very unsuitable to such a man , propn came here .
i sent him away , and gave him a good excuse for your fit ; i told him to come back soon and speak here with me ; which he promised to do .
only hide yourself , and mark the sneers , the taunts , and outstanding scorns , that dwell in every region of his face , because i will make him tell the story as if it were new , about where , how , how often , how long ago , and when he has had , and is again to have , sex with your wife .
by propn , have patience ; or i shall say you are totally in a temper , and not a man .
do you hear me , propn ?
there ’ s nothing wrong with that , but still be patient in all .
will you leave and hide ?
now i will question propn about propn , a housewife that , by selling her desires , propn herself bread and clothes .
it is a creature that dotes on propn , as it is the whore 's disease to trick many and be tricked by one .
he , when he hears of her , can not refrain from excessive laughter .
here he comes .
as he smiles , propn shall go crazy ; and his ignorant jealousy must interpret propn propn 's smiles , gestures , and happy behavior all wrong .
how are you now , lieutenant ?
the worse that you give me the additional information whose lack of information even kills me .
persist with propn well , and you are sure of it .
now , if this promise was in propn 's power , how quickly you would you succeed !
alas , poor wretch !
look , how he laughs already !
i never knew a woman could love man so .
alas , poor rogue !
i think , in faith , she loves me .
now he denies it faintly and laughs it out .
do you hear me , propn ?
now he urges him to tell it again .
do it , it ’ s well said , well said .
ha , ha , ha !
do you win , roman ?
do you win ?
me marry her !
what ?
a customer !
i beg you , have some charity for my wit ; do n ’ t think it is so unwholesome .
ha , ha , ha !
so , so , so , so .
they laugh that win .
faith , the rumor goes that you shall marry her .
i beg you , tell the truth .
i am a very villain if i do n ’ t .
have you played me ?
well .
this is the monkey 's own rumor .
she is persuaded i will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out because of my promise .
iago beckons me ; now he begins the story .
she was here even now ; she haunts me in every place .
so hangs , and lolls , and weeps on me ; so hales and pulls me .
ha , ha , ha !
now he tells how she brought him to my bedroom .
o , i see that nose of yours , but not that dog i shall throw it to .
well , i must leave her company .
before me !
look , here she comes .
it ’ s another such polecat !
by propn , a perfumed one .
what do you mean by this haunting of me ?
let the devil and his dam haunt you !
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you just gave me ?
i was a fine fool to take it .
i must take out the embroidery ?
a likely piece of work that you should find it in your bedroom and not know who left it there !
this is some cat 's gift , and i must take out the work ?
there , give it to your whore .
wherever you had it , i wo n ’ t take out any embroidery .
come now , my sweet propn !
come now !
come now !
by propn , that ’ s my handkerchief !
if you 'll come to supper tonight , you may ; if you will not , come when you are next ready to .
after her , after her .
faith , i must , or else she 'll raise a ruckus in the street .
will you have dinner there ?
faith , i intend to .
well , i maybe i ’ ll see you ; because i would very gladly speak with you .
i beg you , come ; will you ?
ok , say no more .
how shall i murder him , propn ?
did you see how he laughed at his sin ?
o iago !
and did you see the handkerchief ?
was that mine ?
yours , i swear .
and to see how he prizes the foolish woman , your wife !
she gave it him , and he has given it his whore .
i would take nine years to kill him .
a fine woman !
a beautiful woman !
a sweet woman !
no , you must forget that .
yes , let her rot , and die , and be damned tonight ; because she shall not live .
no , my heart is turned to stone ; i hit it , and it hurts my hand .
o , the world has not a sweeter creature .
she might lie by an emperor 's side and order him to work .
no , that 's not your way .
hang her !
i only say what she is .
o , she will sing the savageness out of a bear !
of so high and full intelligence and imagination !
she 's the worse for all this .
o , a thousand , a thousand times .
and then , of so gentle a disposition !
yes , too gentle .
no , that 's certain .
but yet the pity of it , propn !
o propn , the pity of it , propn !
if you ’ re so fond of her sin , give her permission to offend ; because , if it does n ’ t affect you , it affects nobody .
i will chop her into pieces .
unfaithful to me !
o , it is evil in her .
with my officer !
that 's even more evil .
get me some poison , iago ; this night .
i 'll not argue with her , should her body and beauty change my mind again .
and for propn , let me be his undertaker .
you shall hear more by midnight .
excellent good .
a trumpet within .
what trumpet is that one ?
something from propn , surely .
it is propn come from the duke .
and , see , your wife is with him .
propn save you , worthy general !
with all my heart , sir .
the duke and senators of propn greet you .
i kiss the instrument of their desires .
and what 's the news , good cousin propn ?
i am very glad to see you , propn ; welcome to propn .
i thank you .
how does propn propn ?
he lives , sir .
propn , there 's an angry break up that ’ s fallen between him and my lord , but you shall make all well .
are you sure of that ?
my lord ?
is there division between my lord and propn ?
a very unhappy one .
i would do a lot to reconcile them , for the love i bear to propn .
fire and brimstone !
my lord ?
are you wise ?
what , is he angry ?
may be the letter upset him ; because , i think , they command him to come home , making propn governor in his place .
trust me , i am glad about it .
indeed !
my lord ?
i am glad to see you angry .
i have not deserved this .
my lord , this would not be believed in propn , although i could swear i saw it .
o devil , devil !
if the earth could be flooded with woman 's tears , each drop she lets fall would prove to be a crocodile .
out of my sight !
i will not stay to offend you .
propn !
my lord ?
what do you want with her , sir ?
who , i , my lord ?
proceed with your tears .
i am commanded home .
go away ; i 'll send for you soon .
propn , i obey the mandate , and will return to propn .
away , get going !
propn shall take my place .
and , sir , tonight , i beg you that we may dine together .
you are welcome , sir , to propn .
goats and monkeys !
is this the noble propn whom our full senate propn had it all ?
is this the nature that passion could not shake ?
whose solid virtue could be neither grazed nor pierced by the shot of accident or dart of fate ?
he is very changed .
is he sane ?
he ’ s not sick in the brain ?
he 's what he is .
what , strike his wife !
faith , that was not good ; still i wish i knew if that stroke would prove to be the worst !
is it his habit ?
or did the letters work on his blood , and newly create this fault ?
alas , alas !
it is not honesty in me to discuss what i have seen and known .
i am sorry that i was wrong about him .
you have seen nothing , then ?
not ever heard , or ever suspected .
yes , you have seen propn and her together .
but then i saw no harm , and then i heard each syllable that was exchanged between them .
what , did they never whisper ?
never , my lord .
nor send you out of the way ?
never .
to fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , or anything ?
never , my lord .
that 's strange .
i dare , my lord , to bet that she is honest , burn me at the stake .
if any wretch has put this in your head , let propn repay them with the serpent 's curse !
because if she is not honest , chaste , and true , there 's no man happy ; the purest of their wives is wicked as the leis about them .
she says enough ; yet she 's a simple rabbit that can not say as much .
my lord , what is your will ?
please , dear , come here .
what is your pleasure ?
let me see your eyes ; look into my face .
what horrible desire is this ?
on my knees , what does your speech mean ?
i understand a fury in your words , but not the words .
why , what are you ?
your wife , my lord ; your true and loyal wife .
come , swear it , damn yourself ; propn , being like one of propn , the devils themselves should fear to seize you .
therefore be double - damned , propn you are honest .
propn does truly know it .
propn truly knows that you are as false as hell .
to whom , my lord ?
with whom ?
how am i false ?
o propn !
away !
away !
away !
alas the heavy day !
why do you cry ?
am i the motive for these tears , my lord ?
if you maybe suspect my father is an instrument of this calling you back , do n ’ t lay your blame on me .
if you have lost him , why , i have lost him too .
or keep it as a jug to hold dirty toads to knot and give birth in !
turn your face there , patience , you young and rose - lipped archangel , yes , there , look as grim as hell !
i hope my noble lord believes i am faithful .
o , yes ; as summer flies are in the swamps , that move quickly even with blowing .
o you weed , who are so lovely beautiful , and smell so sweet , that the sense aches at you , i wish you had never been born !
alas , what ignorant sin have i committed ?
was this beautiful paper , this very excellent book , made to write “ whore ” on ?
what sin committed !
committed !
o you public commoner !
i should make very fires of my cheeks burn modesty into ashes , if i only spoke your deeds .
what committed !
propn thumbs its nose at it , and the moon winks ; the obscene wind that kisses all it meets is quiet within the hollow tunnels of earth , and will not hear it .
what committed !
impudent prostitute !
by propn , you do me wrong .
are n ’ t you a prostitute ?
no , as i am a propn .
if to preserve this body for my lord from any other evil unlawful touch is not to be a prostitute , i am none .
what , not a whore ?
no , as i shall be saved .
is it possible ?
o , propn forgive us !
you , mistress , that have the office next to propn propn , and keep the gate of hell !
you , you , yes , you !
alas , what does this gentleman mean ?
how are you , madam ?
how are you , my good lady ?
faith , half asleep .
good madam , what 's the matter with my lord ?
with who ?
why , with my lord , madam .
who is your lord ?
he that is yours , sweet lady .
i have none .
do n ’ t talk to me , propn ; i can not weep , and i do n ’ t have any answers , except what should go by water .
i beg you , tonight propn my wedding sheets on my bed , remember ?
and i ’ ll call your husband here .
here 's a change indeed !
it ’ s right i should be used this way , very right .
how have i behaved , that he might put the smallest opinion on my least misconduct ?
what is your pleasure , madam ?
how is it with you ?
i can not tell .
what 's the matter , lady ?
alas , propn , my lord has accused her of being a prostitute , propn such angry and horrible words at her , as true hearts can not bear .
am i that name , propn ?
what name , beautiful lady ?
such as she says my lord said i was .
why did he do it ?
i do n ’ t know ; i am sure i am no one like that .
do n ’ t weep , do n ’ t weep .
alas the day !
she has abandoned so many noble matches , her father , and her country , and her friends , to be called whore ?
would n ’ t it make one weep ?
it is my wretched luck .
how did this trick come on him ?
no , only propn knows .
i will be hanged , if some eternal villain , some busy and insinuating rogue , some scheming , lying slave , to get some job , has n ’ t made up this slander , or else , i 'll be hanged .
damn , there is no such man ; it is impossible .
if there is a man like that , propn pardon him !
a noose pardon him !
and hell chew on his bones !
why should he call her whore ?
who keeps her company ?
what place ?
what time ?
what form ?
what likelihood ?
the propn 's abused by some very villainous rogue , some base notorious rogue , some scurvy fellow .
o propn , that you would expose such companions , and put a whip in every honest hand to whip the rascals naked throughout the world , even from the east to the west !
speak behind the door .
o , damn on them !
he was some such squire that turned your wit inside out , and made you to suspect me of sleeping with the propn .
you are a fool ; be quiet .
alas , propn , what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friend , go to him ; because , by this light of propn , i do n ’ t know how i lost him .
unkindness may do much , and his unkindness may kill my life , but never taint my love .
if it were any other … it ’ s only that , i guarantee it .
listen how these instruments summon us to supper !
what now , propn !
i do n ’ t believe that you deal justly with me .
on the contrary .
every day you get me out of the way with some plan , iago ; and rather , as it seems to me now , keep from me all convenience than supplies me with the least advantage of hope .
will you listen to me , propn ?
i ’ ve heard too much already , because your words and actions do n ’ t agree with each other .
you accuse me most unjustly .
with nothing but truth .
i have wasted myself out of my money .
the jewels you have had from me to deliver to propn would half have corrupted a nun .
well ; ok ; very well .
very well !
ok !
i can not “ ok , ” man and it is not very well .
no , i say it is very contemptible , and begin to find myself fooled by it .
very well .
i tell you it is not very well .
you have said so .
yes , and said nothing except that which i have every intention of doing .
why , now i see there 's spirit in you ; and even from this instant , you build a better opinion of yourself than ever before .
give me your hand , propn .
you have taken a very just exception against me ; but still , i protest , i have dealt very directly concerning your affair .
it does n ’ t seem so .
i grant indeed it has n ’ t seemed so , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment .
well , what is it ?
is it within reason and can be done ?
propn , there is special commission come from propn to put propn in propn 's place .
is that true ?
why , then propn and propn return again to propn .
o , no ; he goes into propn , and takes the beautiful propn away with him , unless his living here can be delayed by some accident which no one can be so determined about removing of propn .
how do you mean removing of him ?
why , by making him incapable of propn 's place ; knocking his brains out .
and you would have me do that ?
yes , if you dare to do yourself a profit and a right .
he eats tonight with a harlot , and i will go there to him .
he does n ’ t know yet about his honorable fortune .
come , stand not amazed at it , but go along with me ; i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to kill him .
it is now high dinner time , and the night is being wasted .
let ’ s go .
i will hear further reason for this .
and you shall be satisfied .
i do beg you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
o , pardon me ; it will do me good to walk .
propn , good night ; i humbly thank your ladyship .
your honor is very welcome .
will you walk , sir ?
my lord ?
i will , my lord .
how goes it now ?
he looks gentler than he did .
dismiss me ?
it was his bidding ; therefore , good propn , give me my nightgown , and goodbye .
we must not now displease him .
i wish you had never seen him !
so do i .
my love forgives him so , that even his stubbornness , his checks , his frowns , i beg you , unpin my hair , have grace and favor in them .
i have put on those sheets you asked me to .
makes no difference .
good faith , how foolish are our minds !
if i die before you , i beg you , shroud me in one of those same sheets .
come , come , how you talk .
my mother had a maid called propn ; she was in love ; and the man she loved went crazy and left her .
she had a song of `` willow , `` it was an old thing but it expressed her fortune , and she died singing it .
i beg you , leave .
shall i go get your nightgown ?
no , unpin my hair .
this propn is a proper man .
a very handsome man .
he speaks well .
i know a lady in propn would have walked barefoot to propn for a touch of his lower lip .
the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree , sing all a green willow ; her hand on her breast , her head on her knee , sing willow , willow , willow .
it 's the wind .
i called my love false love ; but what said he then ?
my eyes itch ; does that predict tears ?
it is neither here nor there .
i have heard it said so .
o , these men , these men !
do you in conscience think , tell me , propn , that there are women who abuse their husbands in such a disgusting way ?
there are some such , no doubt .
would you do such a deed for all the world ?
why , would n ’ t you ?
no , by this heavenly light !
nor i neither by this heavenly light ; i might do it as well in the dark .
would you do such a deed for all the world ?
the world 's a huge thing ; it is a great price to pay for a small sin .
in truth , i think you would n ’ t .
in truth , i think i should ; and undo it when i had done .
by propn , i would n ’ t do such a thing for a gold ring , or for measures of soft cotton , or for gowns , petticoats , or caps , or any little show ; but , for the whole world -why , who would n ’ t unfaithful to her husband to make him a king ?
i would risk purgatory for it .
curse me , if i would do such a wrong thing for the whole world .
why , the wrong is but a wrong in the world ; and having the world for your work , it is a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
i do n ’ t think there is any such woman .
yes , a dozen ; and as many to profit as would store the world they played for .
what is it that they do when they exchange us for others ?
is it sport ?
i think it does .
is it frailty makes mistakes like this ?
it ’ s so too .
and have n ’ t we got affections , desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
good - night , good - night .
propn me send such usage , not to pick bad from bad , but to change my ways by bad !
quickly , quickly ; fear nothing ; i 'll be at your elbow .
it makes us or it ruins us ; think on that , and make your resolution very firm .
be near at hand ; i mess it up .
go forth , my sword ; he dies .
i have rubbed this young pimple almost to the purpose , and he grows angry .
now , whether or not he kills propn , or propn him , or each do kill the other , i gain in every way .
live , propn , he calls me to give back all of gold and jewels that i robbed from him , as gifts to propn ; it ca n ’ t happen .
if propn lives , he has a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly ; and besides , the propn may disclose me to him ; i stand there in great danger ; no , he must die .
i know his walk ; it is he .
villain , you die !
o , i am slain !
i am maimed forever .
help , ho !
murder !
murder !
o , villain that i am !
it is even so .
o , help , ho !
light !
a surgeon !
it is he .
o brave propn , honest and just , that have such noble sense of your friend 's wrong !
prostitute , i ’ m coming !
those charms , your eyes , are erased from my heart ; your bed , lust - stained , shall be spotted with lust 's blood .
what , ho !
no guard ?
no safety ?
murder !
murder !
it is some misfortune ; the cry is very sorrowful .
o , help !
listen !
o wretched villain !
nobody comes ?
then i shall bleed to death .
listen !
here 's someone comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
who 's there ?
did n ’ t you hear a cry ?
here , here !
for propn 's sake , help me !
what 's the matter ?
this is propn 's ensign , as i take it .
the same indeed ; a very valiant fellow .
who are you here that cry so grievously ?
iago ?
o , i am attacked , undone by villains !
give me some help .
o me , lieutenant !
what villains have done this ?
i think that one of them is still around here , and can not make a getaway .
o treacherous villains !
who are you there ?
come in and give some help .
o , help me here !
that 's one of them .
o murderous slave !
o villain !
o damned propn !
o inhuman dog !
kill men in the dark !
where are these bloody thieves ?
how silent is this town !
ho !
murder !
murder !
what are you ?
are you of good or evil ?
as you shall prove us to be , praise us .
propn propn ?
he , sir .
i be your mercy .
here 's propn , hurt by villains .
propn !
how is it , brother ?
my leg is cut in two .
by propn , propn forbid !
what is the matter , ho ?
who is it that cried ?
who is it that cried !
o my dear propn , my sweet propn !
o propn , propn , propn !
o notable prostitute !
propn , do you any idea who they are that have mangled you like this ?
no .
lend me a garter .
so .
o , for a chair , to carry him easily from here !
alas , he faints !
o propn , propn , propn !
gentlemen all , i suspect this trash to be a party to this injury .
patience awhile , good propn .
come , come ; lend me a light .
do we know this face or not ?
alas , my friend and my dear countryman propn ?
no .
yes , surely ; o heaven !
propn .
what , of propn ?
even he , sir .
did you know him ?
know him !
yes .
propn propn ?
i beg your gentle pardon ; these bloody accidents must excuse my manners , that so neglected you .
o , a chair , a chair !
propn !
he , he , it is he .
some good men carry him carefully from here ; i 'll fetch the general 's surgeon .
for you , mistress , save you your labor .
none in the world ; i do n ’ t know the man .
what , do you look pale ?
o , carry him out of the air .
stay you , good gentlemen .
do you look pale , mistress ?
do you see the ghastliness of her eye ?
no , if you stare , we shall hear more soon .
watch her well ; i beg you , look after her .
do you see , gentlemen ?
no , guiltiness will speak even if tongues are out of use .
alas , what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter , husband ?
alas , good gentleman !
alas , good propn !
this is the fruit of whoring .
i beg you , propn , propn find out about propn , where he had dinner tonight .
what , you shake at that ?
he dined at my house ; but i do n ’ t shake because of that .
o , did he ?
i charge you , go with me .
damn , damn you , prostitute !
i am no prostitute , but have life as honest as you that abuse me like this .
as i !
damn !
damn you !
kind gentlemen , let 's go see poor propn bandaged .
come , mistress , you must tell us another tale .
emilia , run to the fortress , and tell my lord and lady what has happened .
will you go ahead ?
aside .
this is the night that either makes me or breaks me .
it is the cause .
still i wo n ’ t shed her blood ; or scar that skin of hers whiter than snow , and as smooth as the marble that makes monuments .
yet she must die , or else she 'll betray more men .
put out the light , and then put out the light .
o , balmy breath , that almost persuades propn to break her sword !
one more , one more ; be like this when you are dead , and i will kill you , and love you after .
one more , and this is the last ; so sweet was never so fatal .
she awakes .
who 's there ?
othello ?
yes , propn .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
have you prayed tonight , propn ?
yes , my lord .
if you can think of any crime not yet confessed to heaven and grace , do it right away .
alas , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
i would not kill your soul .
you talk about killing ?
yes , i do .
then propn have mercy on me !
amen , with all my heart !
if you say so , i hope you will not kill me .
hum !
and yet i fear you ; because you are deadly when your eyes roll so .
why i should fear , i do n ’ t know , since i do n ’ t know guiltiness , but yet i feel i fear .
think on your sins .
they are loves i bear to you .
yes , and for that you die .
that death is unnatural that kills for loving .
alas , why do you chew your nether lip so ?
peace , and be quiet !
i will do so .
what 's the matter ?
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave you , you gave to propn .
no , by my life and soul !
send for the man and ask him .
sweet soul , take care , take care of perjury ; you are on your death - bed .
yes , but not to die yet .
you are to die .
then , propn have mercy on me !
i say , amen .
and you have mercy too !
i never offended you in my life ; never loved propn except with such general lawfulness of propn as i might love .
i never gave him gifts .
by propn , i saw my handkerchief in his hand .
o lying woman !
he found it then ; i never gave it to him .
he has confessed .
what , my lord ?
that he has used you .
how ?
unlawfully ?
yes .
he will not say so .
no , his mouth is stopped ; propn propn has taken orders for it .
o , my fear interprets !
what , is he dead ?
had all his hairs been lives , my great revenge had stomach for them all .
alas , he is betrayed , and i have no hope !
out , prostitute !
you weep for him to my face ?
o , banish me , my lord , but do n ’ t kill me !
down , prostitute !
kill me tomorrow ; let me live tonight !
no , if you strive … but half an hour !
being done , there is no pause .
but while i say one prayer !
it is too late .
my lord , my lord !
what , ho !
my lord , my lord !
what noise is this ?
not dead ?
not yet quite dead ?
i who is cruel am yet merciful ; i would not have you linger in your pain .
so , so .
what , ho !
my lord , my lord !
who 's there ?
o , my good lord , i would speak with you !
by and by .
she 's dead .
ha !
no more moving ?
as still as the grave .
shall she come in ?
were it good ?
i think she moves again .
no .
what 's best to do ?
if she comes in , she 'll surely speak to my wife .
my wife !
my wife !
what wife ?
i have no wife .
o , unbelievable !
o heavy hour !
i think there should now be a huge eclipse of sun and moon , and that the frightened globe should yawn at changes .
i beg you to let me speak with you , o , my good lord !
i had forgotten about you .
o , come in , propn .
softly , by and by .
let me draw the curtains .
where are you ?
what 's the matter with you now ?
o , my good lord , there 's foul murders done over there !
what , now ?
just now , my lord .
it is the very mistake of the moon ; she comes more nearer earth than she usually does and makes men mad .
propn , my lord , has killed a young propn called propn .
propn killed ?
and propn killed ?
no , propn is not killed .
propn not killed !
then murder 's out of tune , and sweet revenge grows harsh .
o , falsely , falsely murdered !
alas , what cry is that ?
that !
what ?
out , and alas !
that was my lady 's voice .
help !
help , ho !
help !
o lady , speak again !
propn propn !
o sweet mistress , speak !
i die an innocent death .
o , who has done this deed ?
nobody ; i myself .
o , farewell !
why should she be murdered ?
alas , who knows ?
you heard her say it herself it was n ’ t i .
o , she is more the angel , and you the blacker devil !
she turned to folly , and she was a whore .
you lie about her , and you are a devil .
she was false as water .
you are impatient as fire , to say that she was false .
o , she was heavenly true !
propn screwed her ; ask your husband otherwise .
o , i was damned beneath all the depths of hell , and i proceeded on just grounds to this extremity .
your husband knew it all .
my husband !
your husband .
that she was unfaithful in marriage ?
yes , with propn .
no , had she been true , if propn would make me such another world of one entire and perfect crystal , i would n ’ t have sold her for it .
my husband !
my husband !
why do you repeat it , woman ?
i said your husband .
o mistress , villainy has made fun with love !
my husband said that she was unfaithful !
he , woman ; i say your husband .
do you understand the word ?
my friend , your husband , honest , honest iago .
if he said so , may his evil soul propn half a grain a day !
he lies to the heart .
she was too fond of her very filthy bargain .
ha !
peace , you ’ d better stop .
you have not half that power to do me harm as i have to be hurt .
o fool !
o idiot !
as stupid as dirt !
you have done a deed , i do n ’ t care about your sword ; i 'll make you famous , although i lose twenty lives .
help !
help , ho !
help !
the propn has killed my mistress !
murder , murder !
what is the matter ?
what ’ s wrong , general !
o , are you here , propn ?
you have done well , that men must lay their murders on your neck .
what is the matter ?
speak , because my heart is full .
i told him what i thought ; and told no more than what he himself discovered was right and true .
but did you ever tell him she was unfaithful ?
i did .
you told a lie ; an stinking , damned lie ; on my soul , a lie ; a wicked lie .
she unfaithful with propn !
did you say with propn ?
with propn , mistress .
watch it , control your tongue .
i will not control my tongue ; i have to speak .
my mistress lies here murdered in her bed .
o heavens forbid !
and your stories have egged the murder on .
it is a strange truth .
o monstrous act !
villainy , villainy , villainy !
i think about it , i think , i smell it ; o villainy !
what , are you crazy ?
i order you , go home .
maybe , propn , i will never go home .
o !
o !
o !
no , lay down and roar ; because you have killed the sweetest innocent that ever lifted open eyes .
o , she was evil !
i scarcely knew you , uncle ; there lies your niece , whose breath , indeed , these hands have just stopped .
i know this act looks horrible and grim .
propn propn !
it was a handkerchief , an antique token my father gave my mother .
o heaven !
o heavenly powers !
come , hold your peace .
it will be out , it will be out .
me quiet !
be wise , and go home .
i will not .
damn !
your sword on a woman ?
o you stupid propn !
that handkerchief you speak of i found by luck and gave it to my husband ; because , he begged me to steal it often with a solemn earnestness , more than , indeed , belonged to such a trifle .
villainous whore !
she give it propn !
no , alas , i found it , and i gave it to my husband .
propn , you lie !
by propn , i do n ’ t , i do n ’ t , gentlemen .
o murderous simpleton !
what should such a fool do with so good a wife ?
are there no stones in propn to serve as thunder ?
precious villain !
the woman falls ; surely , he has killed his wife .
yes , yes .
o , lay me by my mistress ' side .
he 's gone , but his wife 's killed .
he is a notorious villain .
i 'll go after that same villain , because he is a damned slave .
i am not valiant either , but every puny man with a whip gets my sword .
but why should honor outlive honesty ?
let it all go .
what did your song predict , lady ?
listen , can you hear me ?
i will play the swan , and die in music .
sings .
propn , she was chaste ; she loved you , cruel propn ; so my soul goes to propn , because i tell the truth ; so speaking as i think , i die , i die .
propn , i must come out .
you have no weapon , and must be forced to suffer .
look in on me then , and speak with me , or , naked as i am , i will attack you .
what ’ s the matter ?
propn , i have a weapon ; a better one never sustained itself on a soldier 's thigh .
i have seen the day that i have made my way through more impediments with this little arm and this good sword than you could stop twenty times .
but , o vain boast !
who can control his fate ?
it is not so now .
do n ’ t be afraid although you see me armed , here is my journey 's end , here is my bottom and very sea - mark of my last ship .
do you go back dismayed ?
it is a lost fear ; man can only rush against propn 's breast , and he retires .
where should propn go ?
now , how do you look now ?
o ill - starred wench !
pale as your smock !
when we shall meet at elegance , this look of yours will hurl my soul from propn , and propn will scratch at it .
o cursed , cursed slave !
whip me , you devils , from the possession of this heavenly sight !
blow me about in winds !
roast me in fires of sulphur !
wash me in steep - down gulfs of liquid fire !
o propn !
dead , propn !
dead !
where is this impatient and very unfortunate man ?
where is that snake ?
bring the villain out .
i look down towards his feet ; but that 's a fable .
if you are a devil , i can not kill you .
grab his sword from him .
i bleed , sir , but i am not killed .
i am not sorry either .
i 'd have you live ; because , in my thinking , it is happiness to die .
o you othello , that was once so good , fallen in the plan of a damned slave , what shall be said to you ?
why , anything ; an honorable murderer , if you will ; because nothing i did was in hate , but done all in honor .
this wretch has part confessed his villainy .
did you and he agree to propn 's death ?
yes .
dear general , i never gave you any reason .
i do believe it , and i ask your pardon .
will you , i beg you , demand that demi - devil to tell why he has trapped my soul and body like this ?
from this time forward , i ’ ll never speak word .
what , not even to pray ?
torture will open your lips .
well , you do what ’ s best .
propn , you shall understand what has happened , which , as i think , you do n ’ t know .
here is a letter found in the pocket of the murdered propn , and here another .
one of them shows that the death of propn was to be undertaken by propn .
o villain !
very heathenish and very gross !
now here 's another unhappy document , found in his pocket too ; and this , it seems , that propn meant to have sent this damned villain ; but that , very likely , propn in the meantime came in and satisfied him .
o the pernicious wretch !
propn , how did you come by that handkerchief that was my wife 's ?
i found it in my bedroom ; and he himself confessed just now that he dropped it there for a special purpose which would be bent to his desires .
o fool !
fool !
fool !
for this slave , if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him a lot and stop him a long time , it shall be his .
you shall remain a prisoner , until the nature of your crime is known to the venetian state .
come , bring him away .
pardon me , a word or two before you go .
i have done the state some service , and they know it .
no more of that .
i beg you , in your letters , when you shall tell about these unlucky deeds , speak of me as i am ; nothing farfetched , and do n ’ t write anything in malice .
then you must speak of one that loved not wisely , but too well ; of one not easily jealous , but , being aggravated , confused in the extreme ; of one whose hand , like the low propn , threw a pearl away that was richer than all his tribe ; of one whose sad eyes , propn unused to a crying spell , propn tears as fast as the arabian trees drop their medicinal gum .
write this down ; and say besides , that in propn once , where a malignant and a turbaned propn beat a venetian and double - crossed the state , i took the circumcised dog by the throat and killed him like this .
o bloody period !
all that 's spoken is marred .
i kissed you before i killed you .
no way but this , killing myself , to die on a kiss .
i was afraid of this , but i thought he had no weapon ; he was great of heart .
o spartan dog , more evil than anguish , hunger , or the sea !
look on the tragic load on this bed ; this is your work .
the object of poison ’ s sight ; let it be hidden .
propn , keep the house , and seize on the fortunes of the propn , because they fall on you .
i myself will board the ship right away and go to the state to relate his heavy act with heavy heart .
now old desire lies in his deathbed , and young affection is longing to be his heir ; that beauty for which love groaned and would die , with tender propn matched now is n ’ t beautiful .
now propn is beloved , and loves again , both of them bewitched by the charm of looks ; but he must complain to his supposed enemy , and she must steal love 's sweet bait from fearful hooks .
gregory , on my word , we will not be humiliated , like carrying coal .
no , for that we should be coal miners .
i mean , if we are angry , we will draw our swords .
yeah , while you ’ re alive , you ’ ll only draw your neck out of the hangman ’ s collar .
i can hit quickly , if i ’ m motivated .
but you ’ re not quickly motivated to hit .
a dog of the house of propn motivates me .
makes no difference .
i will cut off their heads .
yes , the heads of maids , or their virginity .
take it any way you like .
it ’ s a good thing you ’ re not a fish .
it ’ s out already !
how ?
by running away ?
do n ’ t worry about me .
yeah right !
let ’ s do this legally .
let them start with us .
let them take it whatever way they will .
did you just give us the finger , sir ?
i did give the finger , sir .
did you give the finger to us , sir ?
no , sir , i did not give the finger to you , sir , but i did give the finger .
are you picking a fight with us , sir ?
fight , sir !
no , sir .
but if you do fight , sir , then i will fight you .
i work for as good a man as you do .
no better ?
well , sir .
say “ better . ” here comes one of propn ’ s relatives .
yes , better , sir .
you ’ re a liar !
you do n ’ t know what you ’ re doing !
what , is your sword out among these stupid servants ?
i ’ m only trying to keep the peace .
put your sword away , or use it to help me break up this fight .
fight me , coward !
clubs , pikes , and more pikes !
strike !
beat them down !
down with the capulets !
down with the montagues !
what ’ s going on ?
give me my long sword , hey !
you need a crutch , a crutch !
why do you want a sword ! ?
my sword , i say !
propn propn is out there , and waves his blade in spite of me .
to his wife ) do n ’ t hold me back – let me go !
you will not move one foot to fight !
rebellious subjects , enemies to peace .
three civil brawls , started by a meaningless comment , by you , old propn , and you , propn have three times disturbed the quiet of our streets and made propn ’ s senior citizens take out sober mementos of war and fighting , to use them again as weapons , in their old hands , rusted from not being used , as hate has rusted your families .
if ever you disturb our streets again , you will suffer the death penalty for breaking the peace .
once more , on pain of death , all men depart .
who started it this time ?
speak , nephew , where you there when it started ?
the servants of propn , and your servants , were fighting before i got there .
o , where is propn ?
have you seen him today .
i am very happy he was n ’ t at this fight .
i thought he was feeling the way i was , that many people are at their busiest when they ’ re alone , kept on walking and thinking , not worrying about him , and i gladly walked away from him who gladly fled from me .
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
i do n ’ t know and he wo n ’ t tell me .
have you questioned him at all ?
both myself and many other friend but he , advisor to his own affections , keeps it all to himself – i will not say how true but to himself , so secret and so close , so far from sounding and discovery , just like a flower bud bit by a worm jealous of its beauty before her can bloom and spread his sweet leaves to the air , or dedicate his beauty to the sun .
i wish you were happy to stay and hear his true confession .
come , madam , let ’ s leave .
good morning , cousin is it morning ?
it ’ s 9 am .
dear me !
sad hours seem long .
was that my father that went away so fast ?
it was .
what sadness lengthens propn 's hours ?
not having the thing that would make them short hours .
in love ?
out , of love ?
on the outs with the girl i love .
alas , that love , so gentle in his promise , should be so tyrannous and rough in reality !
alas , that love , whose eyes are blindfolded , should , without eyes , see ways to have his will done .
where should we eat ?
oh , me !
what fight was here ?
never mind , do n ’ t tell me , for i have heard it all .
o loving hate !
o anything of nothing first create !
o heavy lightness !
serious vanity !
propn - shapen disorder of perfectly pleasing forms !
feather of lead , bright smoke , cold fire , sick health !
this love feel i makes me feel no love in this .
why do n ’ t you laugh ?
no , cousin , i 'd rather cry .
good heart , at what ?
at your good heart 's oppression .
why , that is love 's transgression .
my own griefs lie heavy in my heart ; which you will take over to have it paired with more grief of your own .
this love that you have shown adds more grief to mine which is already too much .
love is like smoke rising with clouds of sighs ; being cleansed , a fire sparkling in lovers ' eyes ; being vexed , a sea nourished with lovers ' tears .
what else is it ?
a madness most discreet , a choking acid , and a preserving sweet .
propn , my coz .
hold on !
i ’ ll go along .
if you leave me so depressed , you do me wrong .
tut !
tell me in sadness who is that you love ?
what , shall i groan and tell you ?
propn ? !
why , no ; but sadly tell me who .
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
i thought so when i supposed you were in love .
a right good marksman !
and she 's fair who i love .
a right fair mark , fair coz , is the first hit .
well , in that hit , you miss .
she will not put up with loving language nor tolerate loving looks , nor does she care if a guy is rich .
o , she 's rich in beauty ; only poor that , when she dies , her beauty dies with her .
then she has sworn to remain a virgin ?
she has , and in that decision , is wasting her looks and charms ; for beauty , starved with this woman ’ s severity , propn beauty off from all posterity .
she is too fair , too wise ; wisely too fair , to earn her own happiness by making me despair .
she has sworn not to love ; and , in that vow , i am really dead as i stand here alive to tell you about it now .
listen to me , forget about her .
o , teach me how i should forget to think .
that way is to call her beauty , which is exquisite , more into question .
show me a mistress that is passing fair , what purpose does her beauty serve but as a reminder that i may see some other woman who can not pass her beauty ?
propn .
thou canst not teach me to forget .
i 'll prove you wrong , or else die trying .
but propn is the same restrictions as i am , the same penalty ; and it should not be hard , i think , for men so old as we to keep the peace .
of honorable status are you both ; and it ’ s a pity that you lived at odds so long .
but now , my lord , what say you to my request ?
younger girls than she are made happy mothers .
and too soon marred are those made young mothers .
the earth has swallowed all my hopes but she , she is the last hope i have .
but woo her , gentle propn , get her love .
this night i hold an old feast that i ’ ve always given , to which i have invited many guests , people i love ; and if you will be among the guests , you ’ ll be one more , most welcome , and will make my guests more .
at my poor house look to behold this night propn like earth - treading stars that make dark propn light .
they give such comfort as lusty young men feel when spring appears with all the flowers and warmth after a long , cold winter , even such delight among fresh female flower buds shall you this night find at my house ; hear all , all see , and like her most whose worth shall be the most .
which , among the many women , my daughter , being one , may stand out , though in my eyes , none can match her .
come , go with me .
it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his measuring tape and the tailor with his shoe form , the fisher with his pencil , and the painter with his nets ; but i am sent to find the people whose names are written here , and i can not read what names the writing person has written here .
i must find a reader .
in good time !
take some new infection to your eye , and the rank poison of the old love will die .
your plantain - leaf is excellent for that .
for what , please tell me ?
for your broken shin .
why , propn , are you crazy ?
not crazy , but more tied up than a madman is ; i am shut up in prison , kept without my food , whipped and tormented and— good day , good fellow .
good day .— please tell me , sir , can you read ?
yes , my own fortune in my misery .
perhaps you have learned it without book .
but please , can you read anything you see ?
yes , if i know the letters and the language .
you speak honestly .
have a nice day !
stay , fellow ; i can read .
where should they come ?
up .
where ?
to supper ; to our house .
whose house ?
my master 's .
indeed i should have asked you that before .
now i 'll tell you without asking .
my master is the great rich propn ; and if you are not of the house of montagues , please , come and have a cup of wine .
have a nice day !
at this same ancient feast of propn 's , the fair propn whom you love so much will have supper ; with all the admired beauties of propn .
let ’ s go , and , with a clear eye , compare her face with some others that i shall show you , and i will make you think your swan is a crow .
one fairer than my love ?
the all - seeing sun never saw anything to match her since the world first began .
i 'll go along , not to be shown such a sight , but to rejoice in splendor of my own love ’ s looks .
propn , where 's my daughter ?
call her to come to me .
now , by my virginity at twelve years old , i told her to come .
what , lamb !
what ladybird !
propn forbid !
where 's this girl ?
what , propn !
your mother .
propn , i am here .
what is do you need ?
this is the matter , nurse , leave us alone a while , we must talk in secret .
nurse , come back again ; i have remembered , you can hear our conversation .
you know my daughter 's at a pretty age .
believe me , i can tell her age to the hour .
she 's not fourteen .
i 'll bet fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to tell the truth , i ’ ve only got four , she is not fourteen .
how long is it now to the middle of propn ?
two weeks and a couple of days .
couple of days or not , of all days in the year , come the middle of propn , she ’ ll be fourteen .
my daughter , propn , and she propn rest all christian souls !
were the same age .
well , propn is with propn ; she was too good for me .
but , as i said , in the middle of propn , she ’ ll be fourteen ; that she will , by propn ; i remember it well .
it ’ s been eleven years since the earthquake ; and she was weaned , i never shall forget it , of all the days of the year , upon that day .
no , i do remember .
he was a merry man , took up the child .
look here , “ he said , “ did you fall on your face ?
i swear , if i should live a thousand yeas , i never should forget it ; ' wo n ’ t you , jule ?
yes , ” said my husband , ” you fell on your face ?
peace , i have done .
propn mark you for his grace !
you were the prettiest baby that i ever nursed .
if i live to see you married , i have my wish .
by propn , that “ marry ” is what i want to talk about .
tell me , daughter propn , what do you think about getting married ?
it is an honor that i never dreamed about .
well , think of marriage now .
younger than you , here in propn , ladies of esteem , are made already mothers .
by my count i was your mother pretty close to the age that you are now .
thus , then , here it is ; the valiant propn seeks you for his love .
a man , young lady !
lady , such a man as all the world why he 's the very image of a wax statue .
propn 's summer does not have such a flower of a man .
no , he 's a flower , i believe , a very flower .
what do you say ?
can you love the gentleman ?
the fish lives in the sea ; and it takes a lot of pride for beauty outside to hide without beauty inside .
this book in many girls ' eyes shares the glory , that with gold clips locks in the golden story ; so you will share all that he possesses , by having him , you are doing no less than making yourself .
no less ?
no , bigger !
women grow by men .
speak briefly , can you like propn ' love ?
i 'll look at him to like him , if , just by looking , i can like him , but i will not go any further than your consent gives my action strength to make it fly .
propn , the guests are come , supper served up , you are called , my young lady asked for , the nurse cursed in the pantry , and everything is in chaos .
we will follow you .
propn , the count is waiting .
go , girl , seek these happy nights to give you happy days .
what are we going to give as our excuse ?
or shall we just go on without any apology ?
the time is of such a boring duration .
no , gentle propn , we must have you dance .
not me , believe me .
you have dancing shoes , with nimble soles ; i have a soul of lead that pins me to the ground .
i can not move .
you are a lover ; borrow propn 's wings , and use them to soar above that leaden soul .
i am too sore from being pierced with propn ’ s shaft to soar with his wings ; and so wounded , i can not jump even a little bit above dull woe .
under love 's heavy burden , i would sink .
and , to sink in it , you should outweigh love ; too great oppression for a tender feeling .
is love a tender thing ?
it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous ; and it pricks like thorn .
give me my mask .
a fig for a mask !
what do i care what curious eye lists my deformities ?
here are the long , black eyebrows that shall blush for me .
come , knock and enter ; and , as soon as we get in , every man start running .
just give me a torch .
let spoiled children , light of heart , tickle the senseless weeds with their running and dancing ; for i am composing proverbs with a grandfather ’ s words , i 'll be a candle - holder and look on , the game was never any fun and i am done .
propn , propn 's the brownish color of a mouse , the constable 's own word .
no , that 's not so .
i mean , sir , in delaying our entrance , we waste our lights in vain , like lamps by day .
take our good meaning , for our judgment sits five times more in that sense , than once in our five wits .
and we mean well , in going to this masquerade ; but it ’ s no great sport to go .
why , may one ask ?
i dreamt a dream tonight .
and so did i .
well , what was yours ?
that dreamers often lie .
in bed asleep , while they do dream about things are true .
o , then , i see propn propn hath been with you .
sometime she drives over a soldier 's neck , and then he dreams of cutting foreign throats , of infractions , sneak attacks , spanish swords , of safety five fathoms deep in the sea ; and then soon he hears drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes ; and , being thus frightened , swears a prayer or two , and sleeps again .
this is that very propn that braids the manes of horses in the night ; and bakes tangled messes of hair into foul dirty hairs , which , once untangled , signals the beginning of much misfortune .
true , i talk of dreams , which are the children of an idle brain , born of nothing but vain fantasy ; which is as thin of substance as the air , and more inconstant than the wind , who courts , even now , the frozen heart of the north , and , being angered , puffs away from there , turning his face to the dew - dropping south .
this wind you talk of blows us from our party crashing .
supper is done , and we shall come too late .
but propn who has the plan of my journey on this sea , direct my sail !
on , lusty gentlemen !
strike the drum .
where 's propn , that he does n ’ t help with cleaning up ?
move the plates !
propn the plates !
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men 's hands , and they unwashed too , it ’ s a foul thing .
away with the good stools , remove the china closet , look to the plate .
please save me a piece of marzipan ; and because you love me , let the porter let in propn propn and propn .
yes , boy , ready .
you are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for in the great chamber .
welcome , gentlemen !
ladies whose toes are not plagued with corns will have a dance with you .
ah ha , my mistresses !
which one of you all will now deny to dance ?
she that makes dainty and shy , she , i 'll swear has corns !
am i to come near you now ?
welcome , gentlemen !
you are welcome , gentlemen !
come , musicians , play .
a hall a hall !
make room !
ah , propn , this unlooked - for sport comes well .
by our propn , thirty years .
what , man !
it ’ s since the wedding of propn , come propn as quickly as it will , it ’ s some five - and - twenty years since we masked .
it ’ s more , it ’ s more .
his son is older , sir ; his son is thirty .
will you tell me that ?
his son was but a ward two years ago .
what lady is that , who make the hand of that knight richer ?
i know not , sir .
o , she teaches the torches to burn bright !
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an propn ’ s ear ; propn too rich for use , for earth too dear !
so a snowy dove trooping with crows shows as yonder lady over her fellows shows .
the dance done , i 'll watch to see where she ’ ll stand , and , touching her hand , will make blessed my rude hand .
did my heart love till now ?
renounce it , sight !
for i never saw true beauty till this night .
this , by his voice , should be a propn .
fetch me my rapier , boy .
what , dares the slave come hither , covered with a mask , to sneer and scorn at our feast ?
now , by the stock and honor of my kin , i do n ’ t think it ’ s a sin to strike him dead .
why , what , kinsman !
why do you storm so ?
propn , this is a propn , our foe ; a villain , that has come here in spite , to scorn at our feast this night .
propn propn , is it ?
it is he , that villain , propn .
be content , gentle cousin , leave him alone .
he bears himself like a portly gentleman ; and , to say truth , propn brags of him to be a virtuous and well - governed youth .
i would not for the wealth of all the town do him disrespect here in my house .
therefore be patient , take no note of him , it is my will .
if you respect my will , then show a fair presence and put off these frowns , they are not the proper expressions for a feast .
it fits , when such a villain is a guest .
what , good lord , boy !
am i the master here or you ?
come on ! .
you 'll not endure him !
you will be boastful !
you 'll be the man !
why , uncle , it ’ s a shame .
come on , come on !
you are a saucy boy .
is it so , indeed ?
you must contradict me !
i 'll make you quiet .
patience perhaps meeting with a willful temper makes my flesh tremble in their differences .
i will withdraw , but this intrusion shall , now seeming sweet , convert to bitter acid .
if i desecrate with my most unworthy hand this holy shrine of your hand , the gentle end is this , my lips , like two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
good pilgrim , you wrong your hand too much , which is showing devotion and good manners in this touch ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands touch , and putting a palm to another palm is a holy pilgrim 's kiss .
do n ’ t saints and holy pilgrims have lips too ?
yes , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
saints do not move , though they do grant favors for prayers ' sake .
then do n ’ t move while i take my prayer 's answer .
thus from my lips , by your lips , my sin is purged .
then , do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours ? .
sin from my lips ?
o sin sweetly encouraged !
give me my sin again .
you kiss by the book .
propn , your mother craves a word with you .
who is her mother ?
by propn , young man , her mother is the lady of the house .
and a good lady , and a wise and virtuous lady .
is she a propn ?
o dear account !
now i am in debt to my enemy .
let ’ s go , we ’ re leaving ; our party - crashing is done .
yes , so i fear ; and my fears are more than they were .
i ca n ’ t change your mind ?
more torches here !
come on then , let 's go to bed .
ah , propn [ to 2 propn ] , by my faith , it grows late ; i 'm going to sleep .
come here , nurse .
who is that gentleman over there ?
the son and heir of old propn .
who is he that is going out the door now ?
by propn , that , i think , is young propn .
who is he that follows there , the one who would n ’ t dance ?
i do n ’ t know .
his name is propn , and a propn ; the only son of your great enemy .
my only love sprung from my only hate !
seen too early as an unknown , and now known too late !
it is a monstrous birth of love to me , that i must love a loathéd enemy .
what 's this ?
what 's this ?
a rhyme i learned even now from someone i could n ’ t dance with .
again , again !
come , let 's go ; all the strangers are gone .
the clock struck nine when i sent the nurse ; she promised to return in half an hour .
maybe she ca n ’ t meet him .
that 's not true .
o , she is lame !
love 's heralds should be thoughts , which glide ten times faster than the sun 's beams , driving back shadows over lowering hills .
this way doves with nimble wings draw love , and that ’ s why the wind - swift propn has wings .
now is the sun upon the highest hill of this day 's journey , and from nine till twelve is three long hours , yet she ’ s not back .
o propn , she comes !
o honey nurse , what news ?
have you met with him ?
send your man away .
propn , stay at the gate .
now , good sweet nurse , o propn , why do you look sad ?
what a jaunt i have had !
i wish you had my bones , and i had your news .
propn , what ’ s your hurry ?
ca n ’ t you rest awhile ?
do n ’ t you see that i ’ m out of breath ?
how are you out of breath , when you have breath to say to me that you are out of breath ?
the excuse that you make in this delay is longer than the tale you excuse .
is your news good or bad ?
answer that .
say either good or bad , and i 'll wait for the details .
let me be satisfied , is it good or bad ?
propn !
he is not the flower of courtesy , but i 'll guarantee that he is as gentle as a lamb .
go about your business , wench ; serve propn .
what , have you dined at home ?
what does he say about our marriage ?
what of that ?
propn , how my head aches !
what a head i ’ ve got !
it throbs as if it ’ s going to fall into twenty pieces .
my back on the other side , o , my back , my back !
curse your heart for sending me out to catch my death with prancing up and down !
in faith , i am sorry that you ’ re not well .
sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what does my love say ?
your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome ; and , i guarantee , a virtuous gentleman where is your mother ?
where is my mother ?
why , she ’ s inside .
where should she be ?
how oddly you reply !
your love says , like an honest gentleman , ” where is your mother ? ” o propn 's lady dear !
are you so hot ?
from this time forward , do your messages yourself .
here 's such a choice !
come , what does propn say ?
have you got permission to go to confession today ?
i have .
then go quickly to propn propn ' cell ; a husband waits there to make you a wife .
now comes the lusty blood up in your cheeks , they 'll be bright red instantly at any news .
go quickly to church ; i must go another way , to fetch a ladder , by the which your love must climb to a bird 's nest soon , when it is dark .
i am the slave and worker in your delight ; but you shall bear the burden soon at night .
go on ; i 'll go to dinner ; go quickly to the cell .
go quickly to high fortune !
honest nurse , farewell .
can i go home when my heart is here ?
turn back , dull earth , and find out where your center is .
propn !
he is wise ; and , on my life , he has stolen home to bed .
he ran this way , and leaped over this orchard wall .
call him , good propn .
no , i 'll conjure him up too .
propn !
humors !
propn !
passion !
propn !
appear in the likeness of a sigh .
speak but one rhyme , and i am satisfied ; cry but “ ah me ! ” pronounce but “ love ” and “ dove ; ” speak one fair word to my godmother propn , one nickname for her almost blind son and heir , young auburn propn , he that shot the arrow so well when propn propn loved the beggar - maid !
he does n ’ t hear , he does n ’ t make noise , he does n ’ t move ; the fool is dead , and i must conjure him up !
if he hears you , you will make him angry .
this can not anger him .
it would anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress ' circle , of some strange nature , letting it stand there until she had laid it down , and conjured it down .
my invocation is fair and honest , and , in his mistress ' name , i only conjure him to raise up him .
come , he has hidden himself among these trees , to have a sexual liaison with the moody night .
his love is blind and it suits the dark best .
if love is blind , love ca n ’ t find the spot .
now he ’ ll sit under a medlar tree , and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone .
propn , good night .
i 'm going to my pull - out bed ; this field - bed is too cold for me to sleep in .
come on , shall we go ?
go then ; for it ’ s useless to look for him here when he intends not to be found .
he laughs at the scars of love when he ’ s never felt love ’ s pain .
quiet !
what light breaks through that window ?
it is the east , and propn is the sun rising !
arise , fair sun , and kill the jealous moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , that you , her maid , are far more beautiful than she is .
do n ’ t be her maid , since she is so jealous .
her chaste , white gown is only sick and green , and only fools wear it .
take it off and throw it away .
it is my lady ; o , it is my love !
o , i wish she knew that she was my love !
she speaks , but she says nothing .
what does that mean ?
i am too bold , she ’ s not speaking to me .
two of the fairest stars in all the propn , having some business , do beg her eyes to twinkle in their sockets till the stars return .
what if her eyes were there , they in her head ?
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars , as daylight shames a lamp ; her eyes in propn would stream so brightly through the skies that birds would sing and think it was morning .
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand !
o i wish i were a glove on that hand so that i might touch that cheek !
ah me !
she speaks .
o , speak again , bright angel !
for you are as glorious to this night , that is over my head , as is a wingéd messenger of propn to the white , upturned , wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he crosses the slow moving clouds and sails upon the heart of the wind .
o propn , propn !
shall i hear more , or shall i speak at this ?
o , be some other name !
what 's in a name ?
that which we call a rose would smell as sweet if it had any other name .
so propn , if he was n ’ t called “ propn , ” would retain that dear perfection which he has without that title .
propn , throw your name away ; and for that name , which is n ’ t part of you , take all of me .
i take you at your word .
only call me “ love , ” and i 'll be baptized with a new name .
from now on , i ’ ll never be “ propn . ” what man are you who , wrapped in the cover of night , propn on my private thoughts ?
by a name that i do n ’ t know how to tell you who i am .
my name , dear saint , is hateful to me because it is an enemy to you .
if i had written it down on paper , i would tear the word from the page .
my ears have n ’ t yet heard a hundred words of that tongue 's speech , and yet i know the sound ; are n ’ t you propn , and a propn ?
how did you come here , tell me , and why ?
if they see you , they will murder you .
it ’ s a shame , there is more danger in your eye than twenty of their swords .
if you will just look sweet , then i am protected against their hate .
i would n ’ t have them see you here for the world .
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their sight ; and , if you love me , let them find me here .
my life were better ended by their hate than death postponed , wanting your love .
who gave you the directions to this place ?
i am no sea captain , but , if you were as far away as that vast shore washed with the furthest sea , i would risk everything for such a cargo .
you know that the night hides my face ; otherwise , a maiden ’ s blush would paint my cheek for what you overheard me say tonight .
gladly i would dwell on form , gladly , gladly deny what i have spoken ; but farewell polite words !
do you love me ?
i know you will say , “ yes , ” and i will take your word .
but , if you swear , you may prove false .
at lovers ' lies , they say propn laughs .
o gentle propn , if you do love , pronounce it faithfully .
i should have been more unfriendly , i must confess , but you overheard , before i was aware of you , my true love ’ s passion .
therefore , pardon me , and not attribute this surrender to light love , which the dark night has discovered .
propn , by the blessed moon up there , that tips with silver all these fruit - tree tops , i swear o , do n ’ t swear by the moon , the inconstant moon , that monthly goes through changes in her circled orbit , for fear that your love prove as variable as the moon .
what shall i swear by ?
do n ’ t swear at all ; or if you will , swear by your own gracious self , which is the god that i worship , and i 'll believe you .
if my heart 's dear love , well , do n ’ t swear .
this bud of love , ripen by summer 's breezes , may become a beautiful flower when next we meet .
good night , good night !
may sweet repose and rest come to your heart such as that is within my breast !
o , will you leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction can you have tonight ?
the exchange of your love 's faithful vow for mine .
i gave you my vow before you asked for it , and yet , i wish i could give it again .
would you take it away ?
why , love ?
only to be honest and give it to you again .
and still i wish but for the thing that i already have .
my treasure has no boundaries , just like the sea , my love is as deep as the sea ; the more i give to you , the more i have , for both my love and the sea are infinite .
i hear some noise within .
dear love , goodbye !
right away , good nurse !
propn propn , be true .
stay here a minute .
o blessed , blessed night !
i am afraid , standing in this night , that all this is only a dream , too promising and sweet to be real .
three words , dear propn , and good night indeed .
if that your love is honorable , your intention marriage , send me word tomorrow , by one that i 'll get to come to you , where and what time you will marry me , and i ’ ll lay all my fortunes at your feet , and follow you , my lord , throughout the world .
propn !
but if you do n ’ t mean well , i beg you , propn !
i ’ m coming to end your pursuit of me and leave me to my grief .
i ’ ll send tomorrow .
i ’ ll be waiting , a thousand times good night !
a thousand times the worse for me , to want your light !
love goes toward love as schoolboy away from their books ; but love goes from love , like boys towards school with heavy looks .
listen , propn , listen !
o i wish i had a falconer 's voice to lure this hawk back to me again !
being a slave has a hoarse voice and may not speak aloud ; or else i would go to the cave where propn lives , and make her airy voice more hoarse than mine is , with the repetition of my propn 's name .
it is my soul that calls my name .
how silver - sweet is the sound of lovers ' voices by night , like softest music to listening ears !
propn !
my dear ?
what time tomorrow should i send someone to you ?
at nine .
i will not fail !
it ’ s going feel like twenty years until then .
i have forgotten why i called you back .
let me stand here until you remember .
i shall forget just to have you stand there , remembering how i love your company .
and i 'll still stay , to have you still forget , forgetting any other home but this one .
i wish i were your bird .
sweet , so do i .
but i should kill you with much cherishing .
good night , good night !
parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night until it ’ s tomorrow .
sleep dwell upon your eyes , peace in your breast !
i wish i were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest !
i will go right away to my ghostly priest 's house , to get his help and to tell him about my dear good fortune .
the grey - eyed morning smiles on the frowning night , cutting the eastern clouds into squares with streaks of light ; and the flecked darkness reels like a drunkard from the day 's path and the sun ’ s hot rays .
no , before the sun advances his burning eye , to cheer the day and to dry night 's dank dew , i must fill up this , our cage made of reeds with baleful weeds and precious - juiced flowers .
the earth , that is , nature 's mother , is nature ’ s tomb .
the grave where she ’ s buried , that is also her womb , and , from her womb , we find children of diverse kinds when we are sucking on her natural bosom ; many plants are excellent for many virtues , some have none , others have some , but are all different .
virtue itself can turn to vice , if it is misapplied ; and vice is sometimes dignified by action .
two such opposed kings set up camp in man , as well as in herbs , grace and rude will ; and where the worse human trait is predominant , the canker death eats up that plant very soon .
good morning , father !
bless you !
what early tongue so sweetly salutes me ?
young son , it is arguably a distempered head that bids good morning so soon to your bed .
care keeps his watch in every old man 's eye , and , where care lodges , sleep will never lie ; but where a perfect youth with an empty brain rests his limbs , golden sleep reigns there .
therefore your earliness assures me that you are aroused by some disturbance in your mind ; or if that ’ s not it , then i guess right , our propn has not been in bed tonight .
that last part is true ; my rest was the sweeter .
propn pardon sin !
were you with propn ?
with propn , my ghostly father ?
no !
i have forgotten that name , and that name 's pain .
i 'll tell you before you ask me again .
i have been feasting with my enemy ; where , all of a sudden , one has wounded me that 's by me also wounded .
propn propn propn !
what a change this is !
is propn , who you did love so dearly , so soon forsaken ?
young men 's love , then , lies not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
how much salt water was thrown away in waste , to season love , that did not taste love !
if ever you were yourself , and these woes yours , you and these woes were all for propn .
and are you changed ?
pronounce this sentence then propn may fall when there 's no strength in men .
you often scolded me for loving propn .
for doting , not for loving , my pupil .
and you told me bury love .
not in a grave to lay one in , and take another out .
please do n ’ t scold me .
she whom i love now has grace for grace and love for love allowed .
the other one did n ’ t .
but come , young waverer , come go with me .
wisely , and slowly .
they stumble that run fast .
where the devil can this propn be ?
did n ’ t he come home tonight ?
ah , that same pale hard - hearted wench , that propn , propn him so that he will sure run mad .
propn , the kinsman to old propn , has sent a letter to his father 's house .
a challenge , on my life .
propn will answer it .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
no , he will answer the letter 's writer , how he dares being dared .
propn propn , he is already dead !
why , what is propn ?
more than propn of propn , i can tell you .
o , he 's the courageous captain of compliments .
he fights as you sing prick - song keeps time , distance , and proportion ; rests his minimum rest .
ah , the immortal forward thrust !
the back - handed thrust !
the hay .
the what ?
the pox of such antic , lisping , affecting absurd and irrational people ; these new tuners of accents !
by propn , a very good blade !
a very tall man !
o , their bones , their bones !
without his fish eggs , like a dried herring .
o flesh , flesh , how are you fishified !
now he is for the numbers that propn flowed in !
there 's a french salutation to your french slop .
you gave us a good false impression last night .
good morning to you both .
what false impression did i give you ?
that 's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bend his legs .
meaning , to good manners ?
thou hast most kindly hit it .
a most courteous exposition .
no , i am the very small spot of courtesy .
pink for flower .
right .
why , then my shoe is well - flowered .
well said .
follow me in this joke now until you have worn out your shoe ; that , when the single sole of it is worn , the joke may remain , after the wearing , sole singular .
o single - soled joke , only singular for the singleness !
at full speed , at full speed ; or i 'll cry a match .
no , if your wits run the wild - goose chase , i ’ m done , because you have more of the wild - goose in one of your wits than , i am sure , i have in my whole five .
was i with you there for the goose ?
you were never with me for anything when you were not there for the goose .
i will bite you on the ear for that joke !
no , good goose , do n ’ t bite .
your wit is a very bitter sweetness ; it is a most sharp sauce .
and is n ’ t , then , well served with a sweet goose ?
o , here 's a wit of kid leather , that stretches from an inch narrow to 45 inches wide !
i stretch it out for that word “ broad , ” which added to the goose , proves you far and wide a broad goose .
why , is n ’ t this better now than groaning for love ?
now , you ’ re sociable ; now you ’ re propn ; now you are what you are , by art as well as by nature .
for this idiotic love is like a great natural fool that runs lolling up and down to hide his toy in a hole .
stop there , stop there .
you want me to stop in my tale against the hair .
otherwise , you would have made your tale large .
here 's some good stuff !
a sail , a sail , a sail !
propn !
right away .
my fan , propn .
propn propn , to hide her face , for her fan has the fairer face .
good morning , gentlemen .
good evening , fair gentlewoman .
is it good evening ?
it ’ s no less , i tell you , for the bawdy hand of the clock is now upon the prick of noon .
shame on you !
what kind of a man are you !
one , gentlewoman , that propn has made for himself to damage .
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young propn ?
i can tell you , but “ young ” propn will be older when you have found him than he was when you asked for him .
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse name .
you say well .
yeah , is the worst well ?
if you be he , sir , i desire some confidence with you .
she will give him a written invitation to some supper .
a hare , a hare , a hare !
so ho !
what have you found ?
an old gray hare , and an old gray hare , is very good meat in propn ; but a hare that is gray is too much to be billed when it ages before it used up .
propn , will you come to your father 's ?
we 'll have dinner there .
i will follow you .
by propn , farewell !
please , sir , what rude salesman was this that was so full of his own trickery ?
a gentleman , nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than you think should do for a month .
if he speaks anything against me , i 'll take him down , even if he were lustier than he is , and twenty such jacks ; and if i can not , i 'll find those that shall .
scurvy knave !
and you just stand by too , and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure !
i would draw as soon as another man , if i see occasion in a good quarrel , and the law on my side .
now , before propn , i am so annoyed that every part about me quivers .
scurvy knave !
nurse , commend me to your lady and mistress .
i must protest your comments good heart , and in faith i will tell her as much .
what will you tell her , nurse ?
you do n ’ t understand me .
bid her devise some means to come to confession this afternoon ; and there she shall , at propn propn ' cell , make her confession and married .
here is something for your pains .
no , truly , sir ; not a penny .
this afternoon , sir ?
well , she ’ ll be there .
and wait , good nurse , behind the abbey wall .
within this hour , my man shall be with you , and bring you a rope ladder ; which must be my way to the highest point of my joy in the secret night .
now propn in propn bless you !
listen , sir .
what did you say , my dear nurse ?
can your man keep a secret ?
have you never heard the saying , two may keep counsel , putting the other one away ?
i guarantee you , my man is as true as steel .
well , sir ; my mistress is the sweetest lady .
propn , propn !
when she was a little chatterbox , o , there 's a nobleman in town , one propn , that would gladly like her attention ; but she , good soul , would rather see a toad , a very toad , than to see him .
i anger her sometimes , and tell her that propn is the more proper man ; but i 'll guarantee you , when i say so , she looks as pale as any linen in the whole , wide world .
does n ’ t “ rosemary ” and “ propn ” begin with the same letter ?
yes , nurse ; what of that ?
both begin with an propn propn , joker !
that 's the dog 's name .
commend me to your lady .
yes , a thousand times .
exit propn .
yes ?
propn , take my fan , and go before me .
so the heavens smile upon this holy act that after - hours will not scold us with sorrow !
amen , amen !
but whatever sorrow can come , it can not equal the exchange of joy that one short minute in her sight gives me .
you only have to close our hands with holy words , then love - devouring death can do whatever he dares it is enough that i may call her mine .
these violent delights have violent ends , and in their triumph die , like fire and powder , which , as they kiss , consume each other .
the sweetest honey is loathsome in its own deliciousness , and in the taste destroys the appetite .
here comes the lady .
o , so light a foot will never wear out the everlasting sharpening stone .
good evening to my ghostly confessor .
propn shall thank you , daughter , for us both .
as much to him , otherwise his thanks is too much .
ah , propn , if the amount of your joy is heaped up like mine , and that your sense of right be more to adorn it with , then sweeten this neighboring air with your breath , and let rich music 's language propn the imagined happiness that we both receive in this dear meeting .
come , come with me , and we will be quick , because , by your permission , you shall not stay alone until holy church incorporates the two of you into one .
please , good propn , let 's go home .
you are like one of these fellows that , when he enters the bar , throws his sword upon the table , and says ” propn , i do n ’ t want to use you ! ” and by the time he ’ s drunk the second cup draws the sword on the table , when , indeed , there is no need .
am i like such a fellow ?
come on , you are as hot as any fellow in your mood as anyone else in propn ; and you are soon moved to be moody , and soon moody to be moved .
and to what ?
no , if there were two such fellows , we should have none shortly , because one would kill the other .
you !
why , you will quarrel with a man that has a hair more or a hair less in his beard than you have .
your head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat ; and your head has even been beaten like a rotten egg for quarrelling .
you have quarreled with a man for coughing in the street , because he woke up your dog that was asleep in the sun .
and yet you will teach me to avoid quarrelling ? !
if i were so easy to quarrel as you are , any man should buy the inherited estate of my life for an hour and a quarter .
the inherited estate !
o how honest !
by my head , here come the capulets .
by my heel , i care not .
follow me close , because i will speak to them .
only one word with one of us ?
couple it with something ; make it a word and a blow .
you shall find me easy enough for that , sir , if you will give me the opportunity .
could n ’ t you take some opportunity without my giving you one ?
propn , you hang out with propn , hang out !
what , do you make us musicians ?
if you make us musicians , look to hear nothing but noise .
we ’ re talking here in a public place .
well , peace be with you , sir .
here comes my man .
but i 'll be hanged , sir , if he will put up with your insults .
by propn , go before him to field , he 'll be your follower .
your honor , in that sense , may call him a man .
propn , the reason that i have to love you does excuse very much the rage that is appropriate for such a greeting .
i am not a villain .
therefore , farewell .
i see that you do n ’ t know me .
boy , this walking away shall not excuse the injuries that you have done to me ; therefore , turn and draw your sword .
o calm , dishonorable , vile submission !
to choke carries it away .
propn , you rat - catcher , will you walk away ?
what would you have with me ?
will you pluck your sword out of its holder by the handle ?
hurry up , for fear my sword will be about your ears before you get yours out .
i am for you .
propn propn , put up your sword .
come , sir , your forward thrust .
propn , for shame !
control this anger !
propn , propn , the prince has expressly forbidden this fighting in propn streets .
hold , tybalt !
good propn !
i am finished .
is he gone , and he has nothing ?
what , are you hurt ?
where is my page ?
go , villain , get a doctor .
no , it ’ s not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door ; but it ’ s enough , it will do .
ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
i am not long , i guarantee , for this world .
a plague on both your houses !
a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat , to scratch a man to death !
a braggart , a rogue , a villain , that fights by the book of arithmetic !
to propn ] why the devil did you come between us ?
i was hurt under your arm .
i thought it was all for the best .
help me into some house , propn , or i shall faint .
a plague on both your houses !
they have made meat for the worms out meat of me .
i have had it , and soundly too .
your houses !
that gallant spirit has gone into the clouds , which saw an untimely death here on earth .
here comes the furious propn back again .
propn , go away to propn , and fire - eyed fury be my guide now !
now , propn , take back again the word “ villain ” that you just gave me ; for propn 's soul is only a little way above our heads , waiting for yours to keep him company .
either you or i , or both of us , must go with him .
you , wretched boy , that hung out with him here , will be with him there .
this fight shall determine that .
propn , leave , be gone !
the citizens are up , and propn is dead .
do n ’ t stand there in shock .
the prince will sentence you to death if you are taken prisoner .
get going , get out of here , leave !
o , i am fool for the goddess of luck !
why do you stay ?
which way did he who killed propn run ?
propn , that murderer , which way did he run ?
there lies that same propn .
where are the wicked beginners of this fight ?
there lies the man slain by young propn , that killed your kinsman , brave propn .
propn , my cousin !
o my brother 's child !
o prince !
o husband !
o , the blood of my dear kinsman is spilled !
propn , as you are true , for blood of ours shed blood of propn .
o cousin , cousin !
propn , who began this bloody fight ?
propn , here killed , who was slain by propn ’ s hand .
propn spoke nicely to him , asked him to consider how silly the quarrel was , and in addition , advised him of your high displeasure .
romeo cries aloud , ” stop , friends !
this is the truth , or let propn die .
some twenty of them fought in this black fight , and all those twenty could only take one life .
i beg for justice , which you , prince , must give ; propn killed propn .
propn must not live .
propn killed him ; he killed propn .
who now owes the price of his dear blood ?
not propn , prince ; he was propn 's friend ; his mistake finishes only what the law should end , the life of propn .
and for that offence we immediately exile him from here .
i have an interest in your hate 's proceeding , my blood for your rude brawls lies there bleeding ; but i 'll punish you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent my loss .
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses , nor shall tears or prayers buy your way out .
therefore , use none .
let propn go quickly away from here , or else , when he is found , that hour is his last .
bear this body away , and wait for our instructions .
mercy only murders us , pardoning those that kill .
propn quickly , you horses with fiery flames for feet , towards the propn god ’ s house .
such a wagon driver as propn ( the son of the propn god ) would whip you to the west and bring in a cloudy night immediately .
close your curtain , love - performing night , so that rude eyes may look away , and propn can propn to these arms , un - talked about and unseen .
come , civil night , you sober - suited matron , all in black , and teach me how to lose a winning match , played for a pair of stainless maidens .
conceal my virgin blood , fluttering in my cheeks , with your black mantle , until unknown love , grown bold , thinks that true love is an act of simple modesty .
come , gentle night ; come , loving , black - browed night , give me my propn ; and , when he shall die , take him and cut him out in little stars , and he will make the face of propn so fine that all the world will be in love with night , and pay no worship to the glaring sun .
o , i have bought the mansion of a love , but i have not moved in , and , though i am sold , i have not yet been enjoyed .
so boring this day is , as the night before some festival is to an impatient child that has new clothes , and ca n ’ t wear them .
what have you got there ?
the ropes that propn asked you to fetch ?
yes , yes , the ropes .
ah me !
what news ?
why are you wringing your hands ?
ah , alas !
he 's dead , he 's dead , he 's dead !
we are ruined , lady , we are ruined !
shame on this day !
he 's gone , he 's killed , he 's dead !
can propn be so jealous ?
propn can , though propn can not .
o propn , propn !
who ever would have thought it ?
propn !
what devil are you that torments me like this ?
this torture should make a loud noise in dismal hell .
has propn killed himself ?
you say only “ i , ” and i shall poison that bare vowel more than the death - darting eye of the serpent hatched from an egg .
i am not “ i , ” if there be such an “ i , ” or those eyes shut that make you answer “ i . ” if he is slain , say “ i ; ” or if not , say “ no . ” brief sounds determine my wealth or sorrows .
here on his manly breast .
o , break , my heart !
poor bankrupt , break at once !
evil earth , die ; end all motion here ; and you and propn lay in a heavy tomb !
o courteous tybalt !
what kind of storm is this that blows so opposed to nature ?
is propn slaughtered , and is tybalt dead ?
my dear - loved cousin , and my dearer lord ?
then , dreadful trumpet , sound the general doom !
for who is living , if those two are gone ?
propn is gone , and propn banished ; propn killed him ; he is banished .
o propn !
did propn 's hand shed propn 's blood ?
o serpent heart , hidden by a handsome face !
did a dragon ever keep so beautiful a cave ?
beautiful tyrant !
fiend angelical !
propn - feathered raven !
wolfish - rabid lamb !
despised substance of the most divine show !
just opposite to what you justly seem , a damned saint , an honorable villain !
o nature , what did you have to do in hell when you sheltered the spirit of a fiend in a deadly paradise of such sweet flesh ?
was there ever a book containing such vile matter so beautifully bound ?
o , that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace !
there 's no trust , no faith , no honesty in men ; all are liars , all swear falsely , all nothing , all deceivers .
ah , where 's my man ?
give me some whiskey .
these griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
shame come to propn !
your tongue should be blistered for such a wish !
he was not born to shame .
upon his brow , shame is ashamed to sit ; for it ’ s a throne where honor may be crowned the only king of the universal earth .
o , what a beast was i to scold him !
will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband ?
ah , poor my lord , what tongue shall clear your name , when i , your wife for three hours , have mangled it ?
but why , villain , did you kill my cousin ?
that villain cousin would have killed my husband .
back , foolish tears , back to your native spring .
your drops of tribute belong to sorrow , which you , mistaken , have offered up to joy .
my husband lives , that propn would have slain , and propn 's dead , that would have slain my husband .
some word there was , worse than propn 's death , that murdered me .
i would gladly forget it , but , o , it presses into my memory like damned guilty deeds press into sinners ' minds .
tybalt is dead , and propn banished . ” that “ banished , ” that one word “ banished , ” has killed ten thousand tybalts .
but with a rear - ward following propn 's death , ” propn is banished . ” to speak that word is father , mother , propn , propn , propn , all slain , all dead .
where are my father and my mother , nurse ?
weeping and wailing over propn 's corpse .
will you go to them ?
i will bring you there .
they wash his wounds with tears .
my tears shall be spent , when theirs are dry , for propn 's banishment .
take up those ropes .
poor ropes , you are deceived , both you and i ; for propn is exiled .
he made you to be a highway to my bed ; but i , a maid , die a maiden and a widow .
hurry to your chamber .
i 'll find propn to comfort you .
i know well where he is .
you listen : your propn will be here at night .
i 'll go to him ; he is hidden at propn ' cell .
o , find him !
give this ring to my true knight , and bid him come to take his last farewell .
propn , come here ; come here , you fearful man .
affliction is in love of your parts , and you are married to calamity .
propn , what news ?
what is the prince 's sentence ?
what sorrow craves to know me at my hand , that i do n ’ t know yet ?
my dear son is too familiar with such sour company .
i bring you news of the prince 's sentence .
what less than the end of the world is the prince 's sentence ?
a gentler judgment vanished from his lips , not your body 's death , but your body 's banishment .
what , banishment ?
be merciful , say death ; for exile has more terror in his look , much more than death ; do not say banishment .
you are banished away from propn .
be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
there is no world without propn walls , only purgatory , torture , hell itself .
calling death banishment , you cut my head off with a golden axe , and smile on the stroke that murders me .
o deadly sin !
o rude unthankfulness !
your fault our law calls death ; but the kind prince , taking your part , has brushed aside the law , and turned that black word “ death ” to banishment .
this is dear mercy , and you do n ’ t see it .
it ’ s torture , and not mercy .
propn is here , where propn lives , and every cat , and dog , and little mouse , every unworthy thing , live here in propn , and may look on her ; but propn may not .
more legal authority , more honorable state , more courtship lives in flies on dead meat than propn .
flies may do this , when i must fly from this .
and you still say that exile is not death !
o , you will speak again of banishment .
again “ banished ? ” stop with the philosophy !
unless philosophy can make a propn , propn a town , reverse a prince 's sentence , it does n ’ t help , it does n ’ t succeed .
talk no more .
o , then i see that madmen have no ears .
how should they , when wise men have no eyes ?
let me argue with you about your situation .
you ca n ’ t speak about something you do n ’ t feel .
if you were as young as i , propn your love , married only an hour , propn murdered , propn like me , and , like me , banished , then you might speak , then you might tear your hair , and fall upon the ground , as i do now , thinking about an unmade grave .
propn propn , hide yourself .
not i ; unless the breath of heartsick groans , like a mist wraps me up and hides me from the search of eyes .
listen , how they knock !
who 's there ?
who knocks so hard ?
where do you come from ?
what do you want ?
welcome then .
there on the ground , made drunk with his own tears .
o , it ’ s the same in my mistress ' case , just in her case !
o sad sympathy !
pitiful situation !
she lies the same way , propn and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
ah sir !
ah sir !
well , death 's the end of us all .
did you speak of propn ?
how is it with her ?
does n ’ t she think i ’ m an old murderer , now i have stained the beginning of our joy with blood from a close relative ?
where is she ?
and how is she doing ?
and what says my hidden lady to our canceled love ?
o , she says nothing , sir , but weeps and weeps ; and now falls on her bed ; and then starts up , and calls propn , and then cries over propn , and then falls down again .
as if that name of propn , propn from the deadly level of a gun , murdered her the same way as that name 's cursed hand murdered her kinsman .
o , tell me , friar , tell me , in what vile part of this anatomy does my name live ?
tell me , that i may rip the hateful mansion apart .
hold your desperate hand .
are you a man ?
or ill - beseeming beast in seeming both !
you have amazed me .
by my holy order , i thought your disposition was of a better temper .
have you killed propn ?
will you kill yourself ?
and kill your lady , too , who lives in you , by doing damned hate to yourself ?
why do you complain about your birth , the propn , and earth ?
since birth is propn and propn is earth , all three meet in you at once , which you would lose at once .
your noble shape is only a form of wax , deviating from the valor of a man ; your dear love sworn is empty lies , killing that love which you have vowed to cherish ; your wit , that ornament to shape and love , disfigured in the conduct of them both , like powder in a recruit soldier 's flask , is set a - fire by your own ignorance , and you dismembered by your own defense .
what , wake up , man !
propn would have killed you , but you killed propn .
there you are lucky too .
the law that threatened you with death becomes your friend and turns it into exile .
there you are lucky .
pay attention , pay attention , for such people die miserable .
go , go to your love , as was decreed , propn to her chamber there , and comfort her .
but , be careful that you do n ’ t stay after the guards are in place , because then , you can not get to propn , where you shall live until we can find a time to publicize your marriage , reconcile your friends , propn pardon of the prince , and call you back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than you left here in grief .
go before , nurse .
commend me to thy lady ; and bid her to hurry the whole house to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them more likely to do .
propn is coming .
o propn , i could have stayed here all the night to hear good counsel .
o , what a great thing learning is !
my lord , i 'll tell my lady you will come .
do so , and bid my sweet to prepare to scold me .
here , sir , is a ring she asked me give you , sir .
hurry up , make haste , for it grows very late .
how well my comfort is revived by this !
travel to propn .
i 'll contact your man , and he shall bring , from time to time , propn to you of every good event that happens here .
give me your hand .
it ’ s late .
only that a joy beyond joy calls out to me , it ’ s a grief so brief to part with you .
propn .
things have fallen out , sir , so unluckily that we have had no time to talk to our daughter .
listen , she loved her cousin propn dearly , and so did i .
well , we were born to die .
i promise you , except for your company , i would have been in bed an hour ago .
these times of sorrow do n ’ t really give me a chance to pursue love .
propn , good night .
commend me to your daughter .
i will , and i ’ ll know her mind early tomorrow ; tonight she 's shut up with her grief .
propn propn , i will make a desperate offer of my child 's love .
i think she will be ruled by me in all respects , no more , i do n ’ t doubt it .
what day is this ?
propn , my lord .
propn !
ha , ha !
well , propn is too soon , make it propn .
on propn , tell her , she shall be married to this noble earl .
will you be ready ?
do you like this speed ?
we 'll make it a small wedding , a friend or two ; because , listen , propn ’ s being killed so recently , people may think we did n ’ t care for him , being our relative , if we party too much .
so , we 'll have some half a dozen friends , and that ’ ll be it .
but what do say you to propn ?
my lord , i wish that propn were tomorrow .
well , go home .
on propn , it ’ ll be then .
i swear that it is so very , very late that we should call it early by and by .
good night .
are you going ?
it ’ s not morning yet .
believe me , love , it was the nightingale .
it was the lark , the messenger that says it ’ s morning , no nightingale .
look , love , what jealous streaks of sunlight propn the parting clouds over there in the east .
propn 's candles are burned out , and the joyful day propn tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
i have to go and live , or stay and die .
that light is not daylight , i just know it .
it is some meteor that the sun spits out to be a torch - bearer for you tonight and light your way to propn .
therefore stay a bit longer , you do n ’ t need to go .
i 'll say that that gray streak is not the morning sun , it ’ s only the pale reflection of propn 's brow ; and that ’ s not the lark whose notes hit the high ceiling of propn so high above our heads .
i have more care to stay than will to go .
come , death , and welcome !
juliet wills it so .
how is it , my soul ?
it is , it is !
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , straining to sing horrible songs and unpleasing notes .
some say the lark makes sweet division in its songs ; this is n ’ t true , because she divides us .
lighter and lighter , darker and darker our sorrows !
propn !
nurse ?
your lady mother is coming to your bedroom .
then , window , let day in , and let life out .
propn , farewell !
just give me one more kiss , and i 'll climb down .
i must hear from you every hour of the day , because there are many days in just one minute .
o , by this count i ’ ll be very old before i see my propn again !
farewell !
i wo n ’ t miss a chance to send you my greetings , love .
o , do you think we shall ever meet again ?
i do n ’ t doubt it , and all these sorrows shall become sweet memories that we can talk about in our future .
i think i see you , now you are below me , looking like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .
either my eyesight fails , or you look pale .
and trust me , love , in my eyes , so do you .
thirsty sorrow drinks our blood .
o propn propn !
all men say you are changeable .
if you are so fickle , what do you want with a guy who is known for his faith ?
be changeable , propn , because then , i hope , you wo n ’ t keep him long , but send him back to me .
hey , daughter !
are you up ?
who ’ s calling me ?
is it my lady mother ?
is n ’ t she down so late , or up so early ?
what unusual reason brings her here ?
why , how are you , juliet ?
propn , i am not well .
endless weeping for your cousin 's death ?
what , will you wash him from his grave with tears ?
and if you could , you could n ’ t bring him back to life .
therefore , stop grieving .
a little grief shows much love ; but too much of grief shows a little craziness .
let me weep for feeling such a loss .
you ’ ll feel the loss , but not the loss of the friend you weep for .
feeling the loss so much , i ca n ’ t help but weep for the friend forever .
well , girl , you are weeping not so much for his death as for the villain who lives who slaughtered him .
what villain , madam ?
that same villain propn .
the words “ propn ” and his name are many miles apart .
propn pardon him !
i pardon him , with all my heart ; and yet no man like him makes my heart so sad .
that is because the traitor murderer lives .
yes , madam , from the reach of my hands .
i wish that no one but me might avenge my cousin 's death !
we will have vengeance for it , do n ’ t worry about that .
so stop crying .
i 'll send a messenger to someone in propn , where that same banished runaway lives , and he shall give him such an unusual vial of medicine that he will soon keep propn company , and then i hope you ’ ll be satisfied .
indeed i ’ ll never be satisfied with propn till i see him dead .
my poor heart is so aggravated for a kinsman , propn , that if you could only find a man to bear a poison , i would help to mix it , so that propn should , when he gets it , soon sleep in quiet .
o , how my heart hates to hear his name , and i ca n ’ t present myself to him , to vent the love i had for my cousin propn upon the body of the man that has slaughtered him !
you find the means , and i 'll find such a man .
but now i have joyful new for you , girl .
and joy is welcomed in such a needy time .
what is it , i beg your ladyship ?
well , well , you have a careful father , child ; one who , to put you past all this grief , has sorted out a surprise happy day that you had n ’ t expected , and i had n ’ t looked for .
by propn , my child , early next propn morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman , the propn propn , at propn propn 's propn , shall happily make you there a joyful bride .
this is news indeed !
here comes your father .
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it from you .
when the sun sets , the air drizzles dew , but for the funeral of my brother 's son it pours rain .
what ’ s going on ?
still a fountain , girl ?
what , still in tears ?
forever showering ?
what ’ s going on , wife !
have you told her what we have decided for her ?
i wish the foolish girl were married to her grave !
what !
catch me , catch me , wife .
is n ’ t she proud ?
does n ’ t she count her blessings that propn as she is , we have secured so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom ?
i ’ m not proud that you have , but i ’ m thankful that you have .
i can never be proud of what i hate , but i can be thankful even for hate that is meant to be love .
so that ’ s how it is now , arguing with choppy reasoning ?
what is this ?
get out , you green , diseased dead meat !
out , you bag of garbage !
you pale , ugly face !
for shame , for shame !
what , are you crazy ?
i ’ ll see you hang first , young filth !
disobedient wretch !
get yourself to church on propn , or never , after that , look me in the face .
do n ’ t speak , do n ’ t reply , do n ’ t answer me .
my fingers itch .
wife , we were just thinking ourselves blessed that propn had given us this only child , but now i see that this one is one too many , and that we are cursed in having her .
throw her out , the good for nothing !
propn in propn bless her !
you are to blame , my lord , to berate her like this .
and why are you butting in , my lady wisdom ?
i ’ m not telling a lie .
ca n ’ t someone speak ?
peace , you mumbling fool !
talk about your serious speech over a gossip 's bowl , because we do n ’ t need it here ! .
you are too hot under the collar .
propn 's bread !
it makes me angry .
eat where you can , you wo n ’ t live with me .
if you are mine , i 'll give you to my friend ; if you are n ’ t , go hang yourself , beg , starve , die in the streets , because , by my soul , i 'll never acknowledge you exist , and you will cut off from your inheritance .
trust to it .
think about it .
you wo n ’ t make a liar out of me .
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief ?
o , sweet my mother , do n ’ t push me away !
delay this marriage for a month , a week ; or , if you do n ’ t , make my bridal bed in that dim tomb where propn lies .
do n ’ t talk to me , because i wo n ’ t answer you .
do what you want to do , because i ’ m finished with you .
my husband is on earth , my faith in propn .
how can i avoid committing a sin , unless the husband that propn sent me propn ?
what a pity , what a pity that propn should practice its strategies on a weak subject such as i am !
what do you say ?
do n ’ t you have any word of joy ?
give me some comfort , nurse .
well then , here it is .
propn is banished , and all the world is nothing if he ever dares to come back to fight for you .
then , since that ’ s the story as it stands now , i think it best for you to marry the count .
o , he 's a lovely gentleman !
propn 's a dish cloth compared to him .
an eagle , madam , is not as green , as quick , and has n ’ t so beautiful an eye as propn has .
curse my very heart , i think you will be happy in this second marriage , for it surpasses your first .
do you say this from heart ?
and from my soul too or else curse them both .
amen !
what ?
well , you have really comforted me a lot .
go inside , and tell my mother that i ’ m going to propn ' cell to make confession and be forgiven because i ’ ve made my father so angry .
by propn , i will .
damn , damn !
o most wicked , evil woman !
is it more sin to wish me to be a liar , or to curse my husband with the same tongue that she has praised him with , above compare so many thousand times ?
i 'll go to the friar to know his solution .
if there is n ’ t a solution , i have the power to kill myself .
on propn , sir ?
that ’ s very soon .
my father propn wants it that way ; and i wo n ’ t do anything to stop him from being so hasty .
you say you do n ’ t know what the lady thinks about this .
that ’ s not good ; i do n ’ t like it .
she weeps excessively about propn 's death , and because of that , i have n ’ t talked a lot about love , because the goddess of love does n ’ t smile in a house of tears .
now , sir , her father thinks it ’ s dangerous that she gives in so much to her grief ; and , in his wisdom , hurries our marriage to stop the flood of her tears , which , if she does too much crying by herself , may make her too depressed to function in society .
now you know why we ’ re in a hurry .
i wish i knew a reason this wedding should be slowed down .
look , sir , here the lady is coming toward my cell .
i ’ m happy to see you , my lady and my wife !
you may call me that , sir , when i may be a wife .
that “ may be ” must be , love , on next propn .
have you come to make confession to this father ?
to answer that question , i should confess to you .
do n ’ t deny to him that you love me .
i will confess to you that i love him .
so will you confess , i am sure , that you love me .
if i do so , it will be more valuable , being spoken behind your back than to your face .
poor soul , your face is very wet with tears .
the tears have gotten a small victory by that , my face was bad enough before my tears took their revenge .
you insult your face more than the tears did with that comment .
and what i spoke , i spoke to my face .
your face is mine , and you ’ ve lied about it .
what you say may be true , because my face is not mine .
are you busy now , holy father , or shall i come to you at evening mass ?
i ’ m not busy now , nervous daughter .
my lord , we must be alone now .
propn forbid that i should interrupt religion !
juliet , i ’ ll wake you up early on propn early .
until then , goodbye , and keep this holy kiss .
o , shut the door !
i hear that you must , and nothing can prevent it , be married to this count on next propn .
do n ’ t tell me , friar , that you heard about this , unless you can tell me how i can prevent it .
if , in your wisdom , you ca n ’ t help me , only say that my solution is a wise one , and right now , with this knife , i 'll help solve it .
therefore , from your many years of experience in these matters , give me some advice now , or , look , between my will to go the limit and me , this bloody knife shall play the umpire , deciding the problem that your many years ’ experience could bring to an honorable resolution .
do n ’ t take long to speak .
i want to die , if what you ’ re going to say is not a solution to this problem .
stop , daughter .
i do see a kind of hope , which requires a plan as desperate as that event we want to prevent .
if , rather than to marry propn propn you have the strength of will to kill yourself , then is it likely you will try something like death to chase this shame away , something that will cover you with death himself , to escape from it ?
stay , then .
go home , be merry , and agree to marry propn .
tomorrow is propn .
now , when the bridegroom comes in the morning to wake up from your bed , there you are , dead .
and he and i will watch you wake up , and that very night propn take you there , to propn .
give it to me !
o , do n ’ t tell me about fear !
stop it .
i 'll send a friar to propn propn , with my letters to propn .
love give me strength !
and strength shall gives us help .
propn , dear father .
invite the many guests on this list .
servant , go hire me twenty great cooks .
no one will get food poisoning , sir ; i 'll watch to see if they lick their fingers .
how can watch them ?
by propn , sir , it ’ s a sick cook that can not lick his own fingers .
therefore , he that can not lick his fingers wo n ’ t come back with me .
go , get going .
we will not have enough food and drink for this feast .
what , did my daughter go to propn propn ?
yes , she really did .
well , maybe he ’ ll do her some good .
a spiteful , self - willed , badly behaved child , she is .
see how she comes from confession with a happy face .
hello , my headstrong daughter !
where have you been wandering ?
where i have learned how to repent the sin of my stubbornness and disobedience to you and your requests ; and i am commanded by holy propn to fall flat on the floor here , to beg your forgiveness .
forgive me , i beg you !
from this point forward , i will always obey you .
send for the propn .
go tell him about this .
i 'll have this marriage done tomorrow morning .
i met the youthful lord at propn ' cell ; and gave him what proper love i might , not overstepping the bounds of modesty .
why , i am glad !
this is great .
stand up .
this is as it should be .
let me see the propn .
yes , by propn , go , i tell you , and have him come here .
now , before propn , everyone in our whole city is much bound to this reverend holy friar .
nurse , will you go with me to my closet , and help me pick out the things you think i will need for tomorrow ?
no , not until propn .
there ’ s plenty of time .
go , nurse , go with her .
we 're going to church tomorrow .
we are not going to have enough food .
it ’ s almost night now .
i will work it out , and everything will be fine , i guarantee you , wife .
you go to propn , help her ready .
what , hey !
well , i will walk myself over to propn propn house , to prepare him for tomorrow .
my heart is wonderfully light since this same wayward girl is so reformed .
what , are you busy , hello ?
do you need my help ?
no , madam ; we have selected the necessary things that are useful for our event tomorrow .
so please , leave me alone now , and let the nurse sit up with you this night ; for i am sure you have your hands full in this so sudden business .
good night .
go to bed and rest , because you need to rest .
farewell !
propn knows when we shall meet again .
i have a faint , cold fear that scares my veins and it almost freezes up the heat of life .
i 'll call them back again to comfort me ; nurse !
what is she going to do here ?
i must act my dreadful scene alone .
come , vial .
what if this mixture does n ’ t work at all ?
shall i be married , then , tomorrow morning ?
no , no !
this dagger shall forbid it .
you lie there .
what if it be a poison , which the friar has secretly given me to have me dead , so that he should n ’ t be dishonored because he married me to propn before propn ?
i wo n ’ t entertain such a bad thought .
what if , when i am laid in the tomb , i wake up before the time that propn is supposed to come and get me ?
that ’ s a scary thought !
the , should n ’ t i smother in the vault , where there is no fresh air , and i will die there , strangled , before my propn comes ?
o , look !
i think i see my cousin 's ghost looking for propn who pierced his body with a sword 's point .
wait , propn , wait !
propn , i ’ m coming !
i drink this vial to you .
hold on , take these keys and go get more spices , nurse .
they ’ re asking for dates and quinces in the pastry .
come on , let ’ s get going !
the second rooster has crowed , the curfew bell has rung , it ’ s three o'clock .
do n ’ t worry about the cost .
in faith , you 'll be sick tomorrow because you stayed up all night , supervising .
no , not a whit .
yeah , you have been a real weasel in your time , but i will watch you to keep you from staying up all night now .
a jealous spy , a jealous spy !
now , fellow , what 's there ?
things for the cook , sir ; but i do n ’ t know what .
hurry up , hurry up ! .
servant , go get drier logs .
propn propn , he ’ ll show you where they are .
i have a head , sir , that will find out where the logs are , i do n ’ t have to bother propn .
by the propn , well said ; a merry bastard , ha !
you shall be a “ logger - head . ” good faith , it ’ s morning .
the propn will be here soon with music , because he said he would .
i hear him nearby .
nurse !
wife !
what , hello !
what , nurse , i say !
i 'll go and chat with propn .
quickly , hurry , propn .
propn !
what , mistress !
juliet !
fast asleep , i guarantee her .
why , lamb !
why , lady !
for shame , you lazy loafer !
why , love , i say !
propn !
sweetheart !
why , propn !
what , not a word ?
you get your money ’ s worth of sleep now .
sleep for a week , because tonight , i guarantee , propn propn has set up his rest so that you shall rest but little .
propn forgive me !
i must wake her up .
propn , madam , madam !
yes , let the count get you out of your bed .
what , you ’ re dressed !
i must wake you up .
propn !
propn !
propn !
for pity ’ s sake , for pity ’ s sake !
help , help !
my lady 's dead !
o , pitiful day that i was ever born !
some whiskey , hello !
my lord !
my lady !
what noise is here ?
o lamentable day !
what ’ s the matter ?
look , look !
o heavy day !
o me , o me !
my child , my only life !
wake up , look up , or i will die with you !
help , help !
call help .
for shame , bring propn out ; her lord is here .
she 's dead , deceased !
she 's dead , pitiful day !
pitiful day , she 's dead , she 's dead , she 's dead !
ha !
let me see her .
for mercy ’ s sake !
death lies on her like an untimely frost on the sweetest flower in all the fields .
o lamentable day !
o sorrowful time !
death , that has taken her away to make me wail , ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
ready to go , but never to return .
o son , the night before your wedding day death has slept with your bride .
she lies there , like the flower that she was , her virginity taken by him .
i will die and leave him my entire estate .
life , living — death has it all .
i have long thought i would see this morning 's face , and does it give me such a sight as this ?
cursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
most miserable hour that time ever saw in lasting work of his travels !
but one , poor one , one poor and loving child , but one thing to rejoice and take comfort in , and cruel death has taken it from my sight !
o woe !
o woeful , woeful , woeful day !
most lamentable day , most woeful day that ever , ever , i have seen !
o day !
o day !
o day !
o hateful day !
a day as black as this has never been seen !
o woeful day !
o woeful day !
deceived , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !
o love !
o life !
not life , but love in death !
despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
uncomfortable time , why do you come now to murder , murder our solemnity ?
o child !
o child !
my soul , and not my child !
dead you are , dead !
for pity , my child is dead ; and , with my child , my joys are buried !
peace , ho , for shame !
confusion 's cure does n ’ t live in these confusions .
your part in her you could not keep from death , but propn keeps his part in eternal life .
o , in this kind of love , you love your child so badly that you are going crazy , seeing that she is well .
dry up your tears , and stick your rosemary on this fair corpse ; and , as the custom is , in all her best array , carry her to church , because , although foolish nature bids us all to grieve , still nature 's tears are sanity 's happiness .
propn , you go inside , and , madam , go with him ; and go , propn propn .
every one should prepare to follow this beautiful corpse to her grave .
in faith , we may put up our pipes and go home .
yeah , by my truth , the case may be amended .
we ’ re not playing a merry tune .
this is no time to play .
you wo n ’ t play then ?
no .
then , i ’ ll give it to you as payment .
what will you give us ?
then will i give you the serving - creature .
then i will lay the serving - creature 's dagger on your head .
i wo n ’ t any hooked instruments .
i 'll “ re ” you , i 'll “ fa ” you .
do you note me ?
if you “ re ” us and “ fa ” us , you note us .
please put away your dagger , and pull out your wit .
then , i ’ ll attack you with my wit !
i will beat you severely with an iron wit , and put away my iron dagger .
answer me like men .
by propn , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .
pretty !
what do you say , propn propn ?
i say “ silver sound ” because musicians makes sounds for silver .
pretty too !
what do you say , propn propn ?
faith , i do n ’ t know what to say .
o , have mercy !
you are the singer .
i will say it for you .
it is “ music with her silver sound ” because musicians have no gold for making sounds .
then music with her silver sound ” with speedy help gives relief from sorrow . ” what kind of an annoying knave is this guy ? !
the hell with him , propn !
come , we 'll go in here , wait for the mourners , and stay for dinner .
if i may trust what happens while i sleep , my dreams predict some joyful news is coming .
my heart is very light in my chest , and all this day an unusually happy spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts .
i dreamed that my lady came and found me dead , strange dream , that gives a dead man a second thought !
and she breathed such life with her kisses on my lips , that i was brought back to life , and i was an emperor .
ah me !
how sweet love is when it is yours , when only love 's shadows are so rich in joy !
news from propn !
how are you , propn ?
do n ’ t you bring me letters from the friar ?
how is my lady doing ?
is my father well ?
how fares my propn ?
i ’ ll ask that again ; for nothing can be wrong if she is well .
then she is well , and nothing can be wrong .
her body sleeps in the propn tomb , and her soul lives with the angels .
i saw her burial in her relative 's vault , and the i rushed to tell you .
o , forgive me for bringing you this sad news , since you did leave it all up to me , sir .
is it so ?
then , i defy you , stars !
you know where i live .
get me ink and paper , and hire some horses .
i will leave here tonight .
i beg you , sir , have patience .
you look pale and wild , and these signs some bad luck .
you ’ re mistaken .
leave me , and do as i ask you .
do n ’ t you letters to me from the friar ?
no , my good lord .
no matter .
get going , and hire those horses .
i 'll be with you right away .
well , propn , i ’ ll sleep with you tonight .
let 's figure out how to do this .
o mischief , you are quick to enter into the thoughts of desperate men !
i do remember a pharmacist , and lives near here , who i noticed was dressed in in tattered weeds , with overwhelming eyebrows , choosing the simple life .
he looked very thin , as if sharp misery had worn him down to the bones ; and in his poor shop a turtle was hanging , and a stuffed alligator , and other skins of ill - shaped fishes , and on his shelves he had a poverty - stricken collection of empty boxes , and green earthen pots , animal bladders , and musty smelling seeds , propn of leftover twine , and old cakes of roses , were thinly scattered around , to make up a display .
noting this poverty , i said to myself , ” if a man did need a poison now , ” the sale of which is punished by death in propn , ” here lives a poor wretch would sell it to him . ” o , this same thought only predicted my need , and this same needy man must sell it to me .
as i remember , this should be the house .
being a holiday , the beggar 's shop is closed .
what , hello !
pharmacist !
who is calling so loudly ?
come here , man .
let me have a small vial of poison , such quickly acting medicine that it will disperse itself throughout all the veins in order that the life - weary taker may fall dead , and that the body may suffocate as violently as speedy gunpowder hurries a bullet from a gun barrel .
i have such deadly drugs , but propn 's law gives the death penalty to anybody who sells them .
you are so naked and full of misery and you ’ re afraid to die ?
my poverty agrees to take it , but not my will .
i pay your poverty , and not your will .
put this poison into any liquid you want , and drink it all ; and , if you had the strength of twenty men , it would kill you right away .
i sell you poison ; you have n ’ t sold me any .
propn .
buy food and put on some weight .
holy franciscan friar !
this is the voice of propn propn .
welcome from propn .
what does propn say ?
or , if he wrote his mind , give me his letter .
going to find a fellow brother , one of our order , to help me visit the sick here in this city , and finding him , the searchers of the town , suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious plague was , sealed up the doors , and would n ’ t let us leave ; so that my speed to propn was delayed by that .
the , who took my letter to propn ?
i could n ’ t deliver it , so here it is again , i could n ’ t even get a messenger to bring it back to you , they were so afraid of getting infected with the plague .
very bad luck !
by my brotherhood , the letter was not a social one , but a message of great importance , and failing to deliver it may do a lot of damage .
brother , i 'll go and bring it to you .
she will really curse me that propn has had no news of these events ; but i will write to him again in propn , and keep her at my cell until propn comes to get her ; poor living corpse , closed in a dead man 's tomb !
give me your torch , boy .
go away , and stand over there .
then whistle to me as signal that you hear something approaching .
give me those flowers .
go , do what i have told you .
i am almost afraid to stand alone here in the churchyard , but i will stay .
i will keep saying the funeral prayers for you , and i will come every night to put flowers on your grave and weep .
the boy gives the warning something is approaching .
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight , to disturb my funeral prayers and the rites of true love ?
what , with a torch !
night , hide me awhile .
give me that chisel - edged pick and the iron wrench .
stop , take this letter .
first thing in the morning , see that you deliver it to my lord and father .
why i ’ m going down into this tomb is partly to see my lady 's face , but mostly to take a precious ring from her dead finger , a ring that i must use in a very special errand .
but if you return , jealous , and try to find out what i intend to do , by propn , i will tear you limb from limb , and scatter your limbs all over this hungry churchyard !
the time and my intents are savage and wild , so much ore fierce and more determined than hungry tigers or the roaring sea .
i ’ ll go , sir , and not trouble you .
this way you show me friendship .
you take that .
live , and be prosperous , and , farewell , good fellow .
just the same , i 'll hide close by .
i fear his looks , and i doubt his reasons .
you hateful belly , you womb of death , propn full with the dearest morsel of the earth , i will force your rotten jaws to open , and , in spite , i 'll cram you fuller with more food !
this man is that banished , arrogant propn that murdered my love 's cousin , by which grief , it is supposed , the beautiful creature died , and he ’ s come here to desecrate the dead bodies .
i will seize him .
stop your unholy work , vile propn !
can vengeance be pursued any further than death ?
condemned villain , i arrest you .
obey , and go with me , because you must die .
i beg you , youth , do n ’ t put another sin on my head by urging me to fight .
o , go away !
by propn , i love you better than i love myself , because i came here only armed against myself .
live , and later you will say , a madman 's mercy made you run away .
i defy your solemn appeal , and i here arrest you as a felon .
will you still provoke me ?
then , i ’ ll get you , boy !
o lord , they ’ re fighting !
i ’ ll go call the guards .
o , i ’ m killed !
if you are merciful , open the tomb , lay me with propn .
in faith , i will .
let me see this face .
propn 's relative , noble propn propn !
what my man say , when my soul was tossing and turning and i did n ’ t pay attention to him as we rode ?
i think he told me propn was going to marry propn .
did he say it ?
or did i dream it ?
or i ’ m crazy to think it was so , hearing him talk of propn ?
o , give me your hand , one written along with me in sour luck 's book !
o , no , a lantern , slaughtered youth , because propn lies here , and her beauty makes this tomb a party room full of light .
death , you lie there , buried by a dead man .
how often , when men are at the point of death have they been happy ? !
which their keepers call a lightening before death .
o , how may i call this a lightening ?
o my love !
my wife !
death , that has sucked the honey of your breath , has had no power yet on your beauty .
you ’ re not conquered .
propn 's officer is still red on your lips and in your cheeks , and death 's pale flag is not yet planted there .
propn , do you lie there in your bloody sheet ?
o , what other favor can i do for you than to end the youth of your enemy with the same hand that cut your youth half ?
forgive me , cousin !
ah , dear propn , why are you still so beautiful ?
shall i believe that death that has no substance is a lover , and that the lean ugly monster keeps you here in dark to be his mistress ?
because i ’ m afraid of that , i still will stay with you , and never leave this palace of dim night again .
here , here i will remain with the worms that are your maids .
o , here i will set up my everlasting rest , and shake off the bonds of unlucky stars from my world - wearied body .
eyes , look your last !
arms , take your last embrace !
and , lips , o you the doors of breath , seal a timeless bargain with death , who will take everything , with a righteous kiss !
you desperate sea captain , now run your sea - sick weary ship onto the dashing rocks all at once !
here 's to my love !
drinks .
your drugs are quick .
so , i die with a kiss .
propn propn be my speed !
how often tonight have my old feet stumbled over graves !
who 's there ?
it ’ s me , a friend , and one that knows you well .
blessings on you !
tell me , good my friend , what torch is over there that wastes giving his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
as far as i can see , it burns in the propn ’ s tomb .
it does , holy sir ; and my master is in there , one that you love .
who is it ?
propn .
how long has he been in there ?
a full half hour .
go with me to the tomb .
stay then ; i 'll go alone .
fear comes over me .
o , i ’ m very much afraid that some evil , unlucky thing has happened .
as i was sleeping under this yew tree here , i dreamed that my master and another fought , and that my master killed him .
propn !
what do these master - less and gory swords mean by lying here with blood on them in this place of peace ?
propn !
o , you ’ re pale !
who else ?
what , propn too ?
and you ’ re covered in blood ?
ah , what an unlucky hour is guilty of this lamentable event !
the lady is waking up .
o comfortable friar !
where is my lord ?
i remember well where i should be , and here i am .
where is my propn ?
i hear some noise .
a greater power than we can contradict has opposed our plans .
come , come away !
your husband in your bosom lies dead there , and propn too .
come , i 'll hide you among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
do n ’ t stay to question what happened , because the guard is coming .
come , go , good propn .
i do n ’ t dare to stay longer .
go , get away from here , because i will not leave .
what 's here ?
a cup closed in my true love 's hand ?
poison , i see , has been his timeless end .
o husband !
you drank it all and did n ’ t leave just a friendly drop to help me join you ?
i will kiss your lips .
maybe some poison is still on them , to make me die by restoring me .
your lips are warm !
lead , boy .
which way is it ?
yes , noise ?
then i 'll be brief .
o happy dagger !
go , some of you , whoever you find , arrest .
pitiful sight !
here the propn lies slain , and propn bleeding , warm , and newly dead , who has been buried in this tomb for two days .
we see the ground on which these sorrows lie , but we can not find the true ground of all these piteous woes without knowing what happened .
here 's propn 's man .
we found him in the churchyard .
hold him in safety until the prince arrives .
here is a friar , trembling , sighing , and weeping .
we took this chisel - edged pick and this shovel from him as he was coming from this side of the churchyard .
very suspicious !
hold the friar too .
what unlucky event is up so early , that calls me from my morning 's rest ?
what ’ s the matter that they scream so loudly in the streets ?
the people in the street cry “ propn , ” some “ propn , ” and some “ propn , ” and all run with open outcries toward our tomb .
what noise startles in our ears ?
sovereign , here lies propn propn slain , and propn dead , and propn , who was dead before , no warm and newly killed .
search , seek , and know how this foul murder happened .
here is a friar , and dead propn 's man , with instruments on him that are fit to open these dead men 's tombs .
o heaven !
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
this dagger has been mistaken , for , behold , his empty case is on the back of propn , and it ’ s misplaced in my daughter 's bosom !
o me !
this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a tomb .
come , propn ; because you are up early to see your son and heir taken down even earlier .
for pity ’ s sake , my lord , my wife died tonight .
grief of my son 's exile has killed her .
what additional sorrow conspires against my old age ?
look , and you ’ ll see .
o you stupid boy !
what kind of manners is it to go to a grave before your father ?
and then i will be in charge of your sorrows , and lead you even to death .
in the meantime , do nothing , and let the investigation be do patiently .
bring out the suspects .
i am the greatest , able to do least , yet most suspected , as the time and place propn suspicion on me as guilty of this sad murder ; and here i stand , both to accuse and free myself , condemned and myself excused .
then tell what you know about all of this .
i will be brief , for i do n ’ t have enough breath to this tedious tale .
propn , there dead , was husband to that propn ; and she , there dead , was propn 's faithful wife .
i married them ; and their secret wedding day was propn 's doomsday , whose untimely death banished the new - made bridegroom from this city , for whom propn pined , and not for propn .
you , to remove that siege of grief from her , engaged and would have married her against her will , to propn propn .
then she comes to me , and with wild looks , asks me to devise some means to get her of this second marriage , or right there , in my cell , she would kill herself .
then gave i her , according to my craft with herbs , a sleeping potion ; which took effect as i intended , for it made her propn dead .
in the meantime , i wrote to propn that he should come home , this bad night , to help to take her from her borrowed grave , at the time that the potion would wear off .
but the man who carried my letter , propn propn , was delayed by accident , and last night returned my letter to me .
then all alone at the prearranged hour of her waking up , i came to take her from her relative 's tomb , intending to keep her close at my cell until i could easily send for propn .
but when i got here , some minutes before the time of her waking up , here the noble propn propn and true propn , both untimely dead .
we still know you are a holy man .
where 's propn 's man ?
what can he say about this ?
i brought news of propn 's death to my master , and then he came from propn , by horse , to this same place , to this same tomb .
he asked me to give his father this letter , and threatened me with death , going into the tomb , if i did n ’ t leave , and i left him there .
give me the letter .
i will read it .
where is the propn ’ s page who called the guards ?
propn , what was your master doing in this place ?
he came to scatter flowers on his lady 's grave , and asked me to stand off to the side , and so i did .
then here comes one with light to open the tomb , and , by - and - by , my master drew his sword on him ; and then i ran away to call the guards .
where are these enemies ?
propn , propn , see what a cruel calamity is caused your hate , that propn finds a way to kill your joys with love !
and i , for disregarding your feud too , have lost a number of relatives .
we are all are punished .
o brother propn , give me your hand .
this is my daughter 's dowry , for i can command no more .
propn 's shall be as rich , lying by his lady 's side , poor sacrifices of our hatred !
this morning brings a gloomy peace with it .
the sun will not show his head for sorrow .
good !
let ’ s go , my good men !
look lively , look lively , my good men !
quick , quick !
take in the top sail .
listen to the propn 's whistle .
to the storm ] blow your wind until you burst , so long as there ’ s room enough for us .
where 's the captain ?
keep the men moving .
please now , keep below .
where is the captain , officer in charge ?
do n ’ t you hear him ?
no , good man , be patient .
i ’ ll be patient when the sea is patient .
get going !
what do these noisy storms care about the name of king ?
do n ’ t bother us .
good man , even now , remember whom you have aboard .
no one that i love more than myself .
you are a council member : if you can command these elements to be silent , and make this present storm more peaceful , we wo n ’ t need to work the ropes anymore .
i get great comfort from this fellow .
i do n ’ t think he has been marked for drowning : his complexion is perfect for being hanged .
hold your position , good propn , for his hanging !
make the rope of his hanging our rope for the anchor , because the one we have now does us little good !
if he is not born to be hanged , then our present state is pitiful .
down with the top mast !
quick !
lower , lower !
a cry inside ] propn their screaming !
what are you doing here ?
shall we give up and drown ?
do you intend to sink us ?
propn your voice , you loud , cursing , selfish dog !
then go to work .
hang , dog , hang !
propn , arrogant noisemaker , we ’ re less afraid to be drowned than you are .
i 'll wager against his drowning , even if the ship was no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unsatisfied mistress .
we ’ re all lost !
say your prayers ; say your prayers !
we ’ re all lost !
what , must our voices be ignored ?
the propn and propn are saying prayers !
let ’ s join them , since our predicament is the same as theirs .
i am out of patience .
he 'll still be hanged , although every drop of water swears against it and open very wide to fill him up .
mercy on us ! ” — “ we ’ re breaking up , we ’ re breaking up ! ” — ” goodbye , my wife and children ! ” — “ propn , propn breaking up , we ’ re breaking up , we ’ re breaking up ! ” — let 's all sink with the propn .
let 's tell him goodbye .
right now , i would give a 220,000 yards of sea for an acre of bare ground ; a long wasteland , brown brush , anything .
if , my dearest father , you have put the wild waters into this fury by your magic , stop them .
it seems that the sky would pour down stinking , boiling tar , except that the sea , mounting to the cloud ’ s cheek , puts the fire out .
poor souls , they perished .
if i had been any god of power , i would have sunk the sea on the earth , before it would have swallowed the good ship and the souls that were her cargo .
no harm done .
i have done nothing except to protect you , protect you , my dear one , you , my daughter , who does n ’ t know what you are , not knowing where i come from or that i better than propn , master of a full , poor dwelling , and your not so proud father .
it never entered my mind to know more .
it is time i should tell you more .
give me your hand , and take my magic cloak from me .— so : lie there my magic .— wipe your eyes ; have comfort .
the sad spectacle of the wreck , which touched the very virtue of compassion in you , i have ordered so safely with similar use of my magic that there is no soul— no , not so much damage as to one hair happened to any creature on the vessel which you heard cry , which you saw sink .
sit down ; because you must now know more .
you have often started to tell me who i am , but you stopped , and left me to a useless questioning , concluding “ wait , not yet . ” now it ’ s time , the very minute asks you to listen carefully ; obey and listen .
can you remember a time before we came to this dwelling ?
i do n ’ t think you can , because then you were n ’ t three years old yet .
certainly , sir , i can .
how ?
it is faded , and rather like a dream than a definite memory in my mind .
did n ’ t i once have four , or five , women once , that took care of me ?
you did , and more , propn .
but how is it that this memory lives in your mind ?
what else do you see in the old , dark , bottomless pit of time ?
if you remember anything before you came here , how you came here , you may remember .
but i do n ’ t remember coming here .
your mother was a piece of virtue , and she said you were my daughter : and your father was propn of propn and his only heir a princess — born no less .
o , the heavens !
what foul play did we have that we left there ?
or was it a blessing that we did ?
both , both , my girl .
by foul play , as you say , we were lifted from there , but blessedly helped here .
please , go on .
my brother and your uncle , called propn please , listen to me , — that a brother should be so guilty of breaking a propn , whom i loved in all the world , after you , and i let him manage of my city , since , at that time , it was the first of all the cities , and propn the best duke , being considered so in dignity , and for the liberal arts , without equal : since these two items took up all my time in study , i cast the government on my brother , and i became a stranger to my city , being absorbed and wrapped up in my secret studies .
your false uncle— are you listening to me ?
propn , very carefully .
oh , good sir , i am !
please , listen to me .
my neglecting worldly responsibilities like that , dedicating everything to seclusion and the bettering of my mind with that which , only by being so secluded , was worth more than all popular opinion , awoke in my false brother an evil nature ; and my trust , like a good parent , made him lie , a lie as great as my trust was , which had no limit indeed , a confidence without boundaries .
playing the lord like that , not only with what my money yielded , but also whatever else my power might get him , — like one who having lied so often by telling it enough , made his memory such a sinner that it gave propn to his own lie , — he believed he was indeed the propn , making substitution for me , and wearing the outward show of royalty , with all rights and privileges .— here his ambition growing— are you listening ?
your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
to have no separation between this part he played and the man he played it for , he had to become the propn propn of propn .
for me , poor man — my library was dukedom large enough : now he believes that i am incapable of performing my political duties ; he makes an alliance , — he was so hungry for power , — with the propn of propn to give propn annual protection money , pledge allegiance , surrender his small crown to propn crown , and bend the dukedom , which had never bowed before — alas , poor milan ! — to most dishonorable bowing .
oh , the heavens !
listen to the situation and the event ; then tell me if this might be a brother .
i should sin only to think nobly of my grandmother : good women have had bad sons .
now the situation .
this propn of propn , being an old enemy of mine , listens my brother 's request , which was , that he , instead of the promises of allegiance and i do n ’ t know how much protection money , should presently drive me and my family out of the dukedom , and give the fair city of propn , with all the honors to my brother : which , with a treacherous army recruited , on a midnight assigned to the purpose , propn opened the gates of propn ; and , in the dead of darkness , the ones given the job hurried me and your crying self from there .
a pity that it should be so !
i , not remembering how i cried out then , will cry it out all over again : it is a moment that makes my eyes cry .
listen a little bit more , and then i 'll bring you to the present situation which is now here , without which , this story would be most irrelevant .
why did n ’ t they destroy us then and there ?
good question , girl : my tale invites that question .
there they launched us , to cry to the sea that roared at us , to sigh to the winds , whose pity , sighing back again , only did us loving wrong .
what trouble i was to you then !
oh , you were an angel that saved me !
you smiled , instilled with strength from propn , when i have covered the sea with salty tears , groaning under my load , which raised in me a new strength , to put with whatever should follow .
how did we come ashore ?
by propn propn .
we had some food and some fresh water that a noble propn , propn , — who , being then appointed propn of this plot , — gave us out of his goodness , with propn garments , linens , stuffs , and other necessities , which have since been very useful : so , of his gentleness , knowing how i loved my books , he supplied me , with volumes from my own library that i prize more than my dukedom .
i wish i might only see that man again !
we arrived here on this island : and here i , your schoolmaster , have made you grow more than other princes can , who have more time for worthless hours , and tutors that are not as careful .
heavens thank you for it !
and now , please , sir , — because it is still on my mind , — your reason for raising this storm at sea ?
know this much .
now , my dear lady , by most strange accident , propn propn , has brought my enemies to this shore ; and by my knowledge of things to come , i find my highest point depends on a very lucky star , that , if i do n ’ t seek its influence now and overlook it , my fortunes will sink forever after .
i am ready now .
approach , my propn ; come !
i come to answer your best requests ; is it to fly , to swim , to dive into the fire , to ride on the curled clouds ; give propn and all his quality your strong requests .
in every detail .
my brave spirit !
who is so firm , so constant , that this noisy disturbance would not infect his sanity ?
there was n ’ t a soul that only felt a fever of the madness and played some tricks out of desperation .
all except the sailors propn in the foaming ocean and abandoned ship , then i was all on fire : the propn 's son , propn , with hair standing up straight —then like reeds , not hair— was the first man that jumped , crying “ propn is empty , and all the devils are here . ” why , that 's my spirit !
but was n ’ t this near the shore ?
close by , my master .
but are they safe , propn ?
not even a hair died ; not a spot on their clothing , but fresher than they were before , and , as you ordered me , i have dispersed them in groups around the island .
i have brought the king 's son ashore by himself , and i left him cooling off with the air that blows gently in a remote spot of the island , and sitting , his arms sadly folded like this .
tell me how you have disposed of the propn 's ship , the sailors , and all the rest of the fleet ?
except that there 's more work .
what time of the day is it ?
past noon .
at least two hours past that .
the time between six and now must be spent most preciously by us both .
is there more work ?
since you give me so much trouble , let me remind you what you have promised , which is not yet done for me .
how is it now !
moody ?
what is it you demand ?
my freedom .
before the debt is paid ?
no more !
please , remember i have worked faithfully for you , told you no lies , made no mistakes , served without a grudge or grumblings .
you promised to give it to me after a full year .
do you forget from what a torment i freed you ?
no .
you do , and you think it ’ s a lot to walk the waves of the ocean , to run on the sharp wind of the north , to do my business under the earth when it is baked with frost .
i do n ’ t , sir .
you lie , malignant thing !
have you forgotten the foul witch propn , who had grown in to a circle with age and envy ?
have you forgotten her ?
no , sir .
you have .
where was she born ?
speak ; tell me .
propn , in propn .
i must recount what you have been once a month , which you forget .
they would not take her life for one thing she did .
is n ’ t this true ?
yes , sir .
this blue - eyed hag was brought here , pregnant , and was left here by sailors .
then this was an island — except for the son that she had here , a freckled pup , born of a witch — not resembling any human shape .
yes , propn , her son .
i say he ’ s a dull thing , that propn , whom now i keep as a servant .
i thank you , master .
if you make any more complaints , i will open an oak and put you inside it until you have howled away twelve more years .
do so ; and after two days , i will set you free .
that 's my noble master !
what shall i do ?
go , change into a spirit , and come here invisibly : go , come here with care !
propn , dear heart , awake !
you have slept well ; propn !
the strangeness of your story made me very sleepy .
shake it off .
come on ; we 'll visit propn my slave , who never gives us a kind answer .
it is a villain , sir , that i do n ’ t like to look at .
but as it is , we ca n ’ t dismiss him : he makes our fire , propn in our wood ; and serves in jobs that are to our advantage .— what hey !
there 's enough wood inside .
when ?
fine apparition !
my lord , it shall is done .
you poisonous slave , fathered by the devil himself through your wicked mother , come out !
let a dew as wicked as any my mother brushed from a polluted bog with raven 's feather fall on both of you !
a south - west wind blow on you , and blister you all over !
i must eat my dinner .
this island 's mine , through propn my mother , which you took from me .
all the charms of propn , toads , beetles , bats , fall on you !
because i am all of the subjects that you have , who was first my own king ; and here you chain me to this hard rock , while you keep from me the rest of the island .
you most lying slave , propn beatings may move , not kindness !
i have used you , propn as you are , with human care , and let you live in my own dwelling , until you tried to rape my daughter .
i wish i had !
you stopped me ; i would have populated this island with propn .
disgusting slave , in which any type of goodness wo n ’ t take hold , being capable of every evil !
offspring of a witch , come here !
get fuel for us and you had better be quick about answering the other business .
so , slave : get going !
come to these yellow sands , and then take my hands : propn courteously when you have and kiss me , — the wild waves are silent , — propn gracefully here and there ; and , sweet spirits , listen to the chorus .
listen , listen !
propn off - stage : bow , wow !
at different times ) ] listen , listen !
is it in the air or the earth ?
it ’ s stopped ; — and surely , it ’ s for some god of the island .
no , it begins again .
sea - spirits ring his death bell every hour : [ propn ( off - stage ) : propn - dong .
the little song reminds me of my drowned father .
this is not an act of man , nor any sound like those on earth : — i hear it now above me .
what is it ?
a spirit ?
propn , how it looks about !
i might call him a divine thing ; because i have never seen anything so natural that was so noble .
aside ] it goes just the way , i see , that my soul wants it .— propn , fine spirit !
i 'll free you within two days for this .
i ’ m not a miracle , sir ; but certainly a virgin .
my language !
what !
the best ?
what would happen to you , if the propn of propn heard you ?
an alone thing , as i am now , that is amazed to hear you speak of propn .
he hears me ; and i weep because he does : i myself am propn , who saw , — and i have n ’ t stopped crying , — saw the propn , my father wrecked .
how sad , for mercy !
yes , believe me , and all his lords , the propn of propn , and his brave son being two of those lost .
aside .
why speaks my father so roughly ?
aside .
oh !
to propn ] one word more : i order you that you wait on me .
here you steal the name you do n ’ t own and have put yourself on this island as a spy , to win it from me , the lord of it .
no , i swear it as a man .
follow me .
no ; i will resist such treatment until my enemy has more power to fight .
what !
do n ’ t hang on my clothes .
propn , have pity ; i 'll be his guarantee .
silence !
one word more shall make me scold you , if not hate you .
hush !
to many men this is a propn , and they are angels to him .
you shall be as free as the mountain winds if you only do exactly every detail of my command .
please , peace .
any comfort he gets is like cold oatmeal .
the visitor wo n ’ t abandon him like that .
sir , — one : speak .
you have taken it more seriously than i meant you to .
therefore , my lord , — propn it , what a waste he makes of his words !
please , spare me .
the old rooster .
the young rooster .
ok . what ’ s the bet ?
a hearty laugh .
it ’ s a bet !
though this island seems to be propn ha , ha , ha !
so , now you 're paid .
unable to be lived on and almost out of reach , — propn propn he could n ’ t resist it .
it has to be of mild , tender , and delicate climate .
climate was a delicate mistress .
yes , and mild , as he has said most knowledgeably .
the air here is very sweet for us .
or , as it were perfumed by a swamp .
true ; except the means to live it .
there 's none , or little of that .
how lush and lusty the grass looks !
how green !
the ground indeed is orangey .
with a touch of green in it .
he does n ’ t miss much .
no ; he only totally misses the truth .
but the special thing about it is , — which is indeed almost beyond belief , — as many verified “ special things ” are .
that our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the ocean , have , nevertheless , retained their freshness and sheen , seeming to be just cleaned rather than stained with salt water .
if only one of his pockets could speak , would n ’ t it say he lies ?
yes , or hide the report in the pocket .
i think our garments are now as fresh as they were when we first put them in propn , at the wedding of the king 's fair daughter , propn , to the propn of propn .
it was a sweet wedding , and we were doing so well on our return .
propn was never graced before with anything equal to their queen .
not since widow propn 's time .
widow !
like hell she was !
how did she become a widow ?
propn propn !
propn propn , ” you said ?
you made me study that one ; she was from propn , not of propn .
this propn , sir , was propn .
carthage ?
trust me , propn .
his word is more miraculous than the magic harp .
he has raised the wall and houses too .
what impossible subject will he make easy next ?
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket , and give it his son as an apple .
and , sowing the seeds of it in the ocean , create more islands .
yes .
why , in good time .
to propn .
propn , we were discussing how our garments now seem as fresh as they were when we were at the wedding of your daughter , who is now propn , in propn .
and the rarest person that ever came there .
stop , please , widow propn .
oh !
propn propn ; yes , widow dido .
is n ’ t my jacket , sir , as fresh as the first day i wore it ?
i mean , in a way .
you cram these words into my ears against the stomach of my sense .
i wish i had never married my daughter there !
because , coming from there , my son is lost ; and , in my opinion , she is too , who is so far away from propn , that i shall never see her again .
no , no ; he 's gone .
propn , you may thank yourself for this great loss , since you would n ’ t bless our propn with your daughter , but would rather marry her to an propn ; where she is , at least , out of your sight , you who has cause to shed tears about it .
please , peace .
you were kneeled to and otherwise begged by all of us ; and the fair soul herself considered at which option she should take , between reluctance and obedience .
so is the most difficult loss .
my lord propn , the truth you speak lacks some gentleness and proper timing ; you rub the wound , when you should bring the propn - propn .
very well .
and almost like a licensed surgeon .
it is bad weather in us all , good sir , when you are cloudy .
very bad .
if i had a plantation of this island , my lord , — listen , plant it with plants that sting .
or the antidote for stinging plants or hollyhocks .
and if the king were on it , what would i do ?
in the country , i would carry out all things by opposites ; because i would n ’ t admit any kind of traffic ; have no one named magistrate ; appeals before a court would n ’ t be recognized ; riches , poverty , and slavery , none ; treaties , lines of succession , propn , boundary lines of land , farming , vineyards , none ; no use of metal , corn , or wine , or oil ; no occupations ; all men idle , all : and women too , only innocent and pure ; no supreme ruler , — but he would be king on it .
no marrying among his subjects ?
none , man : all are idle whores and rogues .
i would govern with perfection like yours , sir , to surpass the golden age .
save his propn !
long live propn !
i really do believe your highness ; and did it to provide opportunity to these gentlemen , who have similar common sense and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing .
it was you we laughed at .
who is nothing to you in this kind of merry joking , so you may continue and still laugh at nothing .
what a hard blow that was !
if it had not fallen dead flat .
you are gentlemen of brave spirit : you would lift the moon out of her orbit if she would continue in it for five weeks without changing .
we would so , and then go swindling .
no , good my lord , do n ’ t be angry .
no , i promise you ; i wo n ’ t risk my reputation so stupidly .
will you laugh me asleep , because i am exhausted ?
go to sleep , and listen to us .
i wish my eyes would shut up my thoughts by closing : i think they want to do so .
we two , my lord , will guard your person while you sleep , and watch for your safety .
thank you .
amazingly sleepy !
what a strange drowsiness possesses them !
it is the nature of the climate .
why does n ’ t then make our eyelids close ?
i do n ’ t find myself wanting to sleep .
me either : i ’ m wide awake .
they all fell asleep together , as if they all agreed ; they dropped , as if hit by a thunder - stroke .
are n ’ t you listening to me speak ?
i do : and surely it is a sleepy language , and you talk in your sleep .
what is it you said ?
this is a strange rest , to be asleep with eyes wide open ; standing , speaking , moving , and yet so fast asleep .
noble propn , you let your fortune sleep — die rather : wink while you are waking .
you snore distinctly : there 's meaning in your snores .
well , i am standing water .
i 'll teach you how to flow .
do so : laziness i inherited teaches me to go down , oh !
if you only knew how you appreciate the purpose while you mock it like this !
how , in stripping it bare , you invest more in it !
men that flow backward indeed , most often , run too near to the bottom by their own fear or laziness .
like this , sir : although this lord of weak memory , this man who shall be remembered little when he is buried , here has almost persuaded , — because he 's a spirit of persuasion , only he professes to persuade , — the propn ’ s son is alive , it is as impossible that he 's not drowned as he who sleeps here swims .
i have no hope that he 's not drowned .
to have no hope that he is drowned is another way to have such a high hope , that even propn ca n ’ t see beyond it , but defies belief .
will you agree with me that propn is drowned ?
he 's gone .
then tell me , who 's the next heir of propn ?
propn .
what are you talking about ! —how are you saying ?
it ’ s true , my brother 's daughter is propn of propn ; she also inherits propn ; there is some distance between the two countries .
there is one that can rule propn as well as the man who is sleeping , lords that can talk as much and unnecessarily as this propn : i myself could make propn of these lords .
o , i wish you were of the same mind as i am !
what a sleep this is for your advancement !
do you understand me ?
i think i do .
and how does your happiness advance your own good fortune ?
for all the rest , they 'll take a suggestion as a cat licks up milk : they 'll turn the clock to any business that we say is right for the hour .
your case , dear friend , shall be my authority for what i do : as you go to propn , i 'll come by propn .
draw your sword : one stroke shall free you from the taxes which you pay , and i the king shall be devoted to you .
pull out your sword when i do : and when i raise my hand , you do the same , so that it falls on propn .
while you lie here snoring , open - eyed plotting takes his time .
if you care about your life , shake off slumber , and beware .
now , good angels preserve the propn !
why , how is it now !
ho , awake !
why are your swords drawn ?
what 's the matter ?
it was most terrible to hear .
i heard nothing .
did you hear this , propn ?
on my honor , sir , i heard a humming , and it was a strange one too , which woke me up .
lead us away from this place : and let 's search further for my poor son .
heavens protect him from these beasts !
because he is surely on the island .
lead us away .
all the diseases that the sun sucks up from bogs , swamps , flats , fall on propn and make him a disease inch by inch !
his spirits listen to me , and yet i have to curse .
here comes a spirit of his , to torment me for bringing in wood too slowly .
i 'll fall down flat ; maybe he wo n ’ t notice me .
a fish : he smells like a fish : a very old and fish - like smell ; a kind that ’ s not like the freshest small fish .
a strange fish !
when they wo n ’ t give a penny to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten dollars to see a dead indian .
he has legs like a man , and his fins look like arms !
warm , honestly !
i now give my opinion : hold it no longer ; this is no fish , but an islander , that has lately been struck by lightning .
propn ] propn , the storm has come again !
i will stay covered here until the last of the storm is over .
this is a nasty tune too : but here 's my comfort .
what 's the matter ?
do we have devils here ?
i have not escaped drowning to be afraid now of your four legs ; because it has been said , “ as proper a man as ever went on four legs ca n ’ t make him give ground ” : and it shall be said so again , while propn still breathes through his nostrils .
this is some monster of the island with four legs , who has got , as i take it , malaria .
where the devil should he learn our language ?
he 's having a fit now and does n ’ t talk sense .
four legs and two voices ; a most delicate monster !
his forward voice now is speaking well of his friend ; his backward voice is uttering dirty speeches and insults .
if all the wine in my bottle will help him , i will help his malaria .
come .
amen !
i will pour some in your other mouth .
stephano !
does your other mouth call me ?
if you are propn , come out .
you are very propn indeed !
how did you come to be the attack of this dreamer ?
can he spit out propn ?
i took him to be killed with lightning .
but are n ’ t you drowned , propn ?
i hope now you are n ’ t drowned .
hass the storm blown over ?
i hid myself under the dead dreamer ’ s covering because i was afraid of the storm .
and are you living , propn ?
o propn , two propn escaped !
please , do n ’ t turn me around so much : my stomach is upset .
how did you escape ?
how did you come here ?
swear by this bottle how you came here — i escaped on a barrel of wine , which the sailors heaved overboard , by this bottle !
which i made of the bark of a tree , with my own hands , since i was cast ashore .
i 'll swear on that bottle to be your true subject , because that liquor is not earthly .
passing the bottle ] here , kiss the book [ gives trinculo a drink ] .
though you can swim like a duck , you are made like a goose .
have you not dropped from propn ?
out of the moon , i assure you : i was the propn in the propn , a long time ago .
the propn in the propn !
i 'll show you every fertile inch of the island ; and i will kiss your foot .
please , be my god .
come on , then ; down , and swear .
i shall laugh myself to death at this puppy - headed monster .
a most nasty monster !
i could find it in my heart to beat him , — come , kiss .
i 'll show you the best springs ; i 'll pluck you berries ; i 'll fish for you , and get you enough wood .
a plague on the tyrant that i serve !
i 'll carry no more sticks for him , but follow you , you amazing man .
a most ridiculous monster , to make a a poor drunkard amazing !
please , let me bring you where crabs grow ; and i will dig you peanuts with my long nails ; i ’ ll show you a bird 's nest , and teach you how to catch the nimble monkey ; i 'll bring you to clustering filbert nuts , and sometimes i 'll get you young falcons from the rock .
will you go with me ?
propn , master ; goodbye , goodbye !
i 'll make no more mothers for fish ; or fetch in firing wood when asked to , or scrape dishes , or wash dishes ; ' propn ' propn , propn — propn , has a new master — get a new man .
freedom , high day !
high - day , freedom !
freedom , high - day , freedom !
o brave monster !
lead the way .
this mean task of mine would be as heavy to me as hateful , except that the mistress i serve makes alive what 's dead , and makes my labors pleasurable : oh !
she is ten times more gentle than her crabby father , and he 's made of harshness .
i forget : but these sweet thoughts even refresh my work , keep me very busy , at least when i do it .
o most dear mistress , the sun will set before i finish what i must work to do .
if you 'll sit down , i 'll carry your logs the while .
please give me that ; i 'll carry it to the pile .
it would be as natural to me as it is to you : and i should do it much more easily , because my good will is in it , and yours is against it .
aside ] poor worm !
you look tired .
no , noble mistress ; it is fresh morning with me when you are near at night .
propn propn that i might say it in my prayers— what is your name ?
miranda — o my father !
i have broken his command not to say so .
propn propn !
indeed , the top of admiration ; worth what 's dearest to the world !
so perfect and so peerless , are created out of every creature 's best virtues .
but i jabber on a little too wildly , and there i am forgetting my father 's lessons .
do you love me ?
i , beyond all limit of whatever else in the world , do love , prize , honor you .
i am a fool to cry at what i am happy about .
aside ] fair meeting of two most rare loves !
heavens rain grace on that which grows between them !
why do you cry ?
at my unworthiness , that dares not offer to you what i desire to give you , or much less take what i shall die to want from you .
but this is a little thing ; and it seeks to hide itself all the more , it shows how big it is .
here , bashful cunning !
and prompt me , plain and holy innocence !
i am your wife , if you will marry me ; if not , i 'll die your virgin .
you may deny me to be your friend ; but i 'll be your servant , whether you will want me or not .
my mistress , dearest ; and i am humble forever .
my husband , then ?
yes , with a heart as willing as slavery was ever willing of freedom : here 's my hand .
and mine , with my heart in it : and now goodbye until half an hour later .
a thousand thousand !
i 'll go to my book ; because still , before supper time , i must complete a lot of business relating to these two .
servant - monster !
the folly of this island !
they say there 's only five on this island ; we ’ re three of them ; if the other two are brained like us , the state shakes .
where else should they be set ?
he would be a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail .
you shall be my lieutenant , monster , or my main officer .
your lieutenant , if you like ; he 's no main officer .
we 'll not run , propn monster .
or leave either : but you 'll lie like dogs , and still say nothing neither .
propn , speak once in your life , if you are a good dreamer .
how does your honor ?
let me lick your shoe .
i wo n ’ t serve him : he ’ s not valiant .
why , you deboshed fish you , was there ever a coward that has drunk so much sack as i have today ?
will you tell a monstrous lie , being only half fish and half a monster ?
look , how he mocks me !
will you let him , my lord ?
look , look again !
bite him to death , please .
the poor monster 's my subject , and he shall not suffer indignity .
i thank my noble lord .
will it please you to listen once again to the favor i asked you ?
as i told you before , i am subject to a tyrant , sorcerer , that has cheated me of the island by his cunning .
you lie .
trinculo , if you trouble him any more in his tale , by this hand , i will displace some of your teeth .
why , i said nothing .
you shall be lord of it , and i 'll serve you .
how shall this be done ?
can you bring me to the party ?
you lie : you ca n ’ t .
what a drunken imbecile is this !
trinculo , run into no further danger : interrupt the monster one word more and , i swear , i 'll turn you out of doors , and make a dried fish out of you .
why , what did i do ?
i did nothing .
i 'll go farther away .
did n ’ t you say he lied ?
you lie .
did i ?
take that .
as you like this , give me the lie again .
ha , ha , ha !
beat him enough : after a little time , i 'll beat him too .
stand farther away .— come on , continue .
remember to possess his books first , because , without them , he 's only a fool , as i am , and has n ’ t one spirit to command : they all hate him as deeply as i do .
is it so brave a girl ?
do you like the plot , propn ?
excellent .
yes , on my honor .
you make me happy : i am full of pleasure .
at your request , monster , i will do reason , any reason .
come on , propn , let us sing .
flout them and scout them ; and scout them and flout them : thought is free .
that 's not the tune .
what is this noise ?
this is the tune of our song , played by the picture of nobody .
o , forgive me my sins !
are you afraid ?
no , monster , not me .
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about my ears ; and sometimes voices , that , if i then had wakened after long sleep , will make me sleep again : and then , in dreaming , the clouds i thought would open and show riches ready to drop on me ; that , when i wakened , i cried to dream again .
this will prove a brave kingdom to me , where i shall have my music for nothing .
when prospero is destroyed .
he lays it on .
will you come ?
i 'll follow , propn .
be patient , i have to rest .
old lord , i ca n ’ t blame you .
i am so exhausted my spirits are dulled ; sit down and rest .
well , let him go .
i am very glad that he 's so out of hope .
do n ’ t , for one denial , lose the action that you swore to do .
we will take the next advantage thoroughly .
what music is this ?
my good friends , listen !
marvelous sweet music !
give us kind keepers , heavens !
what were these ?
a living puppet show .
now i will believe that there are unicorns ; that in propn there is one tree , the throne of the phoenix ; one phoenix reigning there now .
if i should report this now in propn , would they believe me ?
if i should say , i saw similar propn because , truly , these are people of the island , — who , though , they are of monstrous shape , yet , notice that their manners are more gentle than those of our human generation that you shall find many , no , almost any .
honest lord , what you say is true , because some of you there present are worse than devils .
praise in departing .
they vanished strangely .
not i .
truly , sir , you do n ’ t need to be afraid .
when we were boys , who would believe that there were mountaineers covered with dew like bulls , who had throats with pockets of flesh hanging from them ?
or that there were similar men whose heads were in their chests ?
now we find that one traveler out of five will bring us propn about them .
you are three men of sin , whom propn , that has the power over this lower world and what is in it , — has caused the never - satisfied sea to spit up you ; and on this island where man does n ’ t live , you among men being most unfit to live .
i have made you crazy : and even with similar courage , men hang and drown themselves .
you fools !
if you could hurt us , your swords are now too heavy for your strengths , and wo n ’ t be lifted up .
but , remember— because that 's my business to you , — that you three from propn replaced good prospero ; exposed him and his innocent child to the sea , which has repaid it : for which evil deed , the powers , delaying but not forgetting , have angered the seas and shores , yes , all the creatures , against your peace of mind .
in the name of something holy , sir , why stand you here in this strange stare ?
therefore my son is embedded in the ooze ; and i 'll seek him deeper than a piece of lead ever measured how deep the water is , and i will lie there with him in the mud .
give me only one evil enemy at a time , and i 'll fight their legions again and again .
i 'll be right behind you .
i beg you , whose joints move easier than mine to follow them swiftly and stop them from what this vision may now provoke them to do .
if i have punished you too harshly , your payment makes up for it , because i have given you here a third of my own life , or the part for which i live , who , once again , i give to you .
i would believe it against a fortuneteller .
what , propn !
my hard - working servant , propn !
what would my powerful master like ?
here i am .
you and your meaner fellows performed your last jobs very well , and i must use you in another similar trick .
right now ?
yes , with a twink .
before you can say , “ come ” and “ go , ” and breathe twice , and cry “ so , so , ” each one , tripping on his toe , will be here with tricks and pranks .
do you love me , master ?
no ?
dearly , my delicate propn .
do n ’ t come near until you hear me call .
well , i understand .
i promise you , sir , the cold , white , virgin snow on my heart propn back my passion .
propn now come , my propn !
bring a conclusion , rather than need a spirit : appear , and quickly .
no talking !
all eyes !
be silent .
approach , rich propn , to entertain her .
to celebrate a contract of true love , and to bestow some free gifts on the blessed lovers .
tell me , heavenly rainbow , if you know , if propn the goddess of love or propn , her son , now wait on the queen ?
since they plotted with the dark god of the underworld to kidnap my daughter , i have sworn not to be in her and her blind boy 's scandalous company .
do n ’ t be afraid of her company .
they thought they would do some naughty charm on this man and maiden , who have vowed that they will not sleep together until the god of marriage 's torch is lit , but they thought so in vain .
propn propn of propn , propn propn comes ; i know her by her walk .
how does my generous sister ?
go with me to bless these two , that they may be prosperous , and honored in their children .
honor , riches , marriage - blessing , long life , and many children , hourly joys be always yours !
propn sings her blessings on you .
propn 's increase , plenty of feasting , propn and storage for game never empty ; vines growing with clustering bunches of grapes ; plants bowing with heavy loads of fruit ; spring come to you as long as possible , even to the very end of harvest !
scarcity and want shall ignore you ; propn ' blessing so be on you .
spirits , which , by my magic , i have called from their borders to enact my present wishes .
propn now , silence !
you nymphs , called propn propn , of the winding brooks , with your oat - edged crowns and always harmless looks , leave your fresh waters , and answer your summons to this green land : propn commands you .
you sun - burned reapers , tired of propn , come here from the rows you have plowed and be happy : make it a holiday : put on your rye - straw hats , and meet every one pf these fresh nymphs in country dancing .
well done !
avoid ; no more !
these our actors , as i told you before , were all spirits and have melted into air , into thin air : and , like the invisible fabric of this vision , the cloud - capped towers , the gorgeous palaces , the solemn temples , the great world itself , yes , all who inherit it , shall dissolve and leave not even a clue behind , as this pageant of no substance faded .
do n ’ t be disturbed by my weakness .
we wish your peace .
i hang onto your thoughts .
what 's your pleasure ?
propn , we must prepare to meet with propn .
tell me again , where did you leave these varlets ?
i told you , sir , they were red - hot with drinking ; so full of smoothness that they beat the air for breathing in their faces ; beat the ground for kissing their feet ; yet always bending towards their project .
well done , my bird .
a devil , a born devil , on whose nature propn can never stick ; on whom my pains , taken humanely are all , all lost , quite lost ; and as his body grows uglier with age , so his mind is diseased .
i will plague them all , even to the point of their roaring .
come , hang them on this line .
monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played us for fools .
monster , i smell all horse - piss , at which my nose is highly offended .
if i should take a displeasure against you , look you , — you were only a lost monster .
i will fetch off my bottle , although i ’ ll be head over heels in muck for my efforts .
please , my king , be quiet .
do that good deed which may make this island your own forever , and i , your propn , your foot - licker forever .
o propn propn !
o peer !
o worthy propn !
look what a wardrobe is here for you !
let it alone , you fool ; it is only trash .
o , ho , monster !
your grace shall have it .
the swelling disease drown this fool !
what do you mean by being so stupidly fond like this on such goods ?
let 's get going and do the murder first .
if he awakens , he 'll fill our skins with pinches from toe to head ; turn us into strange stuff .
i ’ ll have none of it .
we shall lose our opportunity , and we ’ ll all be turned into geese , or into apes with villainous , low foreheads .
go on ; carry this .
and this .
yes , and this .
hey , propn , hey !
silver !
there it goes , silver !
fury , fury !
there , propn , there !
go , order my goblins that they torment their joints with dry convulsions ; shorten up their muscles with long - lasting cramps , and make them more spotted with pinches than a leopard , or mountain cat .
listen , they roar .
let them be hunted soundly .
what time is it ?
six o ’ clock , at which time , my lord , you said our work should end .
i said so when first i raised the storm .
tell me , my spirit , how are the propn and his followers doing ?
confined together in the same fashion as you told me ; just as you left them : all prisoners , sir , in the grove of trees which weatherproofs your dwelling ; they ca n ’ t budge until you release them .
do you think so , spirit ?
mine would , sir , if i were human .
go release them , propn .
i 'll break my spells , i 'll restore their senses , and they shall be themselves again .
i 'll fetch them , sir .
you elves of hills , brooks , standing lakes , and groves ; and you that chase the ebbing ocean on the sands without leaving a foot print , and run from him when he comes back ; you half - puppets that make the green ringlets sour by moonshine , where the ewe does n ’ t bite ; and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrooms that are happy to hear the curfew sound ; by whose aid , — weak masters though you are , — i have dimmed the noontide sun , called the mutinous winds , and set roaring between the green sea and the blue sky : i haven given fire to the dreaded propn thunder , and split propn 's stout oak with his own lightning bolt : i have made the strong - based propn that stuck out into the ocean shake ; and plucked up the pine and cedar by the roots : at my command , graves have awakened the dead , opened the coffins , and let them walk out by my so powerful magic .
a solemn song , and the best comforter to an unsettled mind , cure for your brains , now useless , boiled inside your skull !
propn propn , honorable man , my eyes , even sociable to the show of your eyes , cry like yours .
the charm dissolves quickly ; and as the morning steals on into the night , melting the darkness , so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that cloud their clearer reason .— o good propn !
their understanding propn to increase , and the approaching tide of understanding will shortly fill the reasonable shores of their minds that are now corrupt and muddy .
where the bee sucks , there suck i : in a flower ’ s bell i lie ; there i sleep when owls cry .
why , that 's my delicate propn !
i drink in the air before me , and return before your pulse beats twice .
all torment , trouble , wonder and amazement live here .
some heavenly power guide us out of this fearful country !
first , noble friend , let me embrace you , whose honor ca n ’ t be measured or confined .
i wo n ’ t swear whether this is or is not true .
the devil speaks in him .
no .
because you , most wicked sir , whom to call brother would even infect my mouth , i forgive your worst fault , all of them , and require my dukedom from you , which i know you must restore to me by necessity .
if you are prospero , give us details of how you were saved ; how you have met us here , who were wrecked on this shore three hours ago , where i have propn how sharp the point of this memory is ! — my dear son propn .
i am very sorry about it , sir .
the loss can not be repaid , and patience says it is beyond her cure .
i rather think you have n ’ t sought her help , by whose soft grace , i have received her royal aid for a similar loss , and i am at peace .
you a similar loss !
as great to me , as recently ; and , to make the dear propn tolerable , i have much weaker means than you have to comfort you , because i have lost my daughter .
a daughter ?
when did you lose your daughter ?
in this last storm .
i see these lords so much admire at this meeting that they eat their own common sense , and scarcely think their eyes tell them the truth .
their words are natural breath , but , however you have been jostled out of your senses , know for certain that i am prospero , and that very duke who was thrown out of propn , who most strangely landed on this shore , where you were wrecked , to be the lord of it .
no more yet about this ; because it is a story of day by day , not a story for a breakfast or propn this first meeting .
here i have few attendants and subjects none .
please , look in .
since you have given me my dukedom again , i will repay you with just as good a thing ; at least bring out a wonder , to make you as happy as i am to have my dukedom .
sweet lord , you lie to me .
no , my dearest love , i would n ’ t for the world .
yes , you would argue for a score of kingdoms , and i would call it fair play .
if this proves to be a vision of the island , i shall lose one dear son twice .
a most high miracle !
now all the blessings of a glad father are all around you !
stand up , and say how you came here .
o , wonder !
how many goodly creatures are there here !
how beautiful mankind is !
o brave new world that has such people in it !
it ’ s new to you .
who is this maiden with whom you were at play ?
propn , she is mortal ; but , by immortal propn , she 's mine .
i chose her when i could n ’ t ask my father for his advice , or did n ’ t think i had a father .
she is daughter to this famous propn of propn , who i have so often heard has a great reputation , but that i never saw before ; of whom i have received a second life : and this lady makes him a second father to me .
i am hers : only , oh !
how oddly it will sound that i must ask my child for forgiveness !
i have wept inside , or should have spoken before this .
i say , amen , propn !
was the propn of propn thrown out of propn , that his children should become kings of propn ?
o , rejoice beyond a common joy , and set it down with gold on lasting pillars .
in one voyage , propn found her husband at propn , and propn , her brother , found a wife where he himself was lost ; prospero found his dukedom in a poor island ; and all of us found ourselves , when no man was in his right minds .
let it be so .
amen !
here are more of us .
i prophesied that , if a gallows were on land , this fellow could not drown .
now , you blasphemer , who sent grace overboard with propn , do n ’ t you have an oath on shore ?
do n ’ t you have any mouth on land ?
what ’ s the news ?
the best news is that we have safely found our king and company : the next , our ship , — which only three hours ago was wrecked , we thought— is water - tight and ready , and bravely rigged as when we first put out to sea .
propn , i have done all this service since i left you .
if i thought , sir , that i was well awake , i 'd try to tell you .
bravely , my hard worker .
you shall be free .
how are you , my gracious sir ?
there are still some few odd lads missing from your company that you forget .
every man is on his own for all the rest , and let no man take care for himself , because all is only fortune .— propn !
bully - monster , propn !
if these are true eyes in my head , here 's a goodly sight .
o propn , these are brave spirits indeed .
how fine my master is !
i ’ m afraid he will beat me .
ha , ha !
what are these things , my lord antonio ?
will money buy them ?
very likely ; one of them is a plain fish , and , no doubt , marketable .
i shall be pinched to death .
is n ’ t this propn , my drunken butler ?
i have been in similar a pickle since i saw you last that , i ’ m afraid , will never get out of my bones .
i wo n ’ t be afraid of blow flies .
why , how is it now , propn !
oh !
do n ’ t touch me : i am not propn , but a cramp .
you 'd be king of the island , servant ?
i should have been a sore one , then .
this is as strange a thing as i have ever looked on .
yes , i will ; and i 'll be wise hereafter , and seek for grace .
what a three times two ass i was , to take this drunkard for a god , and worship this dull fool !
get going ; away !
here , and your baggage back where you found it .
or stole it , rather .
i long to hear the story of your life , which must affect the ear strangely .
