<SOS> what ’ s the matter , lieutenant ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll beat him until the welts look like basket - weave ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll beat me ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you talking , you villain ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , do n ’ t hit him , lieutenant ! <EOS>
<SOS> please , sir , restrain yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> let me go , or i ’ ll knock you on the head . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , you ’ re drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> drunk ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , lieutenant — propn , gentlemen — propn — propn — propn , propn — propn , men ! —the night guard is coming ! <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s sounding that alarm ? <EOS>
<SOS> the whole town will riot ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll be ashamed of this forever ! <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter here ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll kill him ! <EOS>
<SOS> stop right now ! <EOS>
<SOS> stop ! <EOS>
<SOS> stop ! <EOS>
<SOS> the general is talking to you ! <EOS>
<SOS> stop , for propn ’ s sake ! <EOS>
<SOS> for propn ’ s sake , stop this savage brawl ! <EOS>
<SOS> the next man who swings his sword must not care about his life , because the instant he strikes , he dies . <EOS>
<SOS> stop that alarm from ringing , it ’ s scaring the islanders . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter here , gentlemen ? — propn propn , you look upset . <EOS>
<SOS> answer me . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re famous for it . <EOS>
<SOS> what in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell me . <EOS>
<SOS> othello , i ’ ve been seriously hurt . <EOS>
<SOS> i did n ’ t do anything wrong that i know of , unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me . <EOS>
<SOS> all right , now i ’ m starting to lose my cool . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s unbelievably bad . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , who started it ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re hitting close to home there . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but i do n ’ t think it ’ ll hurt him to tell the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> they were nearly killing each other , as you saw when you pulled them apart . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t tell you anything else . <EOS>
<SOS> propn was wrong to hurt propn , who was only trying to help him , but i ’ m sure the guy who ran away must have offended propn in some terrible way , and propn could n ’ t let it pass . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll make you an example for the others to learn from . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter , dear ? <EOS>
<SOS> everything propn fine , now , sweetheart . <EOS>
<SOS> are you hurt , lieutenant ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , but no doctor can help me . <EOS>
<SOS> oh i hope that ’ s not true ! <EOS>
<SOS> you know i ’ m powerful enough to make you pay for this . <EOS>
<SOS> please wait , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> why are you talking about robbery ? <EOS>
<SOS> we come here to help you and you treat us like thugs , but you let an african horse climb all over your daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> your grandsons will neigh to you like horses . <EOS>
<SOS> your whole family will be ruined . <EOS>
<SOS> what kind of crude jerk are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> the kind that tells you that the propn is having sex with your daughter right now . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a senator ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re going to pay for this , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i know who you are . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll answer for everything . <EOS>
<SOS> my reputation , my reputation ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my reputation , propn , my reputation ! <EOS>
<SOS> i swear i thought you meant you ’ d been hurt physically . <EOS>
<SOS> your physical health matters more than your reputation . <EOS>
<SOS> you have n ’ t lost it unless you think you have . <EOS>
<SOS> there are lots of ways to get on the general ’ s good side again . <EOS>
<SOS> go to him , petition him . <EOS>
<SOS> drunk ? <EOS>
<SOS> babbling senselessly ? <EOS>
<SOS> squabbling ? <EOS>
<SOS> swaggering ? <EOS>
<SOS> ranting and raving to my own shadow ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , wine is the devil ! <EOS>
<SOS> who were you chasing with your sword ? <EOS>
<SOS> what did he do to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> is that possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> i remember a jumble of impressions , but nothing distinctly . <EOS>
<SOS> i remember a fight , but not why we were fighting . <EOS>
<SOS> why do we party until we ’ re like animals ? <EOS>
<SOS> you seem all right now . <EOS>
<SOS> how did you get better ? <EOS>
<SOS> one weakness led to another , to make me hate myself . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , you ’ re being too hard on yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish none of this had happened , given the situation here , and your rank . <EOS>
<SOS> but since this has happened , you should fix it for your own good . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll ask him for my position back again , and he ’ ll tell me i ’ m a drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> even if i had a whole bunch of mouths , i would n ’ t be able to answer that . <EOS>
<SOS> i was a reasonable man , then i became a fool , and finally a beast ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , how strange ! <EOS>
<SOS> every glass of liquor is damned , and the devil propn the main ingredient ! <EOS>
<SOS> come on now , wine is good for you , if you know how to use it . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t say anything bad about wine anymore . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i think you know i ’ m your friend . <EOS>
<SOS> i know that , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> imagine , me , a drunk ! <EOS>
<SOS> any man can get drunk sometime . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll tell you what to do . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s wife has a lot of influence now . <EOS>
<SOS> ask her to help you get back your position . <EOS>
<SOS> she is so generous , kind , and ready to help that she thinks it ’ s wrong not to do everything she can , even more than she is asked to do . <EOS>
<SOS> ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s good advice . <EOS>
<SOS> i believe it completely . <EOS>
<SOS> early in the morning i ’ ll go visit propn and plead my case . <EOS>
<SOS> my situation is desperate . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re doing the right thing . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , lieutenant . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , honest iago . <EOS>
<SOS> who can say i ’ m evil when my advice is so good ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s really the best way to win the propn back again . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s easy to get propn on your side . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s full of good intentions . <EOS>
<SOS> how am i evil to advise propn to do exactly what ’ ll do him good ? <EOS>
<SOS> when devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces , just like i ’ m doing now . <EOS>
<SOS> the more she <EOS>
<SOS> and that ’ s how i ’ ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all . <EOS>
<SOS> hello , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve spent most of my money , and tonight i got beaten up . <EOS>
<SOS> so with no money , but a little more wisdom , i ’ m going back to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a poor man if you ’ re this impatient ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , it heals gradually . <EOS>
<SOS> we achieve things with our intelligence , not by magic , and intelligent planning takes time . <EOS>
<SOS> are n ’ t things going well ? <EOS>
<SOS> my propn , it ’ s morning . <EOS>
<SOS> all this excitement has made the time fly by . <EOS>
<SOS> go back to where you ’ re staying and go to sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> go . <EOS>
<SOS> now two things still need to be done . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll put her on that . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , that ’ s the way i ’ ll do it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll pay you for your trouble . <EOS>
<SOS> are these wind instruments ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , they are . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , there ’ s the problem . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the problem ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , we ’ ll stop , then . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ ve got any music that ca n ’ t be heard , then play that . <EOS>
<SOS> but as i said , the general is n ’ t really in the mood to hear music now . <EOS>
<SOS> we do n ’ t have any music that ca n ’ t be heard . <EOS>
<SOS> then pack up your instruments and go away . <EOS>
<SOS> go ! <EOS>
<SOS> do you hear , my friend ? <EOS>
<SOS> please do n ’ t play games . <EOS>
<SOS> propn she ’ s awake , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> if she feels like coming over here , i ’ ll give her your message . <EOS>
<SOS> good to see you , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you did n ’ t go to sleep , then ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m going to ask her to let me talk to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly thank you . <EOS>
<SOS> even for a good morning , lieutenant . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sorry about what happened , but i ’ m sure everything will turn out all right . <EOS>
<SOS> the general and his wife are talking about it now , and she ’ s defending you strongly . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn says the man you hurt is very important in propn , and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you . <EOS>
<SOS> but he says he still loves and respects you , and based on his own feelings alone he ’ s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back . <EOS>
<SOS> please find a way to give me some time alone with propn , if you think that ’ s all right . <EOS>
<SOS> please come in . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll take you to a place where you can speak freely . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you very much . <EOS>
<SOS> iago , give these letters to the ship ’ s captain who brought me here , and ask him to pay my respects to the propn of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> now that ’ s done , i ’ m going to walk on the fortification walls . <EOS>
<SOS> i will , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> shall we go see this fortification , men ? <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ re at your service , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do everything i can for you , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> please do , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , my lady . <EOS>
<SOS> but those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service , especially if i ’ m gone and someone else has my job . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband will never get a moment ’ s rest , i ’ ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out <EOS>
<SOS> but if you did n ’ t know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d never play pranks on you . <EOS>
<SOS> if she is , you can sue me for lying to you . <EOS>
<SOS> light the candles ! <EOS>
<SOS> wake up my whole household ! <EOS>
<SOS> i dreamt about this . <EOS>
<SOS> give me some light ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s time for me to say goodbye to you . <EOS>
<SOS> it would be inappropriate — dangerous , even — for me to be seen working against the propn , as i would if i stayed . <EOS>
<SOS> of patience . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m your advocate , and i ’ d rather die than give up on you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , here comes your husband . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i ’ d better leave now . <EOS>
<SOS> why not stay and hear me talk to him ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m very uncomfortable , and that wo n ’ t help my case . <EOS>
<SOS> well , do whatever you think best . <EOS>
<SOS> hey ! <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t like that . <EOS>
<SOS> what did you say ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , my lord , or if i did — i do n ’ t know what . <EOS>
<SOS> was n ’ t that propn leaving my wife ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i really think it was him . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s this , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i was talking to a petitioner here just now , someone who ’ s suffering from your anger . <EOS>
<SOS> who do you mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> your lieutenant , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , if i ’ ve got any influence over you at all , please patch things up with him . <EOS>
<SOS> please call him and tell him to come back here . <EOS>
<SOS> was that him just now ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes . <EOS>
<SOS> my love , call him back in here . <EOS>
<SOS> not now , my sweet propn . <EOS>
<SOS> some other time . <EOS>
<SOS> but will it be soon ? <EOS>
<SOS> very soon , because you want it . <EOS>
<SOS> will it be tonight at supper ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , not tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> then tomorrow at dinner ? <EOS>
<SOS> well then , tomorrow night , or propn morning . <EOS>
<SOS> or propn noon or at night , or propn morning . <EOS>
<SOS> please just name a time , but do n ’ t wait more than three days . <EOS>
<SOS> his mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place — though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers . <EOS>
<SOS> so when should he come ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell me , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear , i could do so much— please , no more . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t refuse you anything . <EOS>
<SOS> this is like if i asked you to wear your gloves when it ’ s cold outside , or eat nutritious food , or do something that ’ s good for you . <EOS>
<SOS> if i ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test , it ’ ll be something difficult and terrible . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t deny you anything ! <EOS>
<SOS> but in return , please , do one thing for me : leave me alone for a little while . <EOS>
<SOS> would i ever deny you anything ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye , my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye , my propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll come see you right away . <EOS>
<SOS> propn help me , i love you ! <EOS>
<SOS> my noble lord— what is it , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> when you were wooing propn , did propn propn know about it ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , he knew about it the whole time . <EOS>
<SOS> why do you ask ? <EOS>
<SOS> why are you curious , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i did n ’ t realize he knew her . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , really ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , really ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , really . <EOS>
<SOS> do you see something wrong with that ? <EOS>
<SOS> is n ’ t he an honest man ? <EOS>
<SOS> honest , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> honest , yes , honest . <EOS>
<SOS> as far as i know , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you thinking ? <EOS>
<SOS> thinking , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> thinking , my lord ? ” my propn , you keep repeating everything i say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re thinking something . <EOS>
<SOS> just a minute ago i heard you say you did n ’ t like it when propn left my wife . <EOS>
<SOS> what did n ’ t you like ? <EOS>
<SOS> and when i told you he was involved the whole time i was trying to get propn , you were like , “ oh , really ? ” and then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ re my friend , tell me what you ’ re thinking . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , you know i ’ m your friend . <EOS>
<SOS> i think you are . <EOS>
<SOS> as for propn propn , i think it would be safe for me to swear that he ’ s honest . <EOS>
<SOS> i think so too . <EOS>
<SOS> if they ’ re not honest , they should n ’ t look like they are ! <EOS>
<SOS> absolutely , people should be what they appear to be . <EOS>
<SOS> in that case , i think propn propn an honest man . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i think there ’ s more to this than you ’ re letting on . <EOS>
<SOS> please tell me what you ’ re thinking — even your worst suspicions . <EOS>
<SOS> you want me to say what i ’ m thinking ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re not being a good friend , propn , if you even please do n ’ t ask me to tell you . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you talking about ? <EOS>
<SOS> a good reputation is the most valuable thing we have — men and women alike . <EOS>
<SOS> if you steal my money , you ’ re just stealing trash . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s something , it ’ s nothing : it ’ s yours , it ’ s mine , and it ’ ll belong to thousands more . <EOS>
<SOS> but if you steal my reputation , you ’ re robbing me of something that does n ’ t make you richer , but makes me much poorer . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m going to find out what you ’ re thinking . <EOS>
<SOS> you ca n ’ t find that out , even if you held my heart in your hand you could n ’ t make me tell you . <EOS>
<SOS> what ? <EOS>
<SOS> beware of jealousy , my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a green - eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , what misery ! <EOS>
<SOS> the person who ’ s poor and contented is rich enough . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , help us not be jealous ! <EOS>
<SOS> why are you telling me this ? <EOS>
<SOS> do you think i would live a life of jealousy , tormented by new suspicions every hour ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> if there ’ s any doubt , there is no doubt . <EOS>
<SOS> if you say my wife is beautiful , eats well , loves good company , speaks freely , sings , plays music , and dances well , you ’ re not making me jealous . <EOS>
<SOS> when a woman is virtuous , talents like these just make her better . <EOS>
<SOS> so please listen to me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not talking about proof yet . <EOS>
<SOS> watch out ! <EOS>
<SOS> i know the people of propn well . <EOS>
<SOS> they let propn see things they would n ’ t show their husbands . <EOS>
<SOS> do you really think so ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s right , she did . <EOS>
<SOS> well , there you go . <EOS>
<SOS> she was so young , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft ! <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ m sorry i ’ ve blurted all this out . <EOS>
<SOS> i beg your pardon for loving you too much . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m indebted to you forever . <EOS>
<SOS> you seem a little depressed about this . <EOS>
<SOS> not at all , not at all . <EOS>
<SOS> really , i ’ m afraid you are . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope you remember that i said all this because i love you . <EOS>
<SOS> but i see you ’ re troubled . <EOS>
<SOS> please do n ’ t take what i said more seriously than it deserves to be taken . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> if you take it too seriously , it ’ ll have bad effects that i did n ’ t want it to have . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn a good friend of mine — my lord , i can see you ’ re upset . <EOS>
<SOS> no , not too upset . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye , goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> if you see anything else , let me know . <EOS>
<SOS> tell your wife to watch her . <EOS>
<SOS> leave me alone now , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i ’ ll say goodbye now . <EOS>
<SOS> and affection , even if it ’ s just an act . <EOS>
<SOS> he and i will be there . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s true . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s gone . <EOS>
<SOS> the rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness . <EOS>
<SOS> now , propn , where did you see her ? — oh , that miserable wretch ! —you say you saw her with the propn ? — oh , who would want to be a father ? — how did you know it was her ? — to think she tricked me so easily ! —what did she say to you ? — get me more candles , and wake up all my relatives . <EOS>
<SOS> do you think they ’ re married ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i really think so . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , how did she get out ? <EOS>
<SOS> my own flesh and blood rebels against me ! <EOS>
<SOS> fathers , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent . <EOS>
<SOS> are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray ? <EOS>
<SOS> have you ever heard of anything like that , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , sir , i have . <EOS>
<SOS> i think i can find him . <EOS>
<SOS> giving it back to him . <EOS>
<SOS> that will tell you a lot . <EOS>
<SOS> but in the meantime , just assume that i ’ m paranoid — as i ’ m pretty sure i am — and keep thinking she ’ s innocent , please . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t worry about how i handle it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll say goodbye once more . <EOS>
<SOS> this propn is extremely honest and good , and he knows a lot about human behavior . <EOS>
<SOS> if it turns out that she really is running around on me , i ’ ll send her away , even though it ’ ll break my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> oh what a curse marriage is ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone i love , sharing the rest of her with others . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the plague of important men — our wives betray us more than those of poor men . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s our destiny , like death . <EOS>
<SOS> we are destined to be betrayed when we are born . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , here she comes . <EOS>
<SOS> if she ’ s cheated on me , then propn itself is a fake . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t believe it . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s going on , othello , darling ? <EOS>
<SOS> the nobles of propn whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sorry . <EOS>
<SOS> why are you whispering ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you sick ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have a that ’ s from lack of sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ ll go away . <EOS>
<SOS> let me wrap up your head , and it will feel okay in less than an hour . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , i ’ ll escort you to dinner . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m very sorry you ’ re not feeling well . <EOS>
<SOS> hundred times . <EOS>
<SOS> but she loves it so much ( since propn told her she should always keep it with her ) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn knows what he ’ s going to do with it . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s going on ? <EOS>
<SOS> what are you doing here alone ? <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t snap at me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve got something for you . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve got something for me ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a common what ? <EOS>
<SOS> to have a stupid wife . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , is that so ? <EOS>
<SOS> and what would you give me for the handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> what handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> what handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> the one the propn gave to propn , which you asked me to steal so many times . <EOS>
<SOS> you stole it from her ? <EOS>
<SOS> she dropped it carelessly , and , seizing the opportunity , since i was here , i picked it up . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here it is . <EOS>
<SOS> good girl , give it to me . <EOS>
<SOS> and what are you going to do with it ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s it to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> if you do n ’ t need it for some important reason , then give it back to me . <EOS>
<SOS> poor lady , she ’ ll go crazy when she sees it ’ s missing . <EOS>
<SOS> now go , leave me . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn ’ s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions . <EOS>
<SOS> here he comes . <EOS>
<SOS> no drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s cheating on me ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s with you , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i had no idea she was cheating on me . <EOS>
<SOS> i never saw it or suspected it , so it never hurt me . <EOS>
<SOS> i slept well , ate well , and was happy . <EOS>
<SOS> i never saw propn ’ s kisses on her lips . <EOS>
<SOS> a man who ’ s robbed , but does n ’ t miss what ’ s stolen , is n ’ t robbed at all . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sorry to hear this . <EOS>
<SOS> i would ’ ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her , the lowest - ranking grunts and all , as long as i did n ’ t know anything about it . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , goodbye to my peace of mind ! <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye to my happiness ! <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great ! <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye ! <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums , the flute and the splendid banners , and all those proud displays and pageantry of war ! <EOS>
<SOS> and you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods , goodbye ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s career is over . <EOS>
<SOS> is this possible , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> has it come to this ? <EOS>
<SOS> show me , or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn help me ! <EOS>
<SOS> are n ’ t you a rational human being ? <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t you have any sense at all ? <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> what a horrible world we live in ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s not safe to be straightforward and honest . <EOS>
<SOS> no , stop . <EOS>
<SOS> you should always be honest . <EOS>
<SOS> i should always be wise . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear , i think my wife ’ s faithful , and i think she ’ s not . <EOS>
<SOS> i think you ’ re trustworthy one minute and then not the next . <EOS>
<SOS> i need proof ! <EOS>
<SOS> her reputation was as pure as the snow , but now it ’ s as dirty and black as my own face . <EOS>
<SOS> as long as there are <EOS>
<SOS> i see you ’ re all eaten up with emotion . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sorry i said anything . <EOS>
<SOS> you want proof ? <EOS>
<SOS> want ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i want it , and i ’ ll get it . <EOS>
<SOS> but how ? <EOS>
<SOS> how will you get proof ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you going to hide and watch them having sex ? <EOS>
<SOS> death and damnation ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> i think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched . <EOS>
<SOS> what can i say ? <EOS>
<SOS> what proof is there ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ d be impossible for you to watch them , even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks . <EOS>
<SOS> but if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof , we can get that . <EOS>
<SOS> give me one good reason to think she ’ s cheating on me . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t like what you ’ re asking me to do . <EOS>
<SOS> but since i ’ ve gotten myself involved this far , because i ’ m so stupidly honest and because i like you so much , i ’ ll keep going . <EOS>
<SOS> i recently shared a bed with propn , and i could n ’ t sleep because of a raging toothache . <EOS>
<SOS> monstrous ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , it was just a dream . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a reason for suspicion , even though it ’ s just a dream . <EOS>
<SOS> and it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll tear her to pieces ! <EOS>
<SOS> just tell me this : have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it ? <EOS>
<SOS> if it ’ s the same one— if it ’ s the same one , or any one that belongs to her , then together with the other evidence it ’ s pretty strong . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i ’ d kill that bastard propn forty thousand times if i could ! <EOS>
<SOS> killing him once is not enough revenge . <EOS>
<SOS> now i see it ’ s true . <EOS>
<SOS> my heart feels like it ’ s full of poisonous snakes ! <EOS>
<SOS> be patient , i ’ m telling you . <EOS>
<SOS> you may change your mind later . <EOS>
<SOS> never , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear to propn i ’ ll get revenge . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t get up yet . <EOS>
<SOS> let propn be my witness — propn putting my mind , my heart , and my hands in propn ’ s control . <EOS>
<SOS> let him command me , and i ’ ll do whatever he asks , no matter how violent . <EOS>
<SOS> i accept your devotion with my deepest love . <EOS>
<SOS> within the next three days i want to hear you tell me that propn ’ s dead . <EOS>
<SOS> but let her live . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , damn her , damn her ! <EOS>
<SOS> come away with me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re my lieutenant now . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m yours forever . <EOS>
<SOS> lead the way . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll stop at every house . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll reward you for your troubles . <EOS>
<SOS> why do you say that ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , come on . <EOS>
<SOS> where does he sleep ? <EOS>
<SOS> telling you where he ’ s sleeping is like telling you where i ’ m lying . <EOS>
<SOS> what on earth does that mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know where he ’ s staying , so if i told you he ’ s sleeping here or there , i ’ d be lying . <EOS>
<SOS> can you ask around and find out ? <EOS>
<SOS> find him and tell him to come here . <EOS>
<SOS> tell him i ’ ve spoken to my husband on his behalf , and i think everything will be all right . <EOS>
<SOS> i think i can do that . <EOS>
<SOS> where could i have lost that handkerchief , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> believe me , i ’ d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins . <EOS>
<SOS> this would be enough to make my husband suspect me , if he was n ’ t so free of jealousy . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s not jealous ? <EOS>
<SOS> who , him ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here he comes . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t leave him alone until he gives propn his job back .— how are you , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> hot , hot and moist . <EOS>
<SOS> with a hand like this you need to <EOS>
<SOS> fast and pray to stave off temptations . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a nice hand , an open one . <EOS>
<SOS> but these days , people give each other their hands without their hearts . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know about that . <EOS>
<SOS> now , do n ’ t forget , you promised me something . <EOS>
<SOS> what did i promise , my dear ? <EOS>
<SOS> i sent for propn to come talk with you . <EOS>
<SOS> i have a bad cold that ’ s bothering me . <EOS>
<SOS> lend me your handkerchief . <EOS>
<SOS> here , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> no , the one i gave you . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t have it with me . <EOS>
<SOS> you do n ’ t ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s not good . <EOS>
<SOS> almost read people ’ s thoughts . <EOS>
<SOS> she told my mother that as long as she kept it with her , my father would love and desire her . <EOS>
<SOS> when she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when i got married . <EOS>
<SOS> i did . <EOS>
<SOS> is that possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , it ’ s true . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s magic in its fabric . <EOS>
<SOS> a two - hundred - year - old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance . <EOS>
<SOS> the silk came from sacred silkworms , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts . <EOS>
<SOS> really ? <EOS>
<SOS> is that true ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s absolutely true , so take good care of it . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i had never seen it ! <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> why are you yelling at me so angrily ? <EOS>
<SOS> is it lost ? <EOS>
<SOS> is it gone ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell me , is it missing ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn help me ! <EOS>
<SOS> what do you have to say for yourself ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s not lost , but what if it were ? <EOS>
<SOS> what do you mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m telling you , it ’ s not lost . <EOS>
<SOS> please hire propn again . <EOS>
<SOS> bring me the handkerchief — my mind is full of doubt . <EOS>
<SOS> come on . <EOS>
<SOS> the handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> damn it ! <EOS>
<SOS> and you say he ’ s not jealous ? <EOS>
<SOS> i never saw him like this before . <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ re like stomachs and we ’ re just the food . <EOS>
<SOS> they eat us up hungrily , and when they ’ re full , they vomit us up . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here comes propn and my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s no other way . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s the one who ’ s got to do it . <EOS>
<SOS> go ahead and ask her . <EOS>
<SOS> then i could stop wondering , and find some other career . <EOS>
<SOS> if his face changed as much as his personality has , i would n ’ t recognize him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn knows i have done my best to argue for you , and made him angry at me for being so aggressive . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll just have to be patient for a little while . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do what i can , more than i ’ d do for myself . <EOS>
<SOS> let that be enough for you . <EOS>
<SOS> is othello angry ? <EOS>
<SOS> can he even get angry ? <EOS>
<SOS> if he ’ s angry , there must be something seriously wrong . <EOS>
<SOS> please , do so . <EOS>
<SOS> there must be some political news from propn , or some dangerous plot here in propn has ruined his good mood . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s the way it goes . <EOS>
<SOS> we should n ’ t expect men to be perfect , or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope to propn it ’ s something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you . <EOS>
<SOS> oh no ! <EOS>
<SOS> i never gave him reason to be jealous . <EOS>
<SOS> but jealous people do n ’ t think like that . <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ re never jealous for a reason ; they ’ re just jealous . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s like a monster that just grows and grows , out of nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope propn keeps that monster from growing in propn ’ s mind ! <EOS>
<SOS> amen to that , lady . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll go look for him — propn , stay around here . <EOS>
<SOS> if he ’ s in a good mood i ’ ll mention you again , and do everything i can . <EOS>
<SOS> i thank you , lady . <EOS>
<SOS> hello , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> why are you so far from home ? <EOS>
<SOS> how are you , my pretty propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> to tell you the truth , i was just going to your house . <EOS>
<SOS> and i was just going to yours . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve kept away from me for a week ? <EOS>
<SOS> seven days and seven nights ? <EOS>
<SOS> a hundred and sixty - eight hours ? <EOS>
<SOS> and lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones ! <EOS>
<SOS> what a tedious wait ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , where did you get this ? <EOS>
<SOS> has it come to this ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , well . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , come on , woman . <EOS>
<SOS> well , whose is it ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s pretty . <EOS>
<SOS> so i ’ d like it copied . <EOS>
<SOS> take it and do that for me , and leave me alone for a while . <EOS>
<SOS> leave you alone ! <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m waiting here for the general , and i do n ’ t want him to see me with a woman . <EOS>
<SOS> and why ’ s that ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s not because i do n ’ t love you . <EOS>
<SOS> but you do n ’ t love me . <EOS>
<SOS> please , just walk with me a little ways , and tell me if i ’ ll see you later tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> i can only walk a little way with you , since i ’ m waiting here . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll see you soon . <EOS>
<SOS> all right , have it your way . <EOS>
<SOS> i have to make do . <EOS>
<SOS> nine or ten times i wanted to stab him under the ribs . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s better that you did n ’ t kill him . <EOS>
<SOS> but he kept chattering so foolishly , talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms , that it was hard for me to restrain myself . <EOS>
<SOS> but please tell me , sir , is your marriage let him do his worst . <EOS>
<SOS> the services i have done for the venetian government will count for more than his complaints will . <EOS>
<SOS> do you really think so ? <EOS>
<SOS> what do you mean , do i think so ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , just because they kissed in private ? <EOS>
<SOS> an illicit kiss ! <EOS>
<SOS> maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so , but they did n ’ t do anything . <EOS>
<SOS> naked in bed together , but without doing anything ? <EOS>
<SOS> come on , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> as long as they did n ’ t do anything , it would only be a minor sin . <EOS>
<SOS> but if i gave my wife a handkerchief— then what ? <EOS>
<SOS> her reputation is also her own . <EOS>
<SOS> can she give that away too ? <EOS>
<SOS> but a handkerchief— propn , i wish i could forget about the handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> what you told me it haunts me like a nightmare — he ’ s got my handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> yes , what about it ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s not good . <EOS>
<SOS> what if i ’ d said i saw him do something to hurt you ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , but he ’ d deny it all . <EOS>
<SOS> what did he say ? <EOS>
<SOS> he said he did — i do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> he was in bed propn with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> with her , on top of her — however you want to say it . <EOS>
<SOS> in bed with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> on top of her ? <EOS>
<SOS> my propn , it ’ s nauseating ! <EOS>
<SOS> handkerchief — confessions — handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> noses , ears , lips . <EOS>
<SOS> is it possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> this is the way to trick gullible fools . <EOS>
<SOS> hey , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> this is his second fit like this . <EOS>
<SOS> he had one yesterday . <EOS>
<SOS> rub his temples . <EOS>
<SOS> no , do n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> if you interrupt it , he ’ ll foam at the mouth and go crazy . <EOS>
<SOS> look , he ’ s moving . <EOS>
<SOS> why do n ’ t you go away for a bit ? <EOS>
<SOS> when he leaves , it ’ s very important that i talk to you . <EOS>
<SOS> what happened , general ? <EOS>
<SOS> did you hit your head ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you making fun of me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i wish you could face your bad news like a man ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s subhuman , like an animal . <EOS>
<SOS> did he confess ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , be a man . <EOS>
<SOS> your case is better than that . <EOS>
<SOS> then i ’ ll know exactly what she is , just as i know what i am . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re wise ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s for sure . <EOS>
<SOS> while you were dazed by grief — which is n ’ t appropriate for a man like you — propn showed up here . <EOS>
<SOS> i got him to leave , and made up an excuse for your trance . <EOS>
<SOS> i told him to come back and talk to me in a bit , and he promised he would . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll make him tell me the whole story again — where , how often , how long ago — and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m telling you , just watch his face . <EOS>
<SOS> but stay calm , and do n ’ t get carried away by rage , or i ’ ll think you ’ re not a man . <EOS>
<SOS> do you hear what i ’ m saying , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> will you go hide ? <EOS>
<SOS> now i ’ ll ask propn about propn , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s the whore ’ s curse , to seduce many men , but to be seduced by one . <EOS>
<SOS> whenever he talks about her he ca n ’ t stop laughing . <EOS>
<SOS> and when he laughs , propn will go crazy . <EOS>
<SOS> in his ignorant jealousy , he ’ ll totally misunderstand propn ’ s smiles , gestures , and jokes .— how are you , lieutenant ? <EOS>
<SOS> the poor thing ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s laughing already ! <EOS>
<SOS> i never knew a woman who loved a man so much . <EOS>
<SOS> the poor thing , i really think she loves me . <EOS>
<SOS> now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off . <EOS>
<SOS> have you heard this , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s asking him to tell the story again . <EOS>
<SOS> go on , tell it . <EOS>
<SOS> she says you ’ re going to marry her . <EOS>
<SOS> are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> do you think you ’ ve won ? <EOS>
<SOS> me , marry her ? <EOS>
<SOS> that whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> please give me a little credit ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not that stupid . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> so , so , so , so ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re kidding ! <EOS>
<SOS> all right , then . <EOS>
<SOS> she thinks i ’ ll marry her because she loves me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is gesturing for me to come closer . <EOS>
<SOS> now he ’ s telling the story . <EOS>
<SOS> she was here just now . <EOS>
<SOS> she hangs around me all the time . <EOS>
<SOS> i was talking to some propn down by the shore , and the fool showed up . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> now he ’ s saying how she took him into our bedroom . <EOS>
<SOS> look out , here she comes . <EOS>
<SOS> propn you ! <EOS>
<SOS> what did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> i was an idiot to take it ! <EOS>
<SOS> you want me to copy the embroidery pattern ? <EOS>
<SOS> that was a likely story , that you found it in your room and did n ’ t know who it belonged to . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a love token from some other slut , and you want me to copy its pattern for you ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is it , my dear propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s wrong ? <EOS>
<SOS> my propn , that ’ s my handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> if you want to come have dinner with me , you can . <EOS>
<SOS> if you do n ’ t want to , then good riddance . <EOS>
<SOS> go after her , go . <EOS>
<SOS> actually , i should . <EOS>
<SOS> will you be having dinner with her tonight ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i will . <EOS>
<SOS> did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> and did you see the handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> was it mine ? <EOS>
<SOS> it was yours , i swear . <EOS>
<SOS> and do you see how much your foolish wife means to him ? <EOS>
<SOS> she gave it to him , and he gave it to his whore . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i could keep killing him for nine years straight . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , she ’ s a fine woman ! <EOS>
<SOS> a fair woman ! <EOS>
<SOS> a sweet woman ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , you have to forget all that now . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , let her die and rot and go to hell tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , the world never saw a sweeter creature . <EOS>
<SOS> but that ’ s not how you ’ re going to be . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , she could sing a wild bear to sleep ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , she ’ s so witty and creative ! <EOS>
<SOS> all the worse that she stooped this low , then . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times — and what a sweet personality she has ! <EOS>
<SOS> yes , a little too sweet . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , that ’ s for sure . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , it ’ s dreadful , dreadful , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> if you still feel so affectionate toward her , then why not give her permission to cheat on you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll chop her into pieces . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , it ’ s horrible of her . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s worse . <EOS>
<SOS> get me some poison tonight , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t argue with her , so her beautiful body wo n ’ t disarm me .— tonight , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t do it with poison . <EOS>
<SOS> strangle her in her bed , the same bed she ’ s contaminated . <EOS>
<SOS> good , good , i like that — it ’ s only fair ! <EOS>
<SOS> very good ! <EOS>
<SOS> and let me kill propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll hear more from me by midnight . <EOS>
<SOS> excellent , good . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s her father and his friends , who ’ ve been roused out of bed . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ d better go inside . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i must let them find me . <EOS>
<SOS> my good qualities , my legal status as propn ’ s husband , and my innocence will protect me . <EOS>
<SOS> is it them ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t think so . <EOS>
<SOS> the servants of the propn and my lieutenant ? <EOS>
<SOS> hello , everyone ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s going on ? <EOS>
<SOS> he needs to see you right away . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think he wants ? <EOS>
<SOS> something about propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i think it ’ s important . <EOS>
<SOS> the warships have sent a dozen messages tonight , one after the other , and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the propn propn already . <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ re very anxious for you to get there . <EOS>
<SOS> when you were n ’ t at home , the propn sent out three different search parties to find you . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s good you found me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then i ’ ll go with you . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s that trumpet for ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think someone ’ s coming from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> look , your wife is with him . <EOS>
<SOS> greetings , good general ! <EOS>
<SOS> the duke and senators of propn greet you . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s new , cousin propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> very nice to see you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you . <EOS>
<SOS> how is lieutenant propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , he ’ s alive . <EOS>
<SOS> are you sure of that ? <EOS>
<SOS> excuse me ? <EOS>
<SOS> he did n ’ t say anything , he ’ s reading . <EOS>
<SOS> so there ’ s a rift between propn and propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , unfortunately . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d do anything to bring them back together , since i really care for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn it all ! <EOS>
<SOS> excuse me , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you in your right mind ? <EOS>
<SOS> is he angry ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think they want him to go home and appoint propn governor in his place . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m happy about that . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , are you really ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m glad you ’ re insane enough to admit it in front of me . <EOS>
<SOS> why , sweet propn i have n ’ t done anything to deserve this ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , no one will believe this in propn , even though i ’ d swear i saw it with my own eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> that was too much . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s crying . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you devil , you devil ! <EOS>
<SOS> get out of my sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> i would n ’ t want to stay here and make you angry . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s obedient — a fine lady . <EOS>
<SOS> please , my lord , call her back . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> what do you want with her , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> who , me ? <EOS>
<SOS> see how well she can turn ? <EOS>
<SOS> she can turn and turn , and then turn on you again . <EOS>
<SOS> and she can cry , sir — oh , how she can cry ! <EOS>
<SOS> very obedient — keep crying .— concerning this — oh , what fake emotion ! —i am being ordered home — get away from me , i ’ ll send for you later .— propn , i ’ ll obey the order and return to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn can have my job . <EOS>
<SOS> and tonight , sir , i invite you have dinner with me . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> horny animals ! <EOS>
<SOS> is this the same propn whom the senate considers so capable ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s changed a great deal . <EOS>
<SOS> is he sane ? <EOS>
<SOS> is he losing his mind ? <EOS>
<SOS> he is what he is . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t say anything negative about what he might be . <EOS>
<SOS> if he is n ’ t what he might be , then i wish to propn he were ! <EOS>
<SOS> hitting his wife ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s true , that was n ’ t such a nice thing to do . <EOS>
<SOS> but i wish i could say that ’ s the last time he ’ ll do it ! <EOS>
<SOS> is it a habit of his ? <EOS>
<SOS> or did the letter make him emotional somehow , and this is the first time he ’ s done it ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , it ’ s too bad ! <EOS>
<SOS> it would n ’ t be right for me to tell you everything i ’ ve seen and heard . <EOS>
<SOS> just go after him and watch what he does next . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sorry i was so wrong about him . <EOS>
<SOS> you have n ’ t seen anything , then ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , and i did n ’ t hear anything either , or suspect anything at all . <EOS>
<SOS> but you ’ ve seen her and propn together . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , but i did n ’ t see anything wrong , and i heard every syllable they said . <EOS>
<SOS> did n ’ t they ever whisper ? <EOS>
<SOS> never , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> or ask you to leave the room ? <EOS>
<SOS> never . <EOS>
<SOS> not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s strange . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d swear to you on my soul that she ’ s a good , honest person , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> tell her to come here . <EOS>
<SOS> go . <EOS>
<SOS> she says all the right things , but the dumbest brothel - keeper would tell the same story . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve seen her do it . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , what do you want ? <EOS>
<SOS> please , dear , come here . <EOS>
<SOS> what can i do for you ? <EOS>
<SOS> let me see your eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> look at my face . <EOS>
<SOS> what horrible thing are you imagining ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can tell you ’ re furious , but i do n ’ t understand what you ’ re saying . <EOS>
<SOS> go ahead , swear to that , so you ’ ll be damned to hell for lying . <EOS>
<SOS> propn knows i am . <EOS>
<SOS> propn knows you ’ re as unfaithful as hell . <EOS>
<SOS> unfaithful , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> with whom ? <EOS>
<SOS> how am i unfaithful ? <EOS>
<SOS> leave me alone , propn , go away ! <EOS>
<SOS> because of me ? <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ ve been ordered back to propn because of my father , do n ’ t blame me . <EOS>
<SOS> you may have lost his respect , but so have i . <EOS>
<SOS> even that i could put up with . <EOS>
<SOS> be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from , has rejected me ! <EOS>
<SOS> worse than that , she ’ s polluted herself , so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce ! <EOS>
<SOS> even the goddess of patience could n ’ t look at this and be patient — it ’ s too horrifying ! <EOS>
<SOS> i hope you think i ’ m faithful to you . <EOS>
<SOS> as faithful as flies in rotting meat , which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i wish you ’ d never been born ! <EOS>
<SOS> have i done something to offend you without knowing it ? <EOS>
<SOS> was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> what have you done ? <EOS>
<SOS> what have you done ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you streetwalker ! <EOS>
<SOS> what have you done ? <EOS>
<SOS> you brazen whore ! <EOS>
<SOS> i swear to propn you ’ re accusing me wrongly ! <EOS>
<SOS> so you ’ re saying you ’ re not a whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , i ’ m as honest as i am christian . <EOS>
<SOS> what , you ’ re not a whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , i swear it . <EOS>
<SOS> is that possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn help us ! <EOS>
<SOS> i mistook you for that sly venetian woman who married propn .— you whorehouse - keeper . <EOS>
<SOS> you ! <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ve finished our business . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s some money for you . <EOS>
<SOS> please lock the door and keep quiet . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s he talking about ? <EOS>
<SOS> how are you , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , what ’ s he doing in there ? <EOS>
<SOS> tonight he boarded a treasure ship . <EOS>
<SOS> if he can keep it , he ’ ll be set forever . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t understand . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s married . <EOS>
<SOS> to whom ? <EOS>
<SOS> here comes another group looking for you . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he intends to do something bad to you . <EOS>
<SOS> hey ! <EOS>
<SOS> stop right there ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , it ’ s the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> get him , he ’ s a thief ! <EOS>
<SOS> with who ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t have a lord . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t talk to me , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> things have certainly changed ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s fair for him to treat me like this , very fair . <EOS>
<SOS> what have i ever done that he has anything to complain about ? <EOS>
<SOS> what can i do for you , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> how are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> when grown - ups teach little children , they do it gently and easily . <EOS>
<SOS> he might have treated me like that , because i ’ m as unused to abuse as a little child . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter , lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> he called her a whore so many times , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people ca n ’ t stand to hear it . <EOS>
<SOS> am i that name , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> what name , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> what my lord said i was . <EOS>
<SOS> why did he do that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> i just know i ’ m not one . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t cry , do n ’ t cry . <EOS>
<SOS> what a day this is ! <EOS>
<SOS> did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen , give up her father and country and friends , just to be called a whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> does n ’ t that make you want to cry ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s just my bad luck . <EOS>
<SOS> damn him ! <EOS>
<SOS> how did he get such an idea ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn knows . <EOS>
<SOS> i bet my life some evil busybody , some meddling , lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position . <EOS>
<SOS> i bet my life on it . <EOS>
<SOS> nobody ’ s that bad . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s impossible . <EOS>
<SOS> if there is , then propn help him ! <EOS>
<SOS> why should he call her a whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s been with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> the propn is being tricked by some crook , some terrible villain , some rotten bastard . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i wish we could unmask scoundrels like that , and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with ! <EOS>
<SOS> keep your voice down . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , to hell with those people ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect i ’ d cheated on you with the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a fool . <EOS>
<SOS> shut up . <EOS>
<SOS> oh propn , propn , what can i do to win my husband back again ? <EOS>
<SOS> please go to him , my friend . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear i have no idea why he stopped loving me . <EOS>
<SOS> here i ’ m kneeling to swear that if i ever did anything to destroy his love for me , either by thoughts or actions , or if i ever took pleasure in anyone else , or if i never did love him , or do n ’ t love him now — even though he tries to shake me off— <EOS>
<SOS> then i hope i have a life of misery ! <EOS>
<SOS> unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it ’ ll never destroy my love . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t say “ whore . ” it makes me sick to say the word even now . <EOS>
<SOS> political business is bothering him , and he ’ s just taking it out on you . <EOS>
<SOS> if only that were all it is— it is , i promise . <EOS>
<SOS> those trumpets are calling us in to dinner . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn are waiting for their food . <EOS>
<SOS> go in , and do n ’ t cry . <EOS>
<SOS> everything will be all right . <EOS>
<SOS> how are you , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t think you ’ re treating me fairly . <EOS>
<SOS> what makes you say that ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , i wo n ’ t take it any longer . <EOS>
<SOS> will you listen to me , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> your words and actions do n ’ t match up . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s not fair . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> the jewels you took from me to deliver to propn would ’ ve made even a nun want to sleep with me . <EOS>
<SOS> you told me she got them , and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon , but nothing like that ever happens . <EOS>
<SOS> well , all right then . <EOS>
<SOS> fine . <EOS>
<SOS> fine ! ” he says . <EOS>
<SOS> all right ! ” it ’ s not fine , and i ’ m not all right ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s wrong , and i ’ m starting to realize i ’ m being cheated ! <EOS>
<SOS> okay . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s not okay ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m going to tell propn my feelings . <EOS>
<SOS> if she returns my jewels , i ’ ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her . <EOS>
<SOS> if not , i ’ ll challenge you to a duel . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve said what you have to say now . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , and i ’ ll do everything i just said . <EOS>
<SOS> from this moment on i have a higher opinion of you than before . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> your complaint against me is perfectly understandable , but i still insist i ’ ve done everything i could to help you . <EOS>
<SOS> it does n ’ t look that way to me . <EOS>
<SOS> i admit it does n ’ t look that way to me , and the fact that you suspect me shows that you ’ re smart . <EOS>
<SOS> but propn , if you ’ re as courageous and determined as i think you are , then wait just a bit longer . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ re not having sex with propn tomorrow night , then i suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me . <EOS>
<SOS> well , what ’ s your plan ? <EOS>
<SOS> is it feasible ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn has made propn governor here on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> is that true ? <EOS>
<SOS> then propn and propn will go back to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you mean , get rid of him ? <EOS>
<SOS> i mean knock his brains out , so he ca n ’ t take propn ’ s place . <EOS>
<SOS> and that ’ s what you want me to do ! <EOS>
<SOS> yes , if you want to help yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s having dinner tonight with a prostitute , and i ’ ll go visit him . <EOS>
<SOS> he does n ’ t know he ’ s been appointed governor yet . <EOS>
<SOS> when you see him walking by here ( as i ’ ll make sure he does between twelve and one ) you can nab him . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be nearby to help you , and between the two of us we can handle him . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll give you such reasons for killing him that you ’ ll feel obliged to snuff him out . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s nearly dinner time , and the night propn going to be wasted . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s go ! <EOS>
<SOS> i want to hear more about this . <EOS>
<SOS> you will . <EOS>
<SOS> please , sir , do n ’ t trouble yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re most welcome . <EOS>
<SOS> would you walk out with me , sir ? — oh , propn yes , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> go to bed right this minute . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be there shortly . <EOS>
<SOS> i will , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> how are things now ? <EOS>
<SOS> he looks calmer than he did before . <EOS>
<SOS> send me away ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s what he said . <EOS>
<SOS> so give me my nightgown , propn , and i ’ ll say goodnight . <EOS>
<SOS> we should n ’ t displease him . <EOS>
<SOS> yes . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish you ’ d never met him . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s not what i wish . <EOS>
<SOS> i love him even when he ’ s harsh and mean — help me unpin this , would you ? — i love even his stubbornness , his frowns , his bad moods . <EOS>
<SOS> i put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked . <EOS>
<SOS> it does n ’ t matter . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , how silly we are ! <EOS>
<SOS> if i die before you do make sure i ’ m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin . <EOS>
<SOS> listen to you ! <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t be silly ! <EOS>
<SOS> she knew an old song called “ propn ” that reminded her of her own story , and she died singing it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t get that song out of my head tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s all i can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor barbary . <EOS>
<SOS> please , hurry up . <EOS>
<SOS> should i get your nightgown ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , just help me unpin this . <EOS>
<SOS> that propn is a good - looking man . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s very handsome . <EOS>
<SOS> he speaks well . <EOS>
<SOS> i know a lady in propn who ’ d walk all the way to propn for a kiss from him . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s the wind . <EOS>
<SOS> my eyes itch — is that an omen i ’ ll be crying soon ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , it does n ’ t mean anything . <EOS>
<SOS> i heard someone say that ’ s what it means . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , these men , these men ! <EOS>
<SOS> do you honestly think — tell me , propn — there are women who ’ d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner ? <EOS>
<SOS> there are women like that out there , no question . <EOS>
<SOS> you , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> come on , i ’ ll fight you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do . <EOS>
<SOS> you evil thief , where have you hidden my daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> you devil , you ’ ve put a spell on her ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s obvious to everyone that you ’ ve tricked her , drugged her , or kidnapped her . <EOS>
<SOS> if he struggles , use force ! <EOS>
<SOS> where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ? <EOS>
<SOS> would you ever do such a thing for all the world ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , would n ’ t you ? <EOS>
<SOS> by the light of propn , no , i would not ! <EOS>
<SOS> i would n ’ t either , by daylight . <EOS>
<SOS> it would be easier to do it in the dark . <EOS>
<SOS> could you really do such a thing , for all the world ? <EOS>
<SOS> the world ’ s huge . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a big prize for such a small sin . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t think you would . <EOS>
<SOS> actually i think i would , and then i ’ d undo it after i did it . <EOS>
<SOS> i would n ’ t do it for a nice ring , or fine linen , or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats . <EOS>
<SOS> but for the whole world ? <EOS>
<SOS> who would n ’ t cheat on her husband to make him king ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d risk my soul for that . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , a bad action is just a wrong in this world , but when you ’ ve won the whole world , it ’ s a wrong in your own world , so you can make it right then . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t think any woman like that exists . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , a dozen of them — as many as there are women in the world , in fact . <EOS>
<SOS> but i do think it ’ s the husband ’ s fault if we wives cheat on them . <EOS>
<SOS> for instance , our husbands <EOS>
<SOS> we have feelings . <EOS>
<SOS> husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too . <EOS>
<SOS> they see , smell , and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands . <EOS>
<SOS> i think they do . <EOS>
<SOS> is it out of lust ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think so . <EOS>
<SOS> is it a weakness ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is . <EOS>
<SOS> and do n ’ t we have passions , and a taste for fun , and weaknesses , just like men ? <EOS>
<SOS> then tell them to treat us well . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , good night . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray that propn will let me learn from women like that — not to follow their bad example , but to avoid it ! <EOS>
<SOS> here , stand behind this wall ; he ’ ll come right away . <EOS>
<SOS> quick , quick . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t be afraid . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be right next to you . <EOS>
<SOS> this will either make us or break us . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m right behind you . <EOS>
<SOS> be bold , and get ready . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t really want to do this , but he ’ s given me good reasons . <EOS>
<SOS> i guess it ’ s only one man — no big deal . <EOS>
<SOS> i know the sound of his walk .— die , villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i ’ m dead ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be crippled forever ! <EOS>
<SOS> help ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s propn ’ s voice . <EOS>
<SOS> propn has kept his word . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , what a villain i am ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> help me ! <EOS>
<SOS> get some light ! <EOS>
<SOS> get me a surgeon ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s him ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , how honest and trustworthy you are ! <EOS>
<SOS> you teach me how i should act . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , your lover ’ s dead now , and you ’ ll be going to hell soon . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m coming , slut ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve already stained our sheets with your lust ; now i ’ ll stain them with your whore ’ s blood . <EOS>
<SOS> help ! <EOS>
<SOS> is n ’ t there a guard around ? <EOS>
<SOS> no one passing by ? <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> something propn wrong , the man sounds panicked . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , help ! <EOS>
<SOS> listen ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve acted like such a villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> two or three men are groaning . <EOS>
<SOS> but it ’ s dark out , and it could be a trap . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s not safe to go near them till we get more help . <EOS>
<SOS> nobody ’ s coming ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll bleed to death . <EOS>
<SOS> look ! <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s shouting “ murder ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> we do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> did n ’ t you hear someone shouting ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m here , here ! <EOS>
<SOS> for propn ’ s sake , help me ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s a good man . <EOS>
<SOS> is that you , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m here , i ’ ve been destroyed by villains ! <EOS>
<SOS> help me . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , lieutenant ! <EOS>
<SOS> what villains did this to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think one of them is nearby and ca n ’ t get away . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s one of them . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> you inhuman dog ! <EOS>
<SOS> killing men in the dark ? <EOS>
<SOS> where are these murderers ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you good or evil ? <EOS>
<SOS> judge for yourself . <EOS>

<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s shouting ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s shouting ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my dear propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> my sweet propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> you notorious whore ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , do you know who might have stabbed you like this ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>

<SOS> i ’ ve been looking all over for you . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s fainted ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh propn , propn , propn ! <EOS>

<SOS> i ’ ll get the general ’ s surgeon . <EOS>
<SOS> there was n ’ t any problem . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t even know him . <EOS>
<SOS> keep an eye on her . <EOS>
<SOS> do you see ? <EOS>
<SOS> the guilty speak volumes even when they ’ re silent . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter , husband ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn was attacked here in the dark by propn and men who escaped . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s near death , and propn ’ s dead already . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , no , good gentleman ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh no , good propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> this is what happens when you visit whores . <EOS>
<SOS> please , propn , ask propn where he was at dinner tonight.— <EOS>
<SOS> he ate at my house , but that does n ’ t make me nervous . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , did he ? <EOS>
<SOS> i order you to come with me . <EOS>
<SOS> go to hell , you whore ! <EOS>
<SOS> as moral as me ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn you ! <EOS>
<SOS> gentlemen , let ’ s go make sure propn ’ s wounds are properly dressed .— come on , ma'am , you can tell us another story . <EOS>
<SOS> emilia , go to the castle and tell propn and propn what happened .— will you please go now ? <EOS>
<SOS> to prison , until you ’ re called into court . <EOS>
<SOS> his messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately , on pressing state business . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s true . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn propn in a meeting right now , and he ’ s sent for you too . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn propn in a meeting ? <EOS>
<SOS> at this time of night ? <EOS>
<SOS> bring him with us . <EOS>
<SOS> the law ’ s on my side . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own . <EOS>
<SOS> if we let crimes like this happen , slaves and heathens will be our rulers . <EOS>
<SOS> i have to do it , i have to do it . <EOS>
<SOS> but i wo n ’ t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin , whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble . <EOS>
<SOS> but she ’ s got to die , or she ’ ll cheat on other men . <EOS>
<SOS> put out the light of the candle , and then put out the light of her heart . <EOS>
<SOS> if i extinguish the candle , i can light it again if i regret it . <EOS>
<SOS> when i ’ ve plucked this rose , i ca n ’ t make it grow again ; it will have no choice but to wither and die . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> othello ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> will you come to bed , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , my lord . <EOS>

<SOS> be quick about it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll wait over here . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t want to kill you before you ’ ve readied your soul . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i do n ’ t want to send your soul to hell when i kill you . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re talking about killing ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i am . <EOS>
<SOS> then propn have mercy on me . <EOS>
<SOS> amen to that , from the bottom of my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> if you really feel that way , then i hope you wo n ’ t kill me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know why i should be afraid , since i have n ’ t done anything wrong . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ m still afraid . <EOS>
<SOS> think of your sins . <EOS>
<SOS> my only sin was loving you too much . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , that ’ s why you have to die . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re wrong to kill me for loving you . <EOS>
<SOS> why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re shaking with emotion . <EOS>
<SOS> these are bad omens , but i hope , i hope , they do n ’ t predict my future . <EOS>
<SOS> i will . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s this all about ? <EOS>
<SOS> you gave that handkerchief , the one i loved and gave to you , to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i swear by my life and soul ! <EOS>
<SOS> bring him here and ask him . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re on your deathbed . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ m not dying yet ! <EOS>
<SOS> yes , right now . <EOS>
<SOS> so confess your sin freely now . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re going to die . <EOS>
<SOS> then propn have mercy on me ! <EOS>
<SOS> amen to that . <EOS>
<SOS> and you have mercy on me too ! <EOS>
<SOS> i never gave him any token of romantic love . <EOS>
<SOS> i saw him holding the handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> you liar , you ’ re turning my heart to stone , and making me call what i ’ ll do murder , when i had been thinking of it as a sacrifice ! <EOS>
<SOS> i saw the handkerchief . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s already done so . <EOS>
<SOS> what , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> that he had sex with you . <EOS>
<SOS> what ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes . <EOS>
<SOS> he would n ’ t say that . <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn propn arranged that . <EOS>
<SOS> what , is he dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> if he had as many lives as he ’ s got hairs on his head , i would ’ ve killed them all in revenge . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , he ’ s been betrayed , and i ’ ve been ruined . <EOS>
<SOS> send me away , my lord , but do n ’ t kill me ! <EOS>
<SOS> kill me tomorrow — but let me live tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> no , if you struggle with me— just half an hour ! <EOS>
<SOS> just let me say one prayer ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s too late . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s that noise ? <EOS>
<SOS> are n ’ t you dead yet ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , it ’ s propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter with you now ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , just now , my lord . <EOS>

<SOS> propn ’ s been killed ? <EOS>
<SOS> and propn propn killed ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , propn was n ’ t killed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s not dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> then the wrong man is dead , and sweet revenge has gone wrong . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i ’ ve been murdered unfairly ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh propn , who ’ s that crying ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , no , that was my lady ’ s voice . <EOS>

<SOS> oh sweet mistress , speak ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m dying an innocent woman . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , who did this thing ? <EOS>
<SOS> no one . <EOS>
<SOS> i did it myself . <EOS>
<SOS> give my love to my kind husband . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , goodbye ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , how could she have been murdered ? <EOS>
<SOS> my propn , who knows ? <EOS>
<SOS> you heard her say it was n ’ t me . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , she said that . <EOS>
<SOS> i must go report what happened . <EOS>
<SOS> she was lying even as she was going down to hell . <EOS>
<SOS> i did kill her . <EOS>
<SOS> then she was even more an angel , and you ’ re an even blacker devil ! <EOS>
<SOS> she cheated on me , and she was a whore . <EOS>
<SOS> you slander her , you devil . <EOS>
<SOS> she was fickle and unfaithful , like water . <EOS>
<SOS> she was utterly true to you ! <EOS>
<SOS> ask your husband if you doubt me . <EOS>
<SOS> if i did n ’ t have a good reason to do this , damn me to the very bottom of hell . <EOS>
<SOS> your husband knew about everything . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband ! <EOS>
<SOS> your husband . <EOS>
<SOS> he said she was unfaithful ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> if she ’ d been faithful to me , i never would have given her up , not even if propn himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , he ’ s the one who first told me about her . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s an honest man who detests evil actions . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband ? <EOS>
<SOS> why do you keep repeating that , woman ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m telling you , your husband . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my mistress , a villain has made a mockery of your love ! <EOS>
<SOS> my husband said she was unfaithful ! <EOS>
<SOS> yes , him , woman . <EOS>
<SOS> i said “ your husband. ” —do you understand that word ? <EOS>
<SOS> my friend , your husband , the honest , honest iago . <EOS>
<SOS> if he said that , then i hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s lying through his teeth ! <EOS>
<SOS> she was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that ! <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> go ahead , do your worst . <EOS>
<SOS> you were n ’ t good enough for her . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ d better shut up ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you idiot ! <EOS>
<SOS> you stupid fool ! <EOS>
<SOS> as dumb as dirt ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll tell everyone what you did , even if it <EOS>
<SOS> the propn propn killed my mistress ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder , murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s going on here , general ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , are you here , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve done a good job , that other men can attribute their murders to you ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> i told him what i thought . <EOS>
<SOS> but did you tell him she cheated on him ? <EOS>
<SOS> i did . <EOS>
<SOS> then you told a lie , a sick , wicked lie . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear on my soul it was a lie . <EOS>
<SOS> you said she slept with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> did you say propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> now be quiet . <EOS>
<SOS> my mistress here lies murdered in her bed— no , propn forbid ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ca n ’ t trust them . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s true , they ’ re inconsistent . <EOS>
<SOS> my letters say there are a hundred and seven ships . <EOS>
<SOS> and mine say a hundred and forty . <EOS>
<SOS> and mine say two hundred . <EOS>
<SOS> but often in these cases , reports are just estimates . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , we get the idea . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a messenger from the warships . <EOS>
<SOS> and your lies caused this murder . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll kill myself out of grief ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , evil , evil ! <EOS>
<SOS> are you crazy ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m ordering you , go home . <EOS>
<SOS> good gentlemen , give me permission to speak . <EOS>
<SOS> i know i ought to obey my husband , but not now . <EOS>
<SOS> maybe i ’ ll never go home again , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> yes , go ahead and moan , because you killed the sweetest , most innocent woman who ever lived ! <EOS>
<SOS> she was filthy ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m glad your father is n ’ t alive to see this . <EOS>
<SOS> him terribly . <EOS>
<SOS> it would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s sad , but propn knows she had sex with propn a thousand times . <EOS>
<SOS> propn it , shut your mouth . <EOS>
<SOS> let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ re smart , you ’ ll go home . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> shame on you ! <EOS>
<SOS> drawing your sword on a woman ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you stupid propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> i found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ d begged me to steal it many times . <EOS>
<SOS> you evil whore ! <EOS>
<SOS> you think she gave it to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , i found it and gave it to my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> you piece of filth , you ’ re lying ! <EOS>
<SOS> i swear i ’ m not lying . <EOS>
<SOS> you absolute villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s killed his wife ! <EOS>
<SOS> yes , yes ! <EOS>
<SOS> lay me next to my mistress . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s gone , and his wife ’ s dead . <EOS>
<SOS> kill him rather than let him leave this room . <EOS>
<SOS> but why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did ? <EOS>
<SOS> let it all go . <EOS>
<SOS> what did your song mean , lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> can you hear me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll die like a swan . <EOS>
<SOS> they sing when they die . <EOS>
<SOS> here it is . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i ’ m coming out ! <EOS>
<SOS> look in on me , and talk with me , or i ’ ll attack even without a weapon . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> look , i have a weapon , the best sword a soldier could have . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon . <EOS>
<SOS> but <EOS>
<SOS> who can control his fate ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not like that now . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t be afraid , even though you see me with a weapon . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the end of my journey , the end of my life . <EOS>
<SOS> are you backing away in fear ? <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s no reason to be afraid . <EOS>
<SOS> where would propn go ? — oh , look at you ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re as pale as your nightgown ! <EOS>
<SOS> when we meet on propn propn , that look of yours will send me from propn to hell , where devils will grab me . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re cold , cold , and you were never hot with lust . <EOS>
<SOS> oh you damned villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> whip me , you devils , so i do n ’ t have to look at this heavenly sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> where is that poor rash man ? <EOS>
<SOS> you mean the man who used to be othello ? <EOS>
<SOS> here i am . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s that snake ? <EOS>
<SOS> bring the villain forward . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t like it that you knew about this , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn it , you ’ re not listening to me ! <EOS>
<SOS> you told me you hated him . <EOS>
<SOS> i do hate <EOS>
<SOS> but that ’ s just a fairy tale . <EOS>
<SOS> if you are a devil , i wo n ’ t be able to kill you . <EOS>
<SOS> take his sword away from him . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m bleeding , but you did n ’ t kill me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not sorry , either . <EOS>
<SOS> i want you to live , since to me , death is happiness . <EOS>
<SOS> say anything . <EOS>
<SOS> this poor guy ’ s partly confessed his plan . <EOS>
<SOS> did you plan propn ’ s death with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes . <EOS>
<SOS> dear general , i never gave you any reason to hate me . <EOS>
<SOS> i believe you , and i ask you to forgive me . <EOS>
<SOS> will you please make this half - devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul ? <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t ask me anything . <EOS>
<SOS> you know what you know . <EOS>
<SOS> from this moment on , i ’ ll never say another word . <EOS>
<SOS> what , not even to pray ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , do your best . <EOS>
<SOS> this one talks about how propn should kill propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn and monstrous ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you wicked scoundrel ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , how did you get my wife ’ s handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> i found it in my room , and propn just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re stripped of your power and your command , and propn will govern propn . <EOS>
<SOS> as for this slave , propn , if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time , he ’ ll have it . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the venetian government .— okay , take him away . <EOS>
<SOS> but enough about that . <EOS>
<SOS> when you record these sad events in your letters , please describe me exactly as i am . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ re being fair , you ’ ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much , but who was n ’ t wise about it . <EOS>
<SOS> write all this <EOS>
<SOS> down , and then say also that in propn i once saw a propn beating a propn , so i grabbed the propn by the throat and hit him like this . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , what a bloody end to all this ! <EOS>
<SOS> everything we ’ ve heard is bad . <EOS>
<SOS> i was afraid this would happen , because he was a noble , brave man , but i did n ’ t think he had a weapon . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think about this change ? <EOS>
<SOS> they ca n ’ t have changed ; there ’ s no way this could be true . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a trick to confuse us . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s some more news coming in . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s just what i thought . <EOS>
<SOS> how many , can you guess ? <EOS>
<SOS> thirty ships . <EOS>
<SOS> now they ’ ve turned around and are clearly heading for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , your brave and loyal servant , gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him . <EOS>
<SOS> then it ’ s certain they ’ re heading for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> is propn propn in town ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , he ’ s in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> write to him immediately . <EOS>
<SOS> hurry . <EOS>
<SOS> here come propn and the brave propn . <EOS>
<SOS> forgive me , your grace . <EOS>
<SOS> why , what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s my daughter ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my daughter ! <EOS>
<SOS> is she dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s dead to me . <EOS>
<SOS> and you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit , and impose the death penalty if you choose to , even if the criminal were my own son . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly thank you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ re sorry to hear this . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , but this is true . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s nothing more . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m awkward in my speech and i ’ m not a smooth talker . <EOS>
<SOS> she blushes at the slightest thing . <EOS>
<SOS> the devil must be behind this . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore i say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her . <EOS>
<SOS> tell us , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> or did you agree to this as equals ? <EOS>
<SOS> of her father . <EOS>
<SOS> bring propn here . <EOS>
<SOS> you know where she is . <EOS>
<SOS> in the meantime i ’ ll tell you all , as honestly as i confess my sins to propn , how i wooed this beautiful lady , and how she came to love me . <EOS>
<SOS> tell us , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often , continually asking me about my life and all the battles i ’ ve fought . <EOS>
<SOS> when i talked about all these things , propn used to listen attentively . <EOS>
<SOS> she said she wished she had n ’ t heard it , but she also wished there was a man like me for her . <EOS>
<SOS> she thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell , she ’ d fall in love with him . <EOS>
<SOS> i took the hint and spoke to her . <EOS>
<SOS> she said she loved me for the dangers i ’ d survived , and i loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s the only witchcraft i ever used . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes my wife now . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ ll confirm everything . <EOS>
<SOS> i think a story like that would win my own daughter over . <EOS>
<SOS> please let her speak . <EOS>
<SOS> if she admits she wanted this , then i wo n ’ t blame propn .— come here , my child . <EOS>
<SOS> who do you obey here ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , this is n ’ t easy for me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m torn . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re the one i have to obey . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m your daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m finished , then . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , please go ahead with your state business . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather adopt a child than have one of my own .— come here , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> with all my heart , i give you that thing which , if you did n ’ t already have it , i ’ d try with all my heart to keep from you . <EOS>
<SOS> you would have made me treat them like a tyrant .— propn done , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers : if you ca n ’ t change something , do n ’ t cry about it . <EOS>
<SOS> please , i ’ m asking you , go ahead and get back to your state affairs . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn are heading for propn with a powerful fleet . <EOS>
<SOS> she can stay at her father ’ s house . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t allow it . <EOS>
<SOS> neither will i . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , please listen to what i have to say . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you want to do , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> when i fell in love with othello i made up my mind that i wanted to live with him . <EOS>
<SOS> i saw propn ’ s true face when i saw his mind . <EOS>
<SOS> let me go with him . <EOS>
<SOS> please allow her to do this . <EOS>
<SOS> you can decide that privately . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s important is the urgency of this mission . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll have to leave tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> with all my heart , i ’ ll go right away . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll meet again at nine in the morning . <EOS>
<SOS> othello , have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ ll accompany my wife , and bring whatever else you think i might need . <EOS>
<SOS> which any peace - lover can do . <EOS>
<SOS> his military understanding is all theory , no practice . <EOS>
<SOS> and there ’ s nothing i can do about it . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s the curse of military service . <EOS>
<SOS> now , you tell me : should i feel loyal to the propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> if you do n ’ t like him you should quit . <EOS>
<SOS> no , calm down . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m serving under him to take advantage of him . <EOS>
<SOS> we ca n ’ t all be masters , and not all masters should be followed . <EOS>
<SOS> look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food , and then when they get old they ’ re terminated . <EOS>
<SOS> they ought to be whipped for being so stupid . <EOS>
<SOS> let me tell <EOS>
<SOS> all right , then . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn well . <EOS>
<SOS> keep an eye on her , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> she lied to me , and she may lie to you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i ’ m leaving my dear propn with you . <EOS>
<SOS> have your wife attend to her , and bring them along as soon as you can . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , propn , i ’ ve only got an hour of love to spend with you , to tell you what you need to do . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ re on a tight schedule . <EOS>
<SOS> iago . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you have to say , noble friend ? <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think i should do ? <EOS>
<SOS> go to bed , and sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m going to go drown myself . <EOS>
<SOS> if you do that , i ’ ll never respect you again . <EOS>
<SOS> why , you silly man ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , how stupid ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve been alive for twenty - eight years , and i ’ ve never met a man who knew what was good for him . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman i ca n ’ t have . <EOS>
<SOS> what should i do ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know it ’ s foolish to be so much in love , but i ca n ’ t help it . <EOS>
<SOS> ca n ’ t help it ? <EOS>
<SOS> nonsense ! <EOS>
<SOS> what we are is up to us . <EOS>
<SOS> our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener . <EOS>
<SOS> depending on what we plant — weeds or lettuce , or one kind of herb rather than a variety , the garden will either be barren and useless , or rich and productive . <EOS>
<SOS> if we did n ’ t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires , our bodily urges would take over . <EOS>
<SOS> thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t believe it . <EOS>
<SOS> you feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , be a man . <EOS>
<SOS> drown yourself ? <EOS>
<SOS> drowning is for cats or blind puppies — don ’ t drown yourself ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve told you i ’ m your friend , and i ’ ll stick by you . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve never been more useful to you than i will be now . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s what you ’ ll do . <EOS>
<SOS> moors are moody people .— so sell your lands and raise a lot of cash . <EOS>
<SOS> what seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ ll have to have it . <EOS>
<SOS> so have your money ready . <EOS>
<SOS> if you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> raise all the money you can . <EOS>
<SOS> i can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved venetian girl . <EOS>
<SOS> and to hell with drowning yourself ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s completely beside the point . <EOS>
<SOS> you can trust me . <EOS>
<SOS> go now and get cash . <EOS>
<SOS> i told you before , and i ’ ll tell you again and again : i hate the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> so let ’ s join forces and get revenge . <EOS>
<SOS> go get money . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll speak again tomorrow . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> where will we meet in the morning ? <EOS>
<SOS> at my house . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be there early . <EOS>
<SOS> no more talk about killing yourself , okay ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve changed my mind about that . <EOS>
<SOS> go then , goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> put a lot of cash together . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m going to sell all my land . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s how i always do it , getting money from fools . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if i could n ’ t get something useful out of him . <EOS>
<SOS> i hate the propn , and there ’ s a widespread rumor that he ’ s slept with my wife . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not sure it ’ s true , but just the suspicion is enough for me . <EOS>
<SOS> he thinks highly of me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn a handsome man . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s see , how can i <EOS>
<SOS> get his position and use him to hurt propn at the same time ? <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s see . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve worked it out . <EOS>
<SOS> what can you see out on the ocean ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> it was windy on shore too . <EOS>
<SOS> a big blast of wind shook our fortifications . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think will be the result of this storm ? <EOS>
<SOS> the turkish navy will be broken up . <EOS>
<SOS> the wind ’ s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve never seen the waters so disturbed . <EOS>
<SOS> if the turkish fleet is n ’ t protected in some harbor , their men must all be drowned . <EOS>
<SOS> no ship could survive this storm . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve got news , boys , the war ’ s over ! <EOS>
<SOS> this terrible storm has smashed the propn so badly that their plans are ruined . <EOS>
<SOS> one of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked . <EOS>
<SOS> what ? <EOS>
<SOS> is this true ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , lieutenant of the propn propn , has arrived on shore . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn himself is still at sea . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m happy about that . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ ll be a good governor . <EOS>
<SOS> the two of them were separated during the storm . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope to propn propn propn all right . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s do that . <EOS>
<SOS> every minute we expect more ships to arrive . <EOS>
<SOS> thanks , you brave men who defend this island and respect othello . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope propn protects him from the weather , because i lost sight of him on the stormy sea . <EOS>
<SOS> is his ship sturdy ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , it ’ s well built , and the ship ’ s pilot is very expert and experienced . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s all that shouting about ? <EOS>
<SOS> please go find out for certain who has arrived . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do that . <EOS>
<SOS> good lieutenant , is your general married ? <EOS>
<SOS> a man named propn , the general ’ s ensign . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s that ? <EOS>
<SOS> look , the precious propn has arrived on shore . <EOS>
<SOS> we should all kneel before her , men of propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> greetings , my lady , and may propn always be with you . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you , brave propn . <EOS>
<SOS> is there any news about my husband ? <EOS>
<SOS> he has n ’ t arrived yet . <EOS>
<SOS> as far as i know , he ’ s okay and will arrive here soon . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , but i ’ m worried . <EOS>
<SOS> how did you two get separated ? <EOS>
<SOS> the storm separated us . <EOS>
<SOS> go find out the news . <EOS>
<SOS> you , as sure as your name ’ s propn , if i were the propn i would n ’ t want to be propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not who i appear to be . <EOS>
<SOS> do it , and shout like the city ’ s on fire . <EOS>
<SOS> hey , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , hey ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> check on your daughter , your house , your money ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> if she gave you as much lip as she gives me , you ’ d be sick of her by now . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s always talking when i want to sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> i admit that in front of you , my lady , she keeps a bit quiet . <EOS>
<SOS> you have no reason to say that . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , come on . <EOS>
<SOS> in your own kitchens you act like wildcats . <EOS>
<SOS> shame on you , you slanderer ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , it ’ s true , or if it ’ s not , i ’ m a villain . <EOS>
<SOS> you wake up to have fun , and you start work when you go to bed . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i do n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> but if you had to say something nice about me , what would you say ? <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t make me do it , my lady . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m critical by nature . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not as happy as i seem . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , what would you say about me ? <EOS>
<SOS> very clever ! <EOS>
<SOS> even if she ’ s ugly , she ’ ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her . <EOS>
<SOS> this is getting worse and worse ! <EOS>
<SOS> what if she ’ s pretty but stupid ? <EOS>
<SOS> you do n ’ t know a thing ! <EOS>
<SOS> you give your best praise to the worst women . <EOS>
<SOS> but how would you praise a truly good woman , someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her ? <EOS>
<SOS> a woman who was beautiful but never proud , who could speak well but knew when to be quiet , who dressed well but was never overdressed , who had self - restraint even when she could get what she wanted , a woman who never took revenge , who overlooked it when people hurt her , who was too wise to do anything stupid , who could think without revealing her thoughts , and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her , that kind of woman , if she ever existed , would— would do what ? <EOS>
<SOS> would raise babies and clip coupons . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , that ’ s pathetic ! <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t listen to him , propn , even though he ’ s your husband . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think about him , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> is n ’ t he a horrible man ? <EOS>
<SOS> he speaks bluntly , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s more of a soldier than a wise man . <EOS>
<SOS> i recognize his trumpet . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , it is . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s go greet him when he lands . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here he comes . <EOS>
<SOS> my beautiful warrior ! <EOS>
<SOS> my darling othello ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m amazed you got here before me . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ m overjoyed ! <EOS>
<SOS> if i died right now i ’ d be completely happy , since i ’ ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life . <EOS>
<SOS> propn willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older . <EOS>
<SOS> amen to that ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t talk about my happiness anymore . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s too much . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s go up to the castle . <EOS>
<SOS> good news , friends . <EOS>
<SOS> the war ’ s over and the propn are drowned . <EOS>
<SOS> how are my old friends from this island doing ? — propn , they ’ ll love you here in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> and bring the ship ’ s captain to the castle . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s a good man .— let ’ s go , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> meet me down at the harbor .— come here . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn will be on guard duty tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> but first , i have to tell you that propn ’ s completely in love with him . <EOS>
<SOS> with propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s impossible . <EOS>
<SOS> be quiet and listen to me . <EOS>
<SOS> othello is n ’ t any of those things . <EOS>
<SOS> now , if that ’ s true — and it ’ s obviously true — who ’ s in a better position than propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> besides , he ’ s young and handsome , and he ’ s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t believe that . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s very moral . <EOS>
<SOS> like hell she is ! <EOS>
<SOS> if she were so moral , she would never have fallen in love with the propn in the first place . <EOS>
<SOS> good lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> did you see that ? <EOS>
<SOS> they were lusting after each other . <EOS>
<SOS> disgusting ! <EOS>
<SOS> but listen to me ; let me guide you . <EOS>
<SOS> i brought you here from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> be on guard duty tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> propn does n ’ t know you . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be nearby . <EOS>
<SOS> make propn angry somehow , either by speaking too loud , or insulting his military skills , or however else you want . <EOS>
<SOS> all right . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s hot - tempered , and he might try to hit you with his staff . <EOS>
<SOS> try to get him to do that . <EOS>
<SOS> to get what you want , you need to get propn out of the way . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do it , if you help me out . <EOS>
<SOS> i promise i will . <EOS>
<SOS> meet me in a little while at the citadel . <EOS>
<SOS> i need to get propn ’ s things from the ship . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t be satisfied until i get even with him , wife for wife . <EOS>
<SOS> if i ca n ’ t do that , i can at least make the propn so jealous that he ca n ’ t think straight . <EOS>
<SOS> for besides the good news , we are also celebrating his marriage . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s the end of the announcement . <EOS>
<SOS> there will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven . <EOS>
<SOS> propn bless the island of propn and our noble general othello ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s a good man . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can .— come with me , my dear love . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , everyone . <EOS>
<SOS> hello , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s time for us to stand guard . <EOS>
<SOS> the general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with propn .— i ca n ’ t blame him . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the reason for this horrible shouting ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , is everyone in your family at home ? <EOS>
<SOS> are your doors locked ? <EOS>
<SOS> why are you asking me that ? <EOS>
<SOS> for propn ’ s sake , sir , you ’ ve been robbed . <EOS>
<SOS> your heart ’ s going to break . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s like half your soul ’ s been ripped out . <EOS>
<SOS> at this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb . <EOS>
<SOS> wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens . <EOS>
<SOS> get up , i tell you ! <EOS>
<SOS> are you crazy ? <EOS>
<SOS> do you recognize my voice , noble lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> not me . <EOS>
<SOS> who are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> my name ’ s propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i told you not to hang around my house . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , sir— <EOS>
<SOS> yes , she ’ s young and tender . <EOS>
<SOS> like an invitation . <EOS>
<SOS> but she ’ s modest and ladylike too . <EOS>
<SOS> and when she speaks , does n ’ t her voice stir up passion ? <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s a perfect woman , it ’ s true . <EOS>
<SOS> well , good luck to them tonight in bed ! <EOS>
<SOS> not tonight , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not much of a drinker . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish there was less social pressure to drink . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , but these are our friends . <EOS>
<SOS> just one glass . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do most of the drinking for you . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve already had a glass of wine tonight , watered down , but look how drunk i am . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you talking about , man ? <EOS>
<SOS> tonight is for celebrating ! <EOS>
<SOS> where are they ? <EOS>
<SOS> by the door . <EOS>
<SOS> please invite them in . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do it , but i do n ’ t like it . <EOS>
<SOS> if i can just get him to drink one more glass after what he ’ s drunk already , he ’ ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog . <EOS>
<SOS> now i ’ ll get propn to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island . <EOS>
<SOS> here they come . <EOS>
<SOS> if the future turns out as i hope it will , i ’ m all set for success . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn , they ’ ve given me a lot to drink . <EOS>
<SOS> no , it was a little one , not more than a pint . <EOS>
<SOS> bring in more wine ! <EOS>
<SOS> my propn , what a great song ! <EOS>
<SOS> i learned it in propn , where they have a talent for drinking . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn , the propn , and the propn — come on , drink , drink ! —are nothing compared to the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> are propn really such heavy drinkers ? <EOS>
<SOS> they drink danes under the table , and it takes them no effort at all to out - drink germans . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s drink to our general ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll drink as much as you do ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , sweet propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , that song ’ s even better than the other one . <EOS>
<SOS> do you want to hear it again ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , because we should n ’ t be doing that — stuff . <EOS>
<SOS> oh well , propn ’ s in charge , and some people have to go to propn , while other people have to go to hell . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s true , lieutenant . <EOS>
<SOS> speaking for myself — and no offense to the general or anyone else — i hope i ’ m going to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> me too , lieutenant . <EOS>
<SOS> okay , but please not before me . <EOS>
<SOS> the lieutenant has to get to propn before the ensign . <EOS>
<SOS> but let ’ s stop this drinking and get down to business .— propn forgive our sins ! —gentlemen , let ’ s get down to business . <EOS>
<SOS> by the way , i do n ’ t want anyone thinking i ’ m drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> i can stand well enough , and i can speak just fine . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , you ’ re speaking very well . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , very well . <EOS>
<SOS> so do n ’ t think that i ’ m drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s too bad . <EOS>
<SOS> but is he often like this ? <EOS>
<SOS> he drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ d stay up all night and all day if he did n ’ t drink himself to sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> the general should be informed about this . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t you think so ? <EOS>
<SOS> and it ’ s too bad that the propn chose a man with such a deep - rooted drinking problem as his second - in - command . <EOS>
<SOS> we should definitely say something to the propn . <EOS>
