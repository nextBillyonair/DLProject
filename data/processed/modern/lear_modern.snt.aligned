<SOS> you have weapons ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s going on here ? <EOS>
<SOS> stop it , i order you . <EOS>
<SOS> the next person to strike again dies . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s going on here ? <EOS>
<SOS> these are the messengers from my sister and the king . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you fighting about ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m out of breath , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> a tailor made you . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s an odd thing to say . <EOS>
<SOS> how can a tailor make a person ? <EOS>
<SOS> definitely a tailor , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> a sculptor or a painter could n ’ t have screwed him up as bad as that , even as an apprentice . <EOS>
<SOS> but tell me what you ’ re fighting about . <EOS>
<SOS> calm down . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t you have any manners , you savage ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , sir , but not when i ’ m enraged . <EOS>
<SOS> why are you enraged ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you laughing at what i say , as if i were a fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you insane , old man ? <EOS>
<SOS> why are you calling him a jerk ? <EOS>
<SOS> what did he do to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t like his face . <EOS>
<SOS> but maybe you do n ’ t like mine , or his , or hers either . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a guy who ’ s been praised for his honest bluntness , and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words . <EOS>
<SOS> no flattery for him , no sir ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s honest , he ’ s got to speak the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> if people take what he says , fine . <EOS>
<SOS> if not , he ’ s got truth on his side ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , kindest , most honorable sir , may i say , with your esteemed approval , which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun - god phoebus , propn what do you mean by that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i tried to stop speaking plainly , since you dislike plain speech so much . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i know i ’ m not a flatterer . <EOS>
<SOS> i never offended him at all . <EOS>
<SOS> these cowards manage to make fools of brave men . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t put me in the stocks . <EOS>
<SOS> i serve the king , who sent me here . <EOS>
<SOS> if you put me in the stocks you ’ ll insult him both as a king and as a man . <EOS>
<SOS> bring out the stocks ! <EOS>
<SOS> i swear on my life and honor , he ’ ll sit here in the stocks until noon . <EOS>
<SOS> only until noon , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , the whole day , and all night too . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you would n ’ t treat me like this if i were your father ’ s dog . <EOS>
<SOS> but since you ’ re his scoundrel servant , i will . <EOS>
<SOS> this guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about .— come on , bring in the stocks , now ! <EOS>
<SOS> i beg you not to do this , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s done wrong , and his master the king will punish him for it . <EOS>
<SOS> the king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll take responsibility for that . <EOS>
<SOS> my sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders .— put his legs in the stocks . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sorry , my friend . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll try talking to him again . <EOS>
<SOS> please do n ’ t , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> even good men have bad luck . <EOS>
<SOS> have a good morning . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s wrong for the duke to do this . <EOS>
<SOS> the king will be angry with him . <EOS>
<SOS> honor you . <EOS>
<SOS> hopefully when i get married , i ’ ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sure i ’ ll never get married in the way my sisters say they ’ re married , loving their father only . <EOS>
<SOS> but do you mean what you ’ re saying ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> so young and so cruel ? <EOS>
<SOS> so young , my lord , and honest . <EOS>
<SOS> then that ’ s the way it ’ ll be . <EOS>
<SOS> the truth will be all the inheritance you get . <EOS>
<SOS> foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you , ex - daughter of mine . <EOS>
<SOS> but sir— be quiet , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree . <EOS>
<SOS> every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout , waiting to capture me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll smear my face with filth , put on a loincloth , make my hair matted and tangled , and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> well , at least that ’ s something . <EOS>
<SOS> as propn , i ’ m nothing at all . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s strange that propn and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger . <EOS>
<SOS> according to what i heard , they had no travel plans as of last night . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s this ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s a nasty garter belt . <EOS>
<SOS> you tie up horses by their heads , dogs and bears by their necks , monkeys by their waists , and humans by their legs . <EOS>
<SOS> your daughter and son - in - law . <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> yes . <EOS>
<SOS> no , no , they would n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , they have . <EOS>
<SOS> by the god propn above , i swear “ no . ” by propn ’ s wife propn , i swear “ yes . ” they would n ’ t dare . <EOS>
<SOS> they could n ’ t , they would n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s worse than murder to humiliate a king ’ s messenger like this . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , when i arrived at their home i gave them your letter . <EOS>
<SOS> he woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s why your daughter and son - in - law are punishing me shamefully . <EOS>
<SOS> fathers who wear rags make their children neglect them . <EOS>
<SOS> but fathers who are rich make their children kind . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn is a fickle whore and never gives the poor a break . <EOS>
<SOS> but despite all this , your daughters will give you a lot of money — or do i mean pain ? — in the coming year . <EOS>
<SOS> i feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> inside , sir , with the earl . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t follow me . <EOS>
<SOS> stay here . <EOS>
<SOS> you did n ’ t do anything else to earn this punishment ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> tell me , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ? <EOS>
<SOS> if they ’ d put you in the stocks for asking that question , you would ’ ve deserved it . <EOS>
<SOS> why , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> you need to learn what ants know well about winter — there ’ s no point in slaving away if there ’ s no hope for profit . <EOS>
<SOS> everyone can see that , and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now . <EOS>
<SOS> when you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill , you should n ’ t try to hold on to it or it ’ ll break your neck . <EOS>
<SOS> but if you see a wheel going uphill , latch on for the ride . <EOS>
<SOS> and when a wise man gives you better advice than i just did , give me my advice back again . <EOS>
<SOS> i only want idiots following my advice , the advice of a fool . <EOS>
<SOS> the gentleman who serves you only for profit and is only superficially loyal to you will take off when it starts to rain and leave you alone in the storm . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll linger . <EOS>
<SOS> the fool will stay . <EOS>
<SOS> and let the wise man run away . <EOS>
<SOS> where did you learn that song , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> not in the stocks , fool . <EOS>
<SOS> how can they refuse to speak with me ? <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ re playing with me . <EOS>
<SOS> these are tricks . <EOS>
<SOS> this is rebellion . <EOS>
<SOS> my dear lord , you know how passionately stubborn the duke is . <EOS>
<SOS> propn it all to hell ! <EOS>
<SOS> passionately ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> what “ passion ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn , i want to speak with the propn of propn and his wife . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i informed them as much . <EOS>
<SOS> informed them ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> do you understand what i ’ m saying , man ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> the king wants to speak with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> did you inform them of that ? <EOS>
<SOS> this is unbelievable ! <EOS>
<SOS> passionate ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> the “ passionate ” duke ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell the hot - headed duke that i … but no , not yet . <EOS>
<SOS> maybe he ’ s not feeling well . <EOS>
<SOS> i just want everything to be all right between you . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my heart , my heart is rising into my throat ! <EOS>
<SOS> stay down , heart . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s right , uncle , talk to your heart , like the good morning to you both . <EOS>
<SOS> hail to your majesty . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m glad to see your highness . <EOS>
<SOS> i believe you are , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you know why i think so ? <EOS>
<SOS> my dear propn , your sister ’ s not worth anything . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , she ’ s torn me apart with unkindness , like a vulture , right here . <EOS>
<SOS> calm down , sir , please . <EOS>
<SOS> how do you mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way . <EOS>
<SOS> if she restrained your rowdy knights , she had such a good reason that you ca n ’ t blame her for it . <EOS>
<SOS> i curse her . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you ’ re old . <EOS>
<SOS> your life is stretched to its limit . <EOS>
<SOS> you should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what ’ s good for you . <EOS>
<SOS> please go back to propn ’ s house . <EOS>
<SOS> admit you were wrong . <EOS>
<SOS> apologize ? <EOS>
<SOS> no more , please . <EOS>
<SOS> these are ugly antics . <EOS>
<SOS> go back to my sister propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , please ! <EOS>
<SOS> i hope lightning strikes her in the eyes ! <EOS>
<SOS> i hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , dear gods ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s how you ’ ll talk about me when you ’ re in this mood . <EOS>
<SOS> her eyes are vicious , but yours are comforting . <EOS>
<SOS> you have n ’ t forgotten the half of a kingdom i gave you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , let ’ s get to the point . <EOS>
<SOS> get out of my sight ! —i guess if she does n ’ t love her father , then i ’ ll only have peace when i ’ m dead .— call the propn of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> call the propn of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> if she wants to be proud , or “ honest , ” as she calls it , she can just marry her own pride . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , i ’ ve always honored you as king , loved you as my father , obeyed you as my master , and thanked you in my prayers— i ’ m furious and ready to snap . <EOS>
<SOS> let your anger fall on me then , even if its sharpness pierces my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> propn can speak rudely when propn goes mad . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you doing , old man ? <EOS>
<SOS> when powerful kings cave in to flatterers , do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it ? <EOS>
<SOS> when a majestic king starts acting silly , then it ’ s my duty to be blunt . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s that trumpet ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know it . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ ll be here soon , just like her letter said . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for .— get out of my sight , scoundrel ! <EOS>
<SOS> what do you mean , your highness ? <EOS>
<SOS> who put my servant in the stocks ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i hope you did n ’ t know anything about that .— ah , who ’ s this ? <EOS>
<SOS> why should n ’ t she take my hand , father ? <EOS>
<SOS> how exactly have i offended you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i sent him there , sir , but his crimes deserved a worse punishment . <EOS>
<SOS> you ! <EOS>
<SOS> you did it ? <EOS>
<SOS> please , father , since you ’ re weak , act like it . <EOS>
<SOS> get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister . <EOS>
<SOS> right now i ’ m away from home and i ca n ’ t provide you with proper care . <EOS>
<SOS> go back with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> go back with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> i might as well go before the propn of propn , who took my youngest daughter without a dowry , kneel before his throne , and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive . <EOS>
<SOS> go back with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here . <EOS>
<SOS> as you wish , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i beg you , daughter , do n ’ t make me crazy . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t bother you . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll never see each other again . <EOS>
<SOS> but you ’ re still my child , my flesh and blood — or rather you ’ re a disease in my flesh , a disease i still have to call my own . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a pustule , a sore , a tumor digesting my bloodline . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll stop rebuking you . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t beg the gods to punish you , or caution you to fear their judgment . <EOS>
<SOS> become a better <EOS>
<SOS> person when you ’ re ready , if you ’ re inclined . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll wait patiently . <EOS>
<SOS> meanwhile i ’ ll stay with propn with my hundred knights . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s not quite that simple . <EOS>
<SOS> i was n ’ t expecting you , and i ’ m not ready to receive you . <EOS>
<SOS> please hear what propn is saying . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ re trying to be reasonable while you ’ re so upset , and we understand that you ’ re old , and … but propn knows what she ’ s doing . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i do . <EOS>
<SOS> how could so many people , under two masters , get along under one roof ? <EOS>
<SOS> it would be hard , almost impossible . <EOS>
<SOS> why could n ’ t you be attended by my servants , or by propn propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , why not , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> then if they ’ re negligent , we could control them . <EOS>
<SOS> now that i think about the danger of these knights , if you come to stay with me , please bring no more than twenty - five of them with you . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t lodge any more than that under my roof . <EOS>
<SOS> i gave you everything— and it was about time too . <EOS>
<SOS> i made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that i could keep a hundred knights of my own . <EOS>
<SOS> why should i now have to make do with only twenty - five ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , is that what you said ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i ’ ll say it again , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> no more than twenty - five . <EOS>
<SOS> not being the worst daughter deserves some praise , i guess . <EOS>
<SOS> hear me out , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> why do you need twenty - five knights , or ten , or even five , when you ’ re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service ? <EOS>
<SOS> why do you need even one ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , do n ’ t ask me why i “ need ” them ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a well - dressed lady . <EOS>
<SOS> if you dressed only to stay warm , you would n ’ t need these gorgeous clothes you ’ re wearing — which do n ’ t keep you warm at all . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , gods , give me patience ! <EOS>
<SOS> you see me here , gods , a grieving old man , as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ re the ones setting my daughters against me , do n ’ t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down . <EOS>
<SOS> man ’ s cheeks . <EOS>
<SOS> no , you monstrous hags , i ’ ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world … i will do such things — i do n ’ t know what i ’ ll do exactly , but it ’ ll be devastating . <EOS>
<SOS> you expect me to cry ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , i wo n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> i have a good reason to cry , but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before i let myself cry .— oh , propn , i ’ ll go mad ! <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s go inside . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s going to be a storm . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a small house . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s no room for the old man and his followers . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s his fault that he ’ s all worked up like this . <EOS>
<SOS> he has to pay the price for his foolish actions . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s what i intend to do too . <EOS>
<SOS> where is propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> he followed the old man . <EOS>
<SOS> here he comes back . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s he going ? <EOS>
<SOS> he has called for his horse , but i do n ’ t know where he ’ s headed . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s best just to let him go . <EOS>
<SOS> he wo n ’ t listen to anyone ’ s advice . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s hardly a bush for miles around . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , sir , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions . <EOS>
<SOS> lock the doors . <EOS>
<SOS> his attendants are desperate , violent men . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m afraid of what they might encourage him to do , considering the state he ’ s in . <EOS>
<SOS> lock the doors , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a wild night . <EOS>
<SOS> propn gives good advice . <EOS>
<SOS> come in out of the storm . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there , aside from this foul weather ? <EOS>
<SOS> someone whose mood is as foul as the weather , very troubled . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> struggling with the wind and rain . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea , or make the sea flood the earth — he wants to see the world return to primal chaos . <EOS>
<SOS> he keeps tearing out his white hair , which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness . <EOS>
<SOS> small but brave in his surroundings , he ’ s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s running bareheaded , calling for the end of the world , out there on a night like this , when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide . <EOS>
<SOS> but who ’ s with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> nobody but the fool , who ’ s trying to soothe the wounds in the king ’ s heart with jokes . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i know you , and i trust you enough to share something very important with you . <EOS>
<SOS> some french agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war . <EOS>
<SOS> now this is where you come in . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m a nobleman , and i know what i ’ m doing in assigning this job to you . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s discuss it some more . <EOS>
<SOS> let me shake your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> do you have anything else to tell me ? <EOS>
<SOS> rage on , blow ! <EOS>
<SOS> let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned . <EOS>
<SOS> let quick sulfurous lightning , strong enough to split enormous trees , singe the white hair on my head . <EOS>
<SOS> let thunder flatten the spherical world , crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings , and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , uncle , it ’ s better to smile and flatter indoors where it ’ s dry than get soaked out here . <EOS>
<SOS> please , uncle , let ’ s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you . <EOS>
<SOS> this storm has no pity for either wise men or fools . <EOS>
<SOS> let thunder rumble ! <EOS>
<SOS> let lightning spit fire ! <EOS>
<SOS> let the rain spray ! <EOS>
<SOS> the rain , the wind , the thunder and lightning are not my daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> nature , i do n ’ t accuse your weather of unkindness . <EOS>
<SOS> so go ahead and have your terrifying fun . <EOS>
<SOS> here i am , your slave — a poor , sick , weak , hated old man . <EOS>
<SOS> anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders . <EOS>
<SOS> on my life i swear to you that your youngest daughter does n ’ t love you least . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , if you want to stay alive , stop talking . <EOS>
<SOS> get out of my sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> learn to see better , propn , and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice . <EOS>
<SOS> now , i swear by propn … by propn , propn , you ’ re taking the names of the gods in vain . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you lowlife ! <EOS>
<SOS> scum ! <EOS>
<SOS> please stop , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> listen to me , you traitor . <EOS>
<SOS> for there never was a pretty woman who did n ’ t like to preen in the mirror . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i ’ ll be patient . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t say a word . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> a wise man and a fool . <EOS>
<SOS> let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light . <EOS>
<SOS> it will give you some protection from this storm . <EOS>
<SOS> they are harder than the stones the house is made of . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m starting to lose my mind . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s true , my good boy .— come on , take us to that hut . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll recite a prophecy before i go . <EOS>
<SOS> and whoever lives to see that day will walk with his feet . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the prophecy that the wizard <EOS>
<SOS> oh , oh , propn , i do n ’ t like this monstrous business . <EOS>
<SOS> when asked the propn and propn of propn if i could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm , they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him , lobby for him , or support him in any way . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s uncivilized and unnatural ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , be quiet . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a feud between the two dukes . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s dangerous to talk about it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve locked it up in my room . <EOS>
<SOS> the humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly . <EOS>
<SOS> armed forces have already landed . <EOS>
<SOS> we have to take the king ’ s side . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll look for him and secretly help him . <EOS>
<SOS> you go and talk to the duke so he wo n ’ t notice i ’ m helping the king . <EOS>
<SOS> if he asks to see me , tell him i ’ m sick and went to bed . <EOS>
<SOS> even if i have to die — as they threaten — i have to help the king . <EOS>
<SOS> strange things are about to happen , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> please be careful . <EOS>
<SOS> and i ’ ll tell him about the letter too . <EOS>
<SOS> the young generation rises while the old one falls . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s the hut , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> please go inside . <EOS>
<SOS> the night ’ s too rough for humans to bear . <EOS>
<SOS> leave me for a bit . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , here is the entrance . <EOS>
<SOS> will you break my heart ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather break my own heart . <EOS>
<SOS> now please go in . <EOS>
<SOS> you think it ’ s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a big deal to you . <EOS>
<SOS> but whenever you feel a larger pain , the smaller one disappears . <EOS>
<SOS> you would run away from a bear , but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean , you ’ d turn around and confront the bear . <EOS>
<SOS> when your mind is at peace , your body is sensitive to the elements . <EOS>
<SOS> but this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what ’ s tormenting me — how ungrateful my children are ! <EOS>
<SOS> is n ’ t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it ? <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll punish them thoroughly . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i wo n ’ t cry any more . <EOS>
<SOS> imagine them locking me out on a night like this ! <EOS>
<SOS> but let it rain ; i ’ ll survive . <EOS>
<SOS> on a night like this ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , propn , your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything — oh , if i think about that i ’ ll go mad . <EOS>
<SOS> i want to avoid that . <EOS>
<SOS> no more of these thoughts . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , please go inside here . <EOS>
<SOS> go inside yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> make yourself comfortable . <EOS>
<SOS> this storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll go in . <EOS>
<SOS> go out and feel what the impoverished feel . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t come in here , uncle ! <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a spirit in here ! <EOS>
<SOS> help me , help me ! <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> a ghost , a ghost ! <EOS>
<SOS> he says his name propn propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> who are you , moaning in the hut like that ? <EOS>
<SOS> come out . <EOS>
<SOS> go away ! <EOS>
<SOS> the devil propn after me ! <EOS>
<SOS> the cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up . <EOS>
<SOS> did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this ? <EOS>
<SOS> bless your five senses ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s chilly . <EOS>
<SOS> oh do - de , do - de , do - de . <EOS>
<SOS> propn protect you from tornadoes , evil stars , and diseases ! <EOS>
<SOS> take pity on propn propn , who is persecuted by the devil . <EOS>
<SOS> there ! … and over there ! … and over there ! <EOS>
<SOS> have his daughters made him crazy like this ? — couldn ’ t you have kept something for yourself ? <EOS>
<SOS> did you have to give them everything ? <EOS>
<SOS> if he had n ’ t , we ’ d all be embarrassed to look at him . <EOS>
<SOS> then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners ! <EOS>
<SOS> he does n ’ t have any daughters , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> like hell ! <EOS>
<SOS> nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this . <EOS>
<SOS> is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> this stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen . <EOS>
<SOS> beware of the devil . <EOS>
<SOS> obey your parents , keep your word , do n ’ t swear , do n ’ t sleep with another man ’ s wife , and do n ’ t covet flashy clothes . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s chilly . <EOS>
<SOS> what were you before this ? <EOS>
<SOS> i loved wine and gambling , and had more women than a turkish sultan keeps in his harem . <EOS>
<SOS> the cold wind propn still blowing through the hawthorn tree . <EOS>
<SOS> look at him . <EOS>
<SOS> the human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor , naked , two - legged animal like you . <EOS>
<SOS> let me unbutton this . <EOS>
<SOS> please calm down , uncle . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a nasty night to go swimming . <EOS>
<SOS> on a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man — a tiny spark in a cold body . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here comes a walking fire . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn . <EOS>
<SOS> and go away , witch , go away . <EOS>
<SOS> how are you , your highness ? <EOS>
<SOS> who are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> what do you want ? <EOS>
<SOS> who are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> what are your names ? <EOS>
<SOS> calm down , propn , you fiend ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s called propn and propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn ’ s chilly . <EOS>
<SOS> come back to my house with me . <EOS>
<SOS> i could n ’ t bear to obey all of your daughters ' harsh orders . <EOS>
<SOS> they commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm , but i ’ ve come out here to find you and take you where there ’ s warmth and food . <EOS>
<SOS> first let me talk with this philosopher here.— <EOS>
<SOS> now get out of here ! <EOS>
<SOS> i swear by propn i ’ ll never revoke this punishment . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here are the rulers of propn and propn , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord the ruler of propn , i ’ ll speak to you first . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve been competing with this king for my daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> let me ask you something in private . <EOS>
<SOS> can you blame him ? <EOS>
<SOS> his daughters want to kill him . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , good old propn said this would happen — that poor , banished man . <EOS>
<SOS> you say the king is losing his mind . <EOS>
<SOS> let me tell you , my friend , i ’ m almost insane myself . <EOS>
<SOS> i had a son , whom i ’ ve legally disowned . <EOS>
<SOS> he tried to kill me recently , very recently . <EOS>
<SOS> i loved him , as much as any father ever loved his son . <EOS>
<SOS> what a storm ! <EOS>
<SOS> excuse me , propn propn ’ s chilly . <EOS>
<SOS> stay warm . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , let ’ s all go inside . <EOS>
<SOS> this way , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , my dear greek philosopher . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll get my revenge before i leave this house . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m afraid to think how i ’ ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you . <EOS>
<SOS> now i realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man , but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself . <EOS>
<SOS> how unlucky am i , having to apologize for doing the right thing ! <EOS>
<SOS> come with me to see the duchess . <EOS>
<SOS> if this letter ’ s right , you ’ ve got a lot to deal with . <EOS>
<SOS> right or not , it ’ s made you the propn of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i put my trust in you . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s better here than outside . <EOS>
<SOS> be happy about it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do what i can to make you even more comfortable . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t be gone long . <EOS>
<SOS> he ca n ’ t bear his grief and so he ’ s losing his mind . <EOS>
<SOS> may propn reward you for your kindness ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s a king , a king ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , he ’ s an ordinary guy who ’ s got a gentleman for a son , since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he ’ s achieved that distinction himself . <EOS>
<SOS> i see propn and propn in hell — a thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them ! <EOS>
<SOS> the nasty devil ’ s biting my butt . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do it . <EOS>
<SOS> the devil sings like a nightingale to haunt propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the demon propn is in propn ’ s belly , crying for some fish to eat . <EOS>
<SOS> stop whining , devil . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve got no food to give you . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s have the evidence . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s give a fair verdict . <EOS>
<SOS> there she is . <EOS>
<SOS> come here , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> is your name propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> she ca n ’ t deny it . <EOS>
<SOS> and here ’ s propn , whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart . <EOS>
<SOS> stop her ! <EOS>
<SOS> fire ! <EOS>
<SOS> you corrupt judge , why did you let her escape ? <EOS>
<SOS> bless your heart . <EOS>
<SOS> look at the three little dogs , propn , propn , and propn — all barking at me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn will chase them off .— go away , you mongrels ! <EOS>
<SOS> whether you bite to kill , propn , greyhound , or ugly mutt , <EOS>
<SOS> hound or spaniel , bitch or dog , whether your tail is short or curly— propn will make you cry and wail . <EOS>
<SOS> with one little toss of his head , he can scare you off for good . <EOS>
<SOS> whether your mouth is black or white , do - dee , dee - dee propn . <EOS>
<SOS> stop ! <EOS>
<SOS> run off , go visit fairs and festivals ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , your cup is empty . <EOS>
<SOS> is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart ? <EOS>
<SOS> please lie down and rest a while , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> be quiet , be quiet . <EOS>
<SOS> draw the curtains , just like that . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll have supper in the morning . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s right . <EOS>
<SOS> and i ’ ll go to bed at noon . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s here , sir , but please do n ’ t bother him . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s out of his right mind . <EOS>
<SOS> please get him , my friend , i beg you . <EOS>
<SOS> put <EOS>
<SOS> carry your master out . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , come on . <EOS>
<SOS> when we see that our betters have the same problems we do , we can almost forget our own misery . <EOS>
<SOS> the person who suffers alone suffers the most . <EOS>
<SOS> companions in sorrow alleviate our grief . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s go , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> whatever else happens tonight , i hope the king escapes safely ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn out of sight . <EOS>
<SOS> hang him immediately . <EOS>
<SOS> propn out his eyes ! <EOS>
<SOS> leave him to my wrath .— edmund , go with my sister - in - law . <EOS>
<SOS> you should n ’ t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father . <EOS>
<SOS> tell the propn of propn to prepare for war immediately . <EOS>
<SOS> we will do the same . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll keep the lines of communication open between us . <EOS>
<SOS> hello . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn has helped him leave . <EOS>
<SOS> thirty - five or thirty - six of his knights met him at the gate , and together with some others they ’ ve set off for propn , where they claim to have powerful friends . <EOS>
<SOS> prepare the horses for your lady . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye , my sweet lord .— propn , my sister . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> go find the traitor propn . <EOS>
<SOS> tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s him . <EOS>
<SOS> tie up his withered old arms . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you doing ? <EOS>
<SOS> my friends , remember that you ’ re my guests here . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t play any nasty tricks on me . <EOS>
<SOS> tie him up , i tell you . <EOS>
<SOS> your highness , i want nothing more than what you ’ ve already offered . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you ’ ll offer nothing less than that . <EOS>
<SOS> there she is , over there . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know what to say . <EOS>
<SOS> so do you take her or leave her ? <EOS>
<SOS> then leave her , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> tie him up harder .— you filthy traitor ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not a traitor , unfair lady . <EOS>
<SOS> tie him to this chair .— you ’ ll see , criminal— by the gods , it ’ s disgraceful for you to pull my beard . <EOS>
<SOS> as old and white - haired as you are , and you ’ re such a traitor ? <EOS>
<SOS> wicked woman , these white hairs you ’ re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong - doing . <EOS>
<SOS> you are my guests . <EOS>
<SOS> this is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think you ’ re doing ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell us about the letters that you got from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> get to the point , since we already know the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> and what ’ s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently ? <EOS>
<SOS> the ones you ’ ve sent our lunatic king to . <EOS>
<SOS> tell us . <EOS>
<SOS> it came from a neutral party , not from someone opposed to you . <EOS>
<SOS> how clever of you . <EOS>
<SOS> clever lies . <EOS>
<SOS> where have you sent the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> why propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> were n ’ t you ordered , on penalty of— why propn ? — let him answer that question first . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m backed into a corner with nowhere to run . <EOS>
<SOS> why propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> because i did n ’ t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails , or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh . <EOS>
<SOS> you left him out in the storm in the black night , bareheaded , a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea , the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars . <EOS>
<SOS> and the poor old man just wept , mixing his tears with the rain . <EOS>
<SOS> if wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm , you would ’ ve told your doorman to let them in , despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world . <EOS>
<SOS> but soon i ’ ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father . <EOS>
<SOS> you wo n ’ t be seeing anything .— hold his chair still , men .— i ’ m going to put my foot on his eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , help me , anyone who wants to live long ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , so cruel ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh dear gods ! <EOS>
<SOS> now he ’ s a little crooked . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve served you since childhood , but i ’ ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s this , you dog ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am willing to fight you if i must . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you mean by all this ? <EOS>
<SOS> come on then . <EOS>
<SOS> i am dying ! —my lord , you still have one eye left to see propn punished . <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s your sparkle now ? <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s my son propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> wrong , evil traitor . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re appealing to a son who hates you . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s too good to have any compassion for you . <EOS>
<SOS> what a fool i ’ ve been ! <EOS>
<SOS> this means i ’ ve mistreated propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he can sniff his way to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m wounded . <EOS>
<SOS> follow me , madam .— throw the blind traitor outside . <EOS>
<SOS> and throw this dead peasant into the manure pit .— propn , i ’ m bleeding . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a bad time for such an injury . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your arm . <EOS>
<SOS> if our criminal master gets off free , i wo n ’ t care what happens to me anymore . <EOS>
<SOS> if she lives a long and happy life , then all women may as well turn into monsters . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s follow the old earl , and get that crazy propn to take him wherever he wants to go . <EOS>
<SOS> as a wandering lunatic , he can do whatever he wants . <EOS>
<SOS> go ahead . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face . <EOS>
<SOS> propn help him ! <EOS>
<SOS> at the bottom , any change is for the better . <EOS>
<SOS> so i welcome this wind freely . <EOS>
<SOS> but who is this ? <EOS>
<SOS> my father , led by a poor peasant ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , life is full of surprises ! <EOS>
<SOS> we age and die because they wear us out . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years . <EOS>
<SOS> away , get out of here . <EOS>
<SOS> leave me , my friend . <EOS>
<SOS> but you ca n ’ t see where you ’ re going , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t have anywhere to go , so i do n ’ t need to see . <EOS>
<SOS> when i could see , i did n ’ t always see clearly . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s often the case that having something makes us spoiled , while not having it turns out to be advantageous . <EOS>
<SOS> if i live long enough to touch you again , that would be as good as having my eyesight back . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s that ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> is it a beggar ? <EOS>
<SOS> i was reminded of my son , even though i despised my son at that time . <EOS>
<SOS> now i know better . <EOS>
<SOS> is that the naked guy ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> but sir , he ’ s crazy . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind . <EOS>
<SOS> do as i asked you . <EOS>
<SOS> or rather , do what you feel like doing . <EOS>
<SOS> hey , naked guy— propn propn ’ s chilly . <EOS>
<SOS> come here , man . <EOS>
<SOS> do you know the way to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn has been scared out of his mind . <EOS>
<SOS> bless you , master . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea . <EOS>
<SOS> take me to the edge of it , and i ’ ll reward all your troubles with something valuable . <EOS>
<SOS> once i ’ m there , i wo n ’ t need a guide anymore . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your arm . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn will take you there . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m surprised my bland husband did n ’ t meet me on the way here . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s your master ? <EOS>
<SOS> but it ’ d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible . <EOS>
<SOS> enough . <EOS>
<SOS> it would ’ ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did . <EOS>
<SOS> you mean this is the whole problem , that she is shy and has n ’ t said everything she means to say and do ? — my lord of propn , what do you have to say to this lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> love ’ s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters . <EOS>
<SOS> will you marry her ? <EOS>
<SOS> she herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m at your service until death . <EOS>
<SOS> my dear propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> what a man ! —especially compared to my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund , you deserve me to be your woman . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a fool sharing my bed now . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my master ’ s coming . <EOS>
<SOS> so you finally find me worthy of your attentions . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you are n ’ t worth the dust the wind blows in your face . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t trust you . <EOS>
<SOS> you ca n ’ t trust anyone who abuses her own father , her flesh and blood . <EOS>
<SOS> she will wither and come to a bad end . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , shut up . <EOS>
<SOS> your words are idiotic . <EOS>
<SOS> bad people ca n ’ t appreciate wisdom or goodness . <EOS>
<SOS> they only like things as bad as themselves . <EOS>
<SOS> what have you two sisters done ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re tigers , not daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> could my good brother - in - law — a man to whom the <EOS>
<SOS> coward ! <EOS>
<SOS> shame on you , warped hag ! <EOS>
<SOS> your true demonic features are distorting your body . <EOS>
<SOS> if i let myself do what i yearn to , i ’ d rip the flesh off your bones . <EOS>
<SOS> but i wo n ’ t attack a woman , even if she is a demon . <EOS>
<SOS> i sneeze on your manhood . <EOS>
<SOS> what news do you bring ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s eyes ? <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s justice in propn after all ! <EOS>
<SOS> that these crimes are punished so quickly is proof . <EOS>
<SOS> but oh , poor propn - cester ! <EOS>
<SOS> did he lose his other eye ? <EOS>
<SOS> he lost both , my lord .— propn , this letter is from your sister , and needs an immediate answer . <EOS>
<SOS> he was on his way here with your wife . <EOS>
<SOS> but he is n ’ t here now . <EOS>
<SOS> no , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> he was the one who denounced his father . <EOS>
<SOS> what else you do know ? <EOS>
<SOS> do you know why the propn of propn suddenly went back home ? <EOS>
<SOS> it was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence . <EOS>
<SOS> whom did he leave in charge here ? <EOS>
<SOS> the marshal of propn , propn propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> was propn propn aggrieved by the letters you delivered ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> she seemed to be trying to control her emotions , which were overwhelming her . <EOS>
<SOS> so she was moved by it ? <EOS>
<SOS> if everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow , then sorrow would be highly prized . <EOS>
<SOS> she did n ’ t ask anything ? <EOS>
<SOS> actually , once or twice she sighed and said , “ father , ” as if the word were pressing on her chest . <EOS>
<SOS> once she exclaimed , “ propn , sisters , shame on you ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , father , sisters ! <EOS>
<SOS> what , out in a storm in the middle of the night ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t believe it . ” the tears fell from her eyes like holy water . <EOS>
<SOS> then she ran away to grieve alone . <EOS>
<SOS> have you not spoken to her since then ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> did this happen before the propn of propn returned home ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , afterward . <EOS>
<SOS> why , good sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s too overwhelmed with shame . <EOS>
<SOS> he remembers how unkind he was to her , how he disowned her and sent her abroad , how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog - hearted sisters . <EOS>
<SOS> all those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , the poor man ! <EOS>
<SOS> have you heard about propn ’ s and propn ’ s troops ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have . <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ re on the march . <EOS>
<SOS> well , sir , i ’ ll take you to propn and have you stay with him a while . <EOS>
<SOS> i have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer . <EOS>
<SOS> when i ’ ve revealed my true identity , you ’ ll be glad you took the time to help me out . <EOS>
<SOS> please come with me . <EOS>
<SOS> sadly , it ’ s the king that ’ s missing . <EOS>
<SOS> they saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea , singing loudly , wearing a crown of nettles , thorns , hemlock , and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields .— send out a hundred soldiers to find him . <EOS>
<SOS> search high and low , in every acre of the fields , and bring him here for me to see him . <EOS>
<SOS> there is a way , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> but there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while . <EOS>
<SOS> then i ’ ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow . <EOS>
<SOS> may they relieve a sick old man ’ s suffering . <EOS>
<SOS> go find those herbs for him , before his madness puts his life in danger . <EOS>
<SOS> i have news , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> the british forces are on their way here . <EOS>
<SOS> we already knew that . <EOS>
<SOS> our forces are ready for them . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , father , i ’ m taking care of your business . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s why the propn of propn listened to my pleas and tears . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ re not invading propn out of ambition or greed , but out of love — dear love ! —and my father ’ s right to his kingdom . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope i see him and hear him again soon . <EOS>
<SOS> have my brother - in - law ’ s troops been mobilized ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> is he there in person ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , making a big fuss . <EOS>
<SOS> your sister ’ s the better soldier of the two . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn did n ’ t speak to your master at home ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> what could my sister ’ s letter to him say ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> he rushed away on serious business . <EOS>
<SOS> it was a huge mistake to let old propn live after we blinded him . <EOS>
<SOS> wherever he goes , he inspires compassion and people turn against us . <EOS>
<SOS> and also to find out the size of the enemy army . <EOS>
<SOS> i have to follow him and give him the letter . <EOS>
<SOS> our troops are deployed tomorrow . <EOS>
<SOS> stay with us tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s dangerous out there . <EOS>
<SOS> peace to you , my lord of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> since you love money and power so much , i wo n ’ t be your wife . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now , if it ’ s okay that i ’ m picking up what others have thrown away . <EOS>
<SOS> no propn of spineless propn can take this treasure of a girl from me now .— say goodbye to them , propn , even though they ’ ve been unkind to you . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s no longer my daughter , and i ’ ll never see her face again . <EOS>
<SOS> say goodbye to your sisters . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> my lady ordered me to deliver her letter . <EOS>
<SOS> why would she write to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> it probably has something to do with … i do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i ’ d rather— i know your lady propn does n ’ t love her husband . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sure of that . <EOS>
<SOS> and when she was here recently she flirted with propn and gave him significant glances . <EOS>
<SOS> i know she trusts you and tells you everything . <EOS>
<SOS> me , ma'am ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know what i ’ m talking about . <EOS>
<SOS> so i recommend you take note of what i ’ m about to say . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund and i have talked , and it makes more sense for him to marry me than propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you can figure out the rest . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> when will we get to the top of that cliff ? <EOS>
<SOS> the ground feels flat to me . <EOS>
<SOS> no , it ’ s dreadfully steep . <EOS>
<SOS> no , really , i do n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness . <EOS>
<SOS> it may be so . <EOS>
<SOS> it seems to me that your voice has changed , and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re mistaken about all that . <EOS>
<SOS> the only thing different about me is my clothes . <EOS>
<SOS> i think you ’ re more articulate . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the place . <EOS>
<SOS> stand still . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s so scary to look down ! <EOS>
<SOS> the crows flying down below look as small as ants . <EOS>
<SOS> halfway down the cliff there ’ s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs — a risky business ! <EOS>
<SOS> that big ship over there looks no bigger <EOS>
<SOS> up here you ca n ’ t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks . <EOS>
<SOS> lead me to where you ’ re standing . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re now within a foot of the cliff ’ s edge . <EOS>
<SOS> let go of my hand . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye , good sir . <EOS>
<SOS> with all my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you mighty gods ! <EOS>
<SOS> gone , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye . <EOS>
<SOS> go away and let me die . <EOS>
<SOS> you just fell the height of ten ship masts , straight down . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a miracle you ’ re alive . <EOS>
<SOS> say something again . <EOS>
<SOS> but did i fall or not ? <EOS>
<SOS> you fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff . <EOS>
<SOS> look for yourself — see the top of the cliff way up there ? <EOS>
<SOS> the lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard . <EOS>
<SOS> just look . <EOS>
<SOS> it used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your arm . <EOS>
<SOS> get up . <EOS>
<SOS> how do you feel ? <EOS>
<SOS> can you feel your legs ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re standing . <EOS>
<SOS> only too well . <EOS>
<SOS> this is beyond weird . <EOS>
<SOS> what was that thing i saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell ? <EOS>
<SOS> that was a poor unlucky beggar . <EOS>
<SOS> from down here , i thought his eyes looked like full moons . <EOS>
<SOS> he had a thousand noses and twisted horns , like wave crests in a storm at sea . <EOS>
<SOS> it was some devil . <EOS>
<SOS> i understand now . <EOS>
<SOS> from now on i ’ ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out , “ enough , enough ! ” and disappears . <EOS>
<SOS> i thought that thing you ’ re talking about was a man . <EOS>
<SOS> propn up and be at peace . <EOS>
<SOS> but who is that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m the king himself . <EOS>
<SOS> life ’ s better at <EOS>
<SOS> piece of cheese will get him .— i challenge you to a match . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , that arrow was well shot . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>

<SOS> i know that voice . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> goneril with a white beard ? <EOS>
<SOS> i tell you , they are not honest men . <EOS>
<SOS> they told me i was everything . <EOS>
<SOS> i recognize something about that voice . <EOS>
<SOS> is n ’ t that the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , every inch a king . <EOS>
<SOS> i pardon that man . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you accused of ? <EOS>
<SOS> adultery ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll commute your death sentence . <EOS>
<SOS> to die for adultery ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> little birds do it , and dragonflies copulate right in front of me . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s have more sex in the world , since propn ’ s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters , conceived in lawful wedlock , have been to me . <EOS>
<SOS> get to it , be lustful , sleep around — i need soldiers for my army . <EOS>
<SOS> women are sex machines below the waist , though they ’ re chaste up above . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s where hell is , and darkness , and fires and stench ! <EOS>
<SOS> give me an aphrodisiac , pharmacist . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s money in it for you . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , let me kiss his hand ! <EOS>
<SOS> let me wipe it off first . <EOS>
<SOS> i remember your eyes quite well . <EOS>
<SOS> are you squinting at me ? <EOS>
<SOS> read it . <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> with my eye sockets ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh ho , is that what you ’ re getting at ? <EOS>
<SOS> no eyes in your head til there ’ s money in your wallet ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , are you crazy ? <EOS>
<SOS> you do n ’ t need eyes to see how the world works . <EOS>
<SOS> look with your ears . <EOS>
<SOS> look how the judge yells at a simple thief . <EOS>
<SOS> have you seen a farmer ’ s dog bark at a beggar ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> and you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s authority ! <EOS>
<SOS> you stupid cop , stop your violence ! <EOS>
<SOS> why are you whipping that whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> you should be whipping yourself , since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you ’ re punishing her . <EOS>
<SOS> one criminal punishes another . <EOS>
<SOS> you ca n ’ t blame anyone for it anyone , i say . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll vouch for that . <EOS>
<SOS> believe me , my friend , since i have the power to stop the prosecutors . <EOS>
<SOS> harder , harder . <EOS>
<SOS> like that . <EOS>
<SOS> if you want to cry over my bad luck , i ’ ll give you my eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you . <EOS>
<SOS> your name propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you have to be patient with me . <EOS>
<SOS> i came here crying . <EOS>
<SOS> the first time we see the world as newborns , we cry and scream . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll read you a sermon . <EOS>
<SOS> listen to this . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , how awful ! <EOS>
<SOS> when we ’ re born , we cry because we ’ ve arrived on the stage of life , like all the other fools . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s a nice hat you ’ ve got there . <EOS>
<SOS> how ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll test it out . <EOS>
<SOS> and when i ’ ve sneaked up on my sons - in - law , then i ’ ll kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill ! <EOS>
<SOS> what , i ’ m a prisoner ? <EOS>
<SOS> no rescue for me ? <EOS>
<SOS> treat me well . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a ransom . <EOS>
<SOS> i need a doctor . <EOS>
<SOS> my brains are injured . <EOS>
<SOS> you can have anything you want . <EOS>
<SOS> will no one back me up ? <EOS>
<SOS> am i all alone ? <EOS>
<SOS> that would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears . <EOS>
<SOS> good sir— <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll die you ’ re of royal blood , and we obey you . <EOS>
<SOS> then there ’ s still a chance . <EOS>
<SOS> come and get it ! <EOS>
<SOS> but you ’ ll have to catch me ! <EOS>
<SOS> catch me if you can ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn , propn , sa . <EOS>
<SOS> in a king , the sight is unbearable . <EOS>
<SOS> hello , good sir . <EOS>
<SOS> how do you do , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> how can i help you ? <EOS>
<SOS> have you heard any news of impending battle ? <EOS>
<SOS> certainly . <EOS>
<SOS> everyone who can hear has heard about it . <EOS>
<SOS> could you tell me how near the enemy is ? <EOS>
<SOS> very near , and approaching fast . <EOS>
<SOS> the main body of the army is expected here any hour now . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s all i wanted to know . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you for what you really are , but as your sister i ’ m reluctant to criticize you . <EOS>
<SOS> i leave him in your care — but oh , if only i were still in his favor i could arrange for better care for him . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye to you both . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t tell us what our duty is . <EOS>
<SOS> propn will tell what you ’ ve got up your sleeve . <EOS>
<SOS> have a good life . <EOS>
<SOS> come with me , my dear propn . <EOS>
<SOS> sister , i have a lot to say about things that concern us both . <EOS>
<SOS> i think that our father will leave here tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i ’ m sure he will — to stay with you . <EOS>
<SOS> next month he ’ ll stay with us . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s so flighty in his old age , as we keep noticing . <EOS>
<SOS> he has always loved propn best , and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious . <EOS>
<SOS> the queen is here on special business , and her army has moved on . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> gentle gods in propn , please let me die . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t tempt me to suicide again . <EOS>
<SOS> pray well , father . <EOS>
<SOS> and who are you , good sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m a poor man who ’ s been humbled by many misfortunes . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you very much . <EOS>
<SOS> may propn bless you . <EOS>
<SOS> what good luck ! <EOS>
<SOS> that blind head of yours was created to make me rich . <EOS>
<SOS> you old traitor , repent all your sins . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope you ’ re strong enough to do it . <EOS>
<SOS> whoa , man , you dare to support someone who ’ s been proclaimed a traitor ? <EOS>
<SOS> get out of here , before his bad luck infects you too . <EOS>
<SOS> let go of his arm . <EOS>
<SOS> oh no , sir , i wo n ’ t let him go , sir , not without a good reason . <EOS>
<SOS> let go of him , peasant , or you die ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll knock your teeth out , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> to hell with your sword . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you well . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a hardworking villain who ’ d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to . <EOS>
<SOS> is he dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s look in his pockets . <EOS>
<SOS> the letters he spoke of may help me . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s dead . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m just sorry i had to be the one to kill him . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s see here . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , envelope , open up for me . <EOS>
<SOS> reading their mail is n ’ t as bad . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t forget the vows we made to each other . <EOS>
<SOS> the king is insane . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> i think i hear the drums far away . <EOS>
<SOS> come , father , i ’ ll leave you at a friend ’ s house . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , what could i ever do to become as good as you are ? <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t live long enough , and all my efforts will fail me . <EOS>
<SOS> just being thanked is more than enough for me , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope all reports about me simply tell the truth , no more or less . <EOS>
<SOS> change into better clothes . <EOS>
<SOS> please take them off . <EOS>
<SOS> i have to ask you , as a favor , not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right . <EOS>
<SOS> all right , my lord .— how ’ s the king doing ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s still sleeping , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> would you mind if we woke up the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s slept a long time . <EOS>
<SOS> is he in his royal garments ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> stay close by when we wake him up , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sure he will stay under control . <EOS>
<SOS> all right . <EOS>
<SOS> please come closer.— make the music louder , please ! <EOS>
<SOS> kind and dear princess ! <EOS>
<SOS> if you had n ’ t been their father , your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion . <EOS>
<SOS> and were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a wonder you did n ’ t lose your life and your mind all at once .— he ’ s waking up . <EOS>
<SOS> talk to him . <EOS>
<SOS> you talk to him , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s most appropriate . <EOS>
<SOS> how are you , my royal lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> how is your majesty doing ? <EOS>
<SOS> you do me wrong by taking me out of the grave . <EOS>
<SOS> even my tears burn me like molten lead . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , do you know who i am ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a spirit , i know . <EOS>
<SOS> where did you die ? <EOS>
<SOS> let him be for a bit . <EOS>
<SOS> where have i been ? <EOS>
<SOS> where am i ? <EOS>
<SOS> is it daytime ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve been tricked . <EOS>
<SOS> i would die of pity to see someone else in my condition . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know what to say . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t even be sure these are my hands . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s see . <EOS>
<SOS> i feel this pinprick . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i knew what is happening . <EOS>
<SOS> please do n ’ t make fun of me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m a foolish , senile old man , eighty - something years old , not an hour more or less . <EOS>
<SOS> to put it plainly , i ’ m afraid i ’ m not quite sane . <EOS>
<SOS> i feel i should recognize you and that man <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t recall where i slept last night . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t laugh at me , but i swear i think this lady is my child propn . <EOS>
<SOS> and i am , i am . <EOS>
<SOS> are your tears wet ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , indeed they are . <EOS>
<SOS> please do n ’ t cry . <EOS>
<SOS> if you have poison for me , i ’ ll drink it . <EOS>
<SOS> but you did n ’ t , even though you had every reason . <EOS>
<SOS> i had no reason , no reason . <EOS>
<SOS> am i in propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re in your own kingdom , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t deceive me . <EOS>
<SOS> you can relax , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> his insane period is over . <EOS>
<SOS> but it ’ s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost . <EOS>
<SOS> ask him to go in . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t trouble him further until his mind is more settled . <EOS>
<SOS> would your highness like to take a walk ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll have to bear with me . <EOS>
<SOS> please forgive and forget . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m old and foolish . <EOS>
<SOS> is it true , sir , that the propn of propn was killed as they say ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , it ’ s true , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> who is leading his men ? <EOS>
<SOS> they say propn ’ s bastard son is . <EOS>
<SOS> i hear that propn , propn ’ s exiled son , is with the propn of propn in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you ca n ’ t trust all the rumors . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s time to reassess the situation . <EOS>
<SOS> the british troops are coming near . <EOS>
<SOS> it will likely be a bloody fight . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m afraid that may be the case , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> now , my sweet lord , you know how much i like you . <EOS>
<SOS> tell me truthfully , do you love my sister ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m just worried that you ’ ve been cozying up to her , and gotten intimate with her . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i swear on my honor , i have n ’ t , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s going senile . <EOS>
<SOS> but then again he ’ s never really understood his own feelings very well . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life . <EOS>
<SOS> now that he ’ s old , we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws , which have turned into deep - rooted habits , but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll probably witness many more outbursts from him , like banishing propn . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s still the propn of propn ’ s farewell ceremony . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s put our heads together . <EOS>
<SOS> if our father continues to use his authority as usual , then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll have to think about it carefully . <EOS>
<SOS> we have to strike while the iron ’ s hot . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t stand her . <EOS>
<SOS> please , my lord , do n ’ t be friendly with her . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t worry about me .— your sister and the duke are here . <EOS>
<SOS> noble words , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> why are we talking about this ? <EOS>
<SOS> then let ’ s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll meet you at your tent . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , are you coming with us ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s the best thing to do . <EOS>
<SOS> please come with me . <EOS>
<SOS> wait until i read the letter . <EOS>
<SOS> i was ordered not to . <EOS>
<SOS> when the time comes , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and i ’ ll return . <EOS>
<SOS> goodbye , then . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll take a look at your letter . <EOS>
<SOS> prepare your troops . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll be ready when the time comes . <EOS>
<SOS> which one of them should i pick ? <EOS>
<SOS> both ? <EOS>
<SOS> one ? <EOS>
<SOS> neither ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t enjoy either of them as long as the other one ’ s alive . <EOS>
<SOS> propn would go crazy if i chose propn , but it would be hard to get in with propn while her husband ’ s still alive . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll use propn ’ s power and authority for now to win the war , but afterward one of the sisters — whichever one wants to — can get rid of him . <EOS>
<SOS> if i ever come back , i ’ ll bring you good news . <EOS>
<SOS> good luck , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> we have to get out of here , old man . <EOS>
<SOS> let me help you up . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s go ! <EOS>
<SOS> he and his daughter are captured . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> come on . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t go any further , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> come on . <EOS>
<SOS> and that ’ s true too . <EOS>
<SOS> officers , take them away . <EOS>
<SOS> guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them . <EOS>
<SOS> no , no , no , no ! <EOS>
<SOS> come on , let ’ s go to prison . <EOS>
<SOS> the two of us together will sing like birds in a cage . <EOS>
<SOS> when you ask for my blessing , i ’ ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me . <EOS>
<SOS> in prison we ’ ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change . <EOS>
<SOS> take them away . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn , even the gods admire how much you ’ ve sacrificed for me . <EOS>
<SOS> have i hugged you yet ? <EOS>
<SOS> anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes . <EOS>
<SOS> wipe your eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll watch them starve to death first . <EOS>
<SOS> come on . <EOS>
<SOS> come here , captain . <EOS>
<SOS> listen . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do it , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> when you ’ ve finished , you ’ ll be a happy man . <EOS>
<SOS> go immediately , and do exactly as i wrote down . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse . <EOS>
<SOS> if it ’ s work for a man , i ’ ll do it . <EOS>
<SOS> tody of them so i can do what ’ s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom . <EOS>
<SOS> i sent the french queen with him too , for the same reason . <EOS>
<SOS> we need a more appropriate place to discuss propn and her father . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m sorry , sir , but in this war i consider you a subordinate , not my equal . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s for to me to decide . <EOS>
<SOS> not so fast . <EOS>
<SOS> he has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right , deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ d really be your proxy if he married you . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re so infatuated with him that you ’ re hallucinating . <EOS>
<SOS> are you trying to sleep with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> nor is it up to you , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> yes it is , you half - blood . <EOS>
<SOS> hang on a second . <EOS>
<SOS> what a farce ! <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve got a sword , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> blow the trumpets . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i ’ m sick , sick ! <EOS>
<SOS> i feel sicker and sicker . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s not feeling well . <EOS>
<SOS> take her to my tent . <EOS>
<SOS> come here , propn .— let the trumpet sound ! —read this out . <EOS>
<SOS> blow the trumpet ! <EOS>
<SOS> again ! <EOS>
<SOS> again ! <EOS>
<SOS> who are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> all right then , legitimate brother propn , i have to have your lands . <EOS>
<SOS> look out , i ’ m on my way up . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s been banished just like that ? <EOS>
<SOS> all this so suddenly ? — edmund , what ’ s going on ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the news ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve lost my name and title to a traitor . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ m as noble as my opponent . <EOS>
<SOS> and who is that ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s the spokesman for propn , propn of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m my own spokesman . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you have to say to me ? <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s mine . <EOS>
<SOS> normally i would ask you what your name is first . <EOS>
<SOS> still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart .— trumpets , blow ! <EOS>
<SOS> you were tricked into fighting , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> according to the laws of war , you did n ’ t have to fight a stranger . <EOS>
<SOS> i make the laws , not you . <EOS>
<SOS> who can prosecute me for it ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , monstrous ! <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t ask me what i know . <EOS>
<SOS> follow her . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s desperate . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve done everything you accuse me of — and more , much more . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll find out everything in due time . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s all over now , and so am i. let ’ s forgive each other . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m no less noble than you are , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> if i ’ m more noble than you , you ’ ve done me wrong . <EOS>
<SOS> my name is propn , and i ’ m your father ’ s son . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods are fair , and they use our little vices to punish us . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re right . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s true . <EOS>
<SOS> let me embrace you . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear i never hated you or your father ! <EOS>
<SOS> i know , prince . <EOS>
<SOS> where have you been hiding ? <EOS>
<SOS> how did you know what happened to your poor father ? <EOS>
<SOS> listen to my little story , and when it ’ s done , oh , my heart will break ! <EOS>
<SOS> to escape the decree condemning me <EOS>
<SOS> i became his guide , i led him and begged for him , and kept him from suicide . <EOS>
<SOS> i never — oh , what a mistake ! —revealed myself to him until half an hour ago , when i was in my armor . <EOS>
<SOS> but his frail heart , too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness , gave out . <EOS>
<SOS> your words have moved me , and maybe it ’ ll do some good . <EOS>
<SOS> but go on . <EOS>
<SOS> you look like you have something more to say . <EOS>
<SOS> if there ’ s anything more sorrowful left to add , keep it to yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m almost ready to break down hearing this much . <EOS>
<SOS> this may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness , but if i went on i could outdo it . <EOS>
<SOS> then i heard the trumpets blow twice , and left him there in a trance . <EOS>
<SOS> but who was that man ? <EOS>
<SOS> it was propn , sir , the exiled propn , who , after the king treated him like an enemy of the state , put on a disguise and followed his king , carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave . <EOS>
<SOS> help , help , oh , help ! <EOS>
<SOS> what kind of help do you need ? <EOS>
<SOS> say something , man ! <EOS>
<SOS> what is that bloody knife ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s still warm from the cut . <EOS>
<SOS> it was just removed from from the heart of — oh , she ’ s dead ! <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> speak , man . <EOS>
<SOS> your wife , sir , your wife . <EOS>
<SOS> and her sister propn dead too , poisoned by your wife . <EOS>
<SOS> she confessed . <EOS>
<SOS> i was engaged to both of them . <EOS>
<SOS> all three of us will marry now in death . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i thought the king preferred the propn of propn to the propn of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> we used to think so too . <EOS>
<SOS> but the way he ’ s divided the kingdom recently , nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i ’ ve been responsible for his upbringing . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve had to acknowledge that he ’ s my son so many times that now i can do it without embarrassment . <EOS>
<SOS> do you smell something naughty ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , i would n ’ t want to undo the naughtiness , since the boy turned out so well . <EOS>
<SOS> but i have a legitimate son a few years older than this one , and i do n ’ t love him any more than i love my bastard . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , is that propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve come to say farewell to my king and master . <EOS>
<SOS> is n ’ t he here ? <EOS>
<SOS> what an enormous thing for us to forget ! —edmund , tell us , where ’ s the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> and where propn propn do you see this , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , why is this so ? <EOS>
<SOS> still , propn was beloved . <EOS>
<SOS> one of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me , and then killed herself . <EOS>
<SOS> apparently so .— cover their faces . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i could live longer . <EOS>
<SOS> i want to do a little good despite my evil nature . <EOS>
<SOS> go quickly — hurry — to the castle , for i ’ ve given orders to have propn and propn killed . <EOS>
<SOS> hurry , send someone immediately ! <EOS>
<SOS> run , run , oh , run ! <EOS>
<SOS> whom should we look for in the castle ? — whose job is it ? <EOS>
<SOS> send something along to prove you ’ re withdrawing the orders . <EOS>
<SOS> good idea . <EOS>
<SOS> take my sword . <EOS>
<SOS> the captain — give it to the captain . <EOS>
<SOS> run as if your life depended on it . <EOS>
<SOS> my wife and i ordered him to hang propn in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair . <EOS>
<SOS> propn help her ! —get him out of here for now . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , howl , howl , howl ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you men are made of stone ! <EOS>
<SOS> if i were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with , i ’ d crack propn wide open with my laments ! <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s gone forever . <EOS>
<SOS> i know how to tell when someone is alive or dead . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s as dead as the cold ground . <EOS>
<SOS> let me borrow a mirror . <EOS>
<SOS> if her breath steams up the glass , then she ’ s alive . <EOS>
<SOS> or just a foretaste of it ? <EOS>
<SOS> let the world collapse around us . <EOS>
<SOS> this feather moved because of her breath . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s alive . <EOS>
<SOS> if that ’ s true , it makes up for all the sorrows i ’ ve ever known . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my good master ! <EOS>
<SOS> please , go away . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s noble propn , your friend . <EOS>
<SOS> curse you all , you ’ re all murderers and traitors ! <EOS>
<SOS> i could have saved her . <EOS>
<SOS> now she ’ s gone forever .— propn , propn , stay a while . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s true , my lords , he did . <EOS>
<SOS> did n ’ t i ? <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ m old now , and suffering has weakened me . <EOS>
<SOS> my vision is dull . <EOS>
<SOS> are n ’ t you propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s me . <EOS>
<SOS> your servant propn . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s your servant <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s a good fellow , i can tell you that much . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s dead and rotting in the dirt now . <EOS>
<SOS> no , my lord , that was me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m the one who— i ’ ll get right on that . <EOS>
<SOS> followed you on your sad wanderings , ever since your bad luck began . <EOS>
<SOS> nice to see you . <EOS>
<SOS> it was me , no one else . <EOS>
<SOS> everything is gloomy , dark , and dreadful . <EOS>
<SOS> your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i think that ’ s true . <EOS>
<SOS> he does n ’ t know what he ’ s saying . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund is dead , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> as for me , i ’ m surrendering all my power over to him , giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life . <EOS>
<SOS> and my poor he ’ s fainted .— my lord , my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t disturb his soul . <EOS>
<SOS> let it go up to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , he ’ s really gone . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s amazing is how long he lasted . <EOS>
<SOS> carry them away . <EOS>
<SOS> our business now is mourning and grief . <EOS>
<SOS> why are you hiding that letter ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t have any news to report , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s that paper you were reading ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s nothing , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> no ? <EOS>
<SOS> then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ? <EOS>
<SOS> if it were nothing , you would n ’ t need to hide it . <EOS>
<SOS> please , sir , i beg you . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s a letter from my brother that i have n ’ t finished reading yet . <EOS>
<SOS> give me that letter , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> now i ’ ll offend you whether i give it to you or not . <EOS>
<SOS> the problem is in what the letter says , as far as i can tell . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope for my brother ’ s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor . <EOS>
<SOS> i will have to go on a journey to death soon , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> my master ’ s calling me . <EOS>
<SOS> i ca n ’ t say no . <EOS>
<SOS> we must remember the gravity of this sad day . <EOS>
<SOS> we should speak what we feel , not what we ought to say . <EOS>
<SOS> come talk to me about this . <EOS>
<SOS> if our father were dead you ’ d receive half of his revenue forever , and you ’ d have my undying love , propn . ” hmm , what ’ s this , a conspiracy ? <EOS>
<SOS> how could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart ? <EOS>
<SOS> how did you get this letter ? <EOS>
<SOS> who delivered it ? <EOS>
<SOS> nobody delivered it , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s what ’ s clever about it . <EOS>
<SOS> it was tossed into the window of my room . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re sure the handwriting is your brother ’ s ? <EOS>
<SOS> if he ’ d written nice things , i ’ d swear yes right away . <EOS>
<SOS> but as it stands , i wish i could believe it was n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> but it is his handwriting ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s his handwriting , my lord , but i hope he did n ’ t mean what he wrote . <EOS>
<SOS> has he ever tested out these ideas on you before ? <EOS>
<SOS> never , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining , the sons should be their fathers ' guardians and manage their fathers ' money . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , what a villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s just what he said in the letter . <EOS>
<SOS> evil villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> go look for him . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll arrest him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> where is he ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not sure , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you , and for no other reason . <EOS>
<SOS> do you think so ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ca n ’ t possibly be such a monster— and i ’ m sure he is n ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> toward his own father who loves him so completely . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> edmund , go find him . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll find him right away , sir , and carry out the business as well as i can . <EOS>
<SOS> these recent eclipses of the sun and moon do n ’ t bode well for us . <EOS>
<SOS> though science can explain them away , disasters still come after eclipses . <EOS>
<SOS> love cools off , friendships break up , and brothers become enemies . <EOS>
<SOS> break out , civil war erupts , kings are betrayed , and the bond between father and son snaps . <EOS>
<SOS> this wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father . <EOS>
<SOS> the king acts unnaturally — father against child . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ve seen the best our age has to offer . <EOS>
<SOS> conspiracies , fakery , betrayal , and disorder are all that ’ s left until we die . <EOS>
<SOS> find out what this villainous propn is thinking , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you wo n ’ t lose any respect . <EOS>
<SOS> just do it carefully .— and to think that the noble and loyal propn has been banished , for the crime of telling the truth ! <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s strange , strange . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a classic example of the idiocy of the world : when we ’ re down and out — often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if they forced us to be bad , or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid . <EOS>
<SOS> my father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending , and i was born under the propn propn , so it ’ s inevitable that i ’ m rude and oversexed . <EOS>
<SOS> i would have been what i am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception . <EOS>
<SOS> fa , sol , la , mi . <EOS>
<SOS> hello , brother propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you thinking about so seriously ? <EOS>
<SOS> how long have you believed in astrology ? <EOS>
<SOS> come on . <EOS>
<SOS> when was the last time you saw my father ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , last night . <EOS>
<SOS> did you speak to him ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , we talked for a couple of hours . <EOS>
<SOS> did you leave on good terms ? <EOS>
<SOS> did he express any dissatisfaction with you , either in his words or his face ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , none at all . <EOS>
<SOS> some villain has told lies about me . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s what i ’ m afraid of . <EOS>
<SOS> i suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little . <EOS>
<SOS> in the meantime , come home with me , and when the time is right i ’ ll take you to talk to him . <EOS>
<SOS> please go . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s my key . <EOS>
<SOS> if you go outside , arm yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> arm myself ? <EOS>
<SOS> brother , i ’ m giving you good advice . <EOS>
<SOS> arm yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> now please go . <EOS>
<SOS> will i hear from you soon ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll help you through this business . <EOS>
<SOS> a gullible father and a brother who ’ s so innocent that he ca n ’ t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him — these are the two fools i need for my plan to work . <EOS>
<SOS> i know exactly how to proceed . <EOS>
<SOS> if i ca n ’ t have an estate by birthright , then i ’ ll get it by being clever . <EOS>
<SOS> any trick that works is good for me . <EOS>
<SOS> did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> he constantly offends me . <EOS>
<SOS> every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t stand for it . <EOS>
<SOS> his knights are getting out of control , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail . <EOS>
<SOS> when he comes back from hunting , i ’ m not going to speak to him . <EOS>
<SOS> tell him i ’ m sick . <EOS>
<SOS> and if you ’ re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be , that ’ ll be good . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll take responsibility for it . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s coming , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> i hear him . <EOS>
<SOS> be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him — you and the other servants . <EOS>
<SOS> if he does n ’ t like it , he can go live with my sister . <EOS>
<SOS> that useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he ’ s given away . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear , old fools become like babies again . <EOS>
<SOS> remember what i ’ ve told you . <EOS>
<SOS> very well , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> and make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t worry about the consequences . <EOS>
<SOS> tell your men as much . <EOS>
<SOS> i want this to provoke confrontations , so i can give him a piece of my mind . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll write to my sister and tell her my plans . <EOS>
<SOS> now go , set up for dinner . <EOS>
<SOS> if i can disguise my voice as well as my appearance , then i ’ ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly . <EOS>
<SOS> i love my master , and he ’ ll find me very hard - working . <EOS>
<SOS> do n ’ t make me wait for dinner even a moment . <EOS>
<SOS> get it ready immediately . <EOS>
<SOS> a man , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s your profession ? <EOS>
<SOS> what do you want from me ? <EOS>
<SOS> but who are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> an honest guy who ’ s as poor as the king . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ re as poor a subject as he is a king , you definitely are poor . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you want ? <EOS>
<SOS> to work as a servant . <EOS>
<SOS> who do you want to work for ? <EOS>
<SOS> you . <EOS>
<SOS> do you know me ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what work can you do ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can be discreet in honorable matters , ride a horse , run , tell a good story badly , and deliver a plain message bluntly . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m good at everything that ordinary men can do . <EOS>
<SOS> the best thing about me is that i ’ m hardworking . <EOS>
<SOS> how old are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well , but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m forty - eight . <EOS>
<SOS> follow me . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll work for me . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s my fool ? — go call my fool and have him come here . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i do n ’ t , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> very pleased to meet you , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i look forward to getting to know you better . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll try to make myself worth your knowledge . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s been gone for nine years and he ’ s leaving again soon . <EOS>
<SOS> the king is coming . <EOS>
<SOS> go escort the lords of propn and propn , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> you , sir , where ’ s my daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> i beg your pardon , sir— what did that guy say ? <EOS>
<SOS> call the numbskull back in here . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s my fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ d think everyone was asleep . <EOS>
<SOS> so what ’ s going on ? <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s that dog ? <EOS>
<SOS> he says your daughter ’ s not feeling well , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> why did n ’ t the jerk come back to me when i called him ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , he told me quite bluntly that he did n ’ t feel like it . <EOS>
<SOS> did n ’ t feel like it ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i do n ’ t know what ’ s going on , but it seems to me that your highness is n ’ t being treated as politely as before . <EOS>
<SOS> the servants , the duke , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly . <EOS>
<SOS> huh ! <EOS>
<SOS> do you really mean that ? <EOS>
<SOS> please forgive me if i ’ m mistaken , my lord — but i ca n ’ t keep quiet when i think you ’ re being insulted . <EOS>
<SOS> no , you ’ re just reminding me of something i ’ ve also noticed . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve felt neglected recently , but i decided that it was more likely that i was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll look into it further . <EOS>
<SOS> but where ’ s my fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have n ’ t seen him for two days . <EOS>
<SOS> ever since propn left for propn , sir , the fool has been depressed . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s not talk about it . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve noticed it myself . <EOS>
<SOS> go and tell my daughter i want to speak with her . <EOS>
<SOS> and you , go call my fool . <EOS>
<SOS> you there , sir , come here please . <EOS>
<SOS> who am i , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> you scoundrel ! <EOS>
<SOS> you lowlife son - of - a - bitch ! <EOS>
<SOS> you dog , you peasant ! <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t be hit , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> now , my friendly servant , thank you . <EOS>
<SOS> wait , let me hire him too .— here ’ s my fool ’ s cap , a token of my gratitude . <EOS>
<SOS> well hello , my good boy . <EOS>
<SOS> how are you doing ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> for standing up for this unpopular king . <EOS>
<SOS> no , if you ca n ’ t adjust to political changes , you ’ ll suffer for it . <EOS>
<SOS> there , take my fool ’ s cap . <EOS>
<SOS> this guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to . <EOS>
<SOS> if you work for him , you ’ re a fool and should wear a fool ’ s cap .— so how ’ s it going , uncle ? <EOS>
<SOS> i wish i had two fool ’ s caps and two daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> why , my boy ? <EOS>
<SOS> if i gave them all i own , i ’ d have two fool ’ s caps for myself . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s mine . <EOS>
<SOS> ask your daughters for another one . <EOS>
<SOS> watch out , boy — remember i can whip you . <EOS>
<SOS> a constant pain to me ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll recite something for you , guy . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , do that . <EOS>
<SOS> listen up , uncle . <EOS>
<SOS> have more than you show , speak less than you know , lend less than you owe . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> in that case it ’ s like the words of an unpaid lawyer . <EOS>
<SOS> why , no , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing can be made out of nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re a bitter fool . <EOS>
<SOS> do you know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet one ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , son . <EOS>
<SOS> tell me . <EOS>
<SOS> bring here the gentleman who advised you to give away your land . <EOS>
<SOS> you can stand in his place . <EOS>
<SOS> the sweet and bitter fool will appear right away . <EOS>
<SOS> the sweet fool in a fool ’ s costume — that ’ s me . <EOS>
<SOS> the bitter one is the other one — that ’ s you . propn are you calling me a fool , boy ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , you ’ ve given away all your other rightful titles . <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> which two crowns would those be ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , when i cut the egg in half and eat the whites , the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns . <EOS>
<SOS> if i ’ m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this , whip the first person who thinks i sound foolish . <EOS>
<SOS> when did you become so fond of singing , boy ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down , please , uncle , hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie . <EOS>
<SOS> i want to learn how to lie . <EOS>
<SOS> if you lie , boy , we ’ ll have you whipped . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m amazed how similar you and your daughters are . <EOS>
<SOS> they want to whip me for telling the truth , you want to whip me for lying , and sometimes i ’ m even whipped for keeping quiet . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d rather be anything besides a fool . <EOS>
<SOS> and yet i would n ’ t want to be you , uncle . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes the owner of one piece . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s going on , daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> why are you frowning like that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think you ’ ve been frowning too much recently . <EOS>
<SOS> the man who gives away his crust and his crumbs will discover that he needs some crumbs back . <EOS>
<SOS> will damage your reputation with them — and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre . <EOS>
<SOS> however , this is an extreme situation , and it ’ s more important to control it than to worry about how you ’ ll look . <EOS>
<SOS> you know , uncle , a sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow ’ s head off . <EOS>
<SOS> so the candle went out and now we ’ re all in the dark . <EOS>
<SOS> are you my daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> does anyone here know who i am ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m not propn . <EOS>
<SOS> where are his eyes ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t think so . <EOS>
<SOS> who can tell me who i am ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re propn ’ s shadow . <EOS>
<SOS> daughters who can make you obey them . <EOS>
<SOS> this fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ m asking you to understand my point of view . <EOS>
<SOS> since you ’ re old and respected , you should be wise . <EOS>
<SOS> but you ’ re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly , vulgar , and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel . <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ re such oversexed gluttons that i feel like we ’ re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s shameful , and we have to make some changes right away . <EOS>
<SOS> hell and damnation ! <EOS>
<SOS> saddle up my horses . <EOS>
<SOS> call my knights together . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re not really my daughter , but i still have one daughter left . <EOS>
<SOS> you hit my servants , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll be sorry later , but it ’ ll be too late . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is always hideous , but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster ! <EOS>
<SOS> please , sir , be patient . <EOS>
<SOS> that may be true , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , dear nature , my goddess , listen to me ! <EOS>
<SOS> make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her . <EOS>
<SOS> this land will belong to your and propn ’ s children forever .— and now what does my second daughter propn , the wife of propn , have to say ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell me . <EOS>
<SOS> dear gods in propn , what ’ s the reason for this ? <EOS>
<SOS> and then you ’ ll see that despite what you thought , i ’ ll be as powerful as i was before . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll see , i promise you . <EOS>
<SOS> did you hear that ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you know how much i love you , but still i have to say— propn , please . <EOS>
<SOS> come , sir , no more .— propn , come here ! <EOS>
<SOS> a fox you ’ ve trapped and such a daughter should both be slaughtered , if my fool ’ s cap is worth a rope to bind them . <EOS>
<SOS> so the fool follows you . <EOS>
<SOS> my father ca n ’ t think straight — a hundred knights ! <EOS>
<SOS> you may be exaggerating the risks . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s better than exaggerating our trust . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s always better to get rid of what you ’ re scared of than to be afraid . <EOS>
<SOS> i know how his mind works . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ve written to my sister telling her everything he ’ s said . <EOS>
<SOS> if she welcomes him and his hundred knights after i ’ ve shown how inappropriately he ’ s behaved— here , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> well , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> have you written that letter to my sister yet ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , ma'am . <EOS>
<SOS> take some men and horses and go to her . <EOS>
<SOS> add details of your own to back up what i ’ m saying . <EOS>
<SOS> now go , and hurry back . <EOS>
<SOS> but people often screw things up trying to make them better . <EOS>
<SOS> no , not at all— all right , all right . <EOS>
<SOS> i wo n ’ t sleep until i ’ ve delivered your letter , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> if a man ’ s brain were in his feet , would n ’ t it be susceptible to frostbite ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> your other daughter propn will treat you kindly , you ’ ll see . <EOS>
<SOS> even though she ’ s as similar to propn as one crabapple is like another , still … i know what i know . <EOS>
<SOS> and what do you know , boy ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know that propn will taste just like propn — both of them sour crabapples . <EOS>
<SOS> do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person ’ s face ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> why , to keep the eyes on the sides , so that you can see anything that you ca n ’ t sniff out . <EOS>
<SOS> i was wrong to her— do you know how an oyster makes its shell ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> me neither . <EOS>
<SOS> but i know why a snail carries its house on its back . <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ca n ’ t give his house away to his daughters , leaving himself without shelter . <EOS>
<SOS> i want to forget what i am . <EOS>
<SOS> such a kind father ! —are my horses ready ? <EOS>
<SOS> your attendant asses are getting the horses ready . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a nice reason why the constellation propn has only seven stars in it . <EOS>
<SOS> because it does n ’ t have eight ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s right . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ d make a good fool . <EOS>
<SOS> i could take back my crown by force — what outrageous ingratitude ! <EOS>
<SOS> if you were my fool , uncle , i ’ d have you beaten for getting old before your time . <EOS>
<SOS> how ’ s that ? <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re not supposed to get old until you ’ re wise . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , dear propn , do n ’ t let me go mad ! <EOS>
<SOS> keep me balanced and sane . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t want to go mad . <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ re ready , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> hello , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> hello , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i just saw your father the propn propn and notified him that the propn of propn and his wife propn will stay with him here tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> why is that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know . <EOS>
<SOS> you have n ’ t heard of the war brewing between the propn of propn and propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> not a word . <EOS>
<SOS> you may hear about it soon . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> the duke will be here tonight ? <EOS>
<SOS> his arrival fits perfectly into my plan . <EOS>
<SOS> fast work and a little luck are all i need .— brother , could i have a word with you ? <EOS>
<SOS> come down , brother . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is on the lookout . <EOS>
<SOS> get out of here quickly ! <EOS>
<SOS> it has leaked out that you ’ re hiding here . <EOS>
<SOS> you have n ’ t said anything against the propn of propn , have you ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s rushing on his way here right now , and propn propn with him . <EOS>
<SOS> think about it . <EOS>
<SOS> i hear my father coming . <EOS>
<SOS> forgive me . <EOS>
<SOS> i have to pretend to threaten you with my sword . <EOS>
<SOS> be convincing . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund , where ’ s your wicked brother ? <EOS>
<SOS> look , sir , i ’ m bleeding . <EOS>
<SOS> where is the villain , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ran out that way , sir , when he couldn ’ t— follow him , now ! <EOS>
<SOS> go . <EOS>
<SOS> when he could n ’ t what ? <EOS>
<SOS> in short , when i told him how firmly opposed i was to his hideous plan , he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body , cutting my arm . <EOS>
<SOS> bolstered by righteousness , i prepared to fight , and when he saw my excitement — or perhaps because my shouting scared him — he ran away suddenly . <EOS>
<SOS> let him run far away . <EOS>
<SOS> if he stays in this country he ’ ll be found . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn of propn , my master and patron , is arriving tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> joy except my love for you , and i find that only your majesty ’ s love makes me happy . <EOS>
<SOS> speak . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , “ nothing ” will get you nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> try again . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t have a talent for putting my heart ’ s feelings into words . <EOS>
<SOS> i love you as a child should love her father , neither more nor less . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you saying , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> revise your statement , or you may damage your inheritance . <EOS>
<SOS> justice will be rewarded . <EOS>
<SOS> he answered , “ you penniless bastard ! <EOS>
<SOS> do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours , anyone would believe you ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d deny whatever evidence you had against me — even if it were in my own handwriting — and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery . <EOS>
<SOS> and you must think people are stupid if you believe they would n ’ t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me . ” oh , how monstrously evil ! <EOS>
<SOS> he said he would deny that he wrote his letter ? <EOS>
<SOS> the duke ’ s trumpets . <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know why he ’ s come here . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors . <EOS>
<SOS> the villain wo n ’ t escape . <EOS>
<SOS> the duke will agree with me on that . <EOS>
<SOS> how are you , my friend ? <EOS>
<SOS> ever since i arrived here , just now , i ’ ve been hearing strange rumors . <EOS>
<SOS> how are you , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , madam , my old heart is broken , broken . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my lady , i ’ m ashamed to admit it . <EOS>
<SOS> was n ’ t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do n ’ t know , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , it ’ s too terrible . <EOS>
<SOS> to answer your question , ma'am — yes , he was friendly with those knights . <EOS>
