who 's there ?
no , answer me .
propn , and identify yourself .
long live the king !
propn ?
yes .
you ’ re really on time .
it ’ s just midnight .
go to bed , propn .
thanks for being on time .
it ’ s bitter cold , and i ’ m depressed .
have things been quiet on your watch ?
not a mouse stirring .
well , good night .
if you meet propn and propn , the ones who will watch with me , tell them to hurry up .
i think i hear them .
propn !
who goes there ?
your friends .
and subjects of the propn .
have a good night .
propn .
have a good - night .
what , is that propn with you ?
a piece of him .
welcome , propn .
welcome , good propn .
tell me , has this thing appeared again tonight ?
i have n ’ t seen anything .
propn says it ’ s all in our imagination , and does n ’ t believe a word we say about this dreaded sight , seen twice by us .
so i ’ ve begged him to come along with us to watch what happens this night , that , if this apparition comes again , he may believe what we have seen and speak to it .
nonsense , nonsense , it will not appear .
sit down awhile , and let us tell you once again , you who is so stubborn in not believing our story , what we have seen these last two nights .
ok , let ’ s sit down , and listen to propn speak of this .
last night , when that star up there , that 's west of the propn propn , had moved around to light that part of the sky where now it burns , propn and myself , the clock ’ s bell then tolling one , propn , stop !
look it ’ s coming again !
it looks just like the dead king !
you ’ re a scholar , speak to it , propn .
does n ’ t it look like the king ?
look at it , propn .
yes , it does .
it fills me with fear and wonder .
it wants to be spoken to .
question it , propn .
what are you , that seizes this time of night , taking the same fair and warlike form in which the dead king of propn , now buried , did sometimes march ?
by propn i order you , speak !
it is offended .
see , it stalks away !
stay !
speak , speak !
i order you to speak !
it is gone , and will not answer us .
what ’ s wrong , propn ?
you tremble and look pale .
is this not more than our imaginations ?
what do you think about it ?
before my propn , i might not believe this thing without the seeing and true testimony of my own eyes .
is n ’ t it like the king ?
as you are to yourself .
it is strange .
it ’ s come twice before , and just appearing out of nothing , he ’ s gone past us at this dead hour with a warlike stalk .
i do n ’ t know what its intentions are , but , in the plainness and freedom of my opinion , this foretells some strange eruption to our state .
who is the man who can explain this to me ?
i can explain it , at least , what ’ s on the grapevine .
i think it can be no other reason but that .
well it may turn out that this warning figure comes armed through our watch , looking so like the king that was and is the question of these wars .
it is a speck of dust to irritate the mind 's eye .
in the most high and palm tree - like state of propn , a little before the mightiest propn propn was killed , the graves had no bodies , and the dead in sheets propn and gibbered in the roman streets , and stars with trains of fire and red morning dews , disasters in the sun .
and like similar forecasters of fierce events , as the advance team before the fates , and prologue to the omen coming on , propn and earth have together demonstrated to our country and countrymen .
look where it comes again !
i ’ ll cross it , though it kill me .
stay , illusion !
stay , and speak !
stop it , propn !
shall i strike at it with my club ?
go ahead , if it will not stand .
it is here !
it is here !
it is gone !
we do it wrong , its being so like the king , to offer it the show of violence , because it is , like the air , unable to be hurt , and our empty blows seem like a malicious joke .
it was about to speak , when the rooster crowed .
and then it seemed startled , like a guilty thing running from a court order .
i have heard the rooster , that is the trumpet of the morning , with his lofty and shrill - sounding throat , awakes the god of day , and , at his warning , whether in sea or fire , in earth or air , the straying and wandering spirit hurries back to his grave .
it faded on the crowing of the rooster .
i ’ ve heard that too , and partly believe it .
but , look , the morning , dressed in a red cape , walks over the dew of that high hill in the east .
let ’ s break up our watch , and i think we should tell all we have seen tonight to young propn , for , i swear on my life , this spirit , silent to us , will speak to him .
do you agree that we shall tell him , because we love him and it is our duty ?
let 's do it , i beg you , and i know exactly where we shall easily find him .
we have not disregarded your good advice , which has freely gone along with this affair .
to all , our thanks .
i will tell you now , as you know , young propn , not thinking very much of us , or thinking that our late dear brother 's death made our country disorganized and no longer powerful , conspiring with this dream of his advantage , has not failed to pester us with messages , asking us to the surrender of those lands lost by his father , within all the rules of law , to our most valiant brother .
so much for him !
now what we have done so far is this .
we have here written to propn , uncle of young propn , who , impotent and bed - rid , knows nothing of his nephew 's intentions , to stop his further progress in this plan because the levies , the lists , and full proportions are all made without his knowledge , and we are sending you , good propn , and you , propn , to take this greeting to old propn , without giving you any further personal power to do business with the king , more than the scope of these detailed items allow .
farewell and hurry to do your duty .
in that and all things , we will show our duty .
we do not doubt it .
heartily , farewell .
and now , propn , what 's the news with you ?
you told us you want something .
what is it , propn ?
you can not start to ask the propn of propn , and then stop .
what do you want , propn , that i shall not my offer before you ask ?
the head is not more native to the heart , the hand more instrumental to the mouth , than is the throne of propn to your father .
what would you ask , propn ?
have you your father 's permission ?
what says propn ?
my lord , he has wrung from me my reluctant permission by asking me again and again , and i finally had to give in .
i do beg you , give him permission to go .
how is it that the clouds still hang on you ?
that ’ s not so , my lord , i am too much in the sun .
propn propn , take off your black looks , and let your eye look on the propn like a friend .
do n ’ t look for your noble father on the ground forever with sad eyes .
yes , madam , that ’ s the way it goes .
if that ’ s the way it goes , why does it seem unusual with you ?
seem ? ” , madam !
no , it is .
for shame !
it is a sin to propn , a sin against the dead , a sin to nature , most ridiculous to reason , whose common theme is death of fathers , and who still has cried , from the first corpse to the man who died just today , ” this must be so . ” we beg you , give up on this unusual grief , and think of us as of a father .
because , let the whole world know , you are the next in line to our throne , and , i give you my love , with no less nobility than the love which the dearest father bears his son .
as for your intentions to go back to school in propn , leaving here is not something that we want , and we beg you to give into remaining here in the happiness and pleasure of our eyes , our most important courtier , cousin , and our son .
do n ’ t let my prayers go unanswered , propn .
i beg you to stay with us , do n ’ t go to propn .
i ’ ll do my best to obey you , madam .
why , it is a loving and a fair reply .
behave as we would in propn .
let ’ s go .
o propn !
o propn !
how weary , stale , flat , and unprofitable all the habits of this world seem to me !
shame on it !
o for shame !
it is an unweeded garden that is going to seed , only things that are decaying and disgusting grow there .
that it should come to this !
only dead for two months !
propn and earth !
must i remember ?
weakness , your name is woman — a little month , even before those shoes with which she followed my poor father 's body were old , she was totally inconsolable , all tears , why she , even she— o propn !
a beast that lacks the gift of reason , would have mourned longer— married my uncle , my father 's brother , but no more like my father than i am like propn .
within a month , before the salt of the most wicked tears had left the redness in her bitter eyes , she married .
o , most wicked speed , to travel with such quickness to incestuous sheets !
it is not good and it can not come to good .
but , break my heart , for i must be silent !
greetings to your lordship !
i am glad to see you well .
or i do forget myself !
it ’ s me , my lord , and your poor servant forever .
and why are you here from propn , propn ?
a lazy disposition , my good lord .
i would n ’ t even hear your enemy say so , and you shall not violently throw those words to my ear , to make my ear the keeper of your own report against yourself .
i know you are not lazy .
but what are you doing in propn ?
we 'll teach you to drink a lot before you leave !
my lord , i came to see your father 's funeral .
please do n ’ t mock me , fellow - student .
i think it was to see my mother 's wedding .
indeed , my lord , it followed very soon after .
thrift , thrift , propn !
the meats baked for the funeral were also put on the marriage tables .
i wish i had met my dearest enemy in propn before i had ever seen that day , propn !
my father … i think i see my father .
where , my lord ?
in my mind 's eye , propn .
he was a man , take him for all in all , i shall not look upon his like again .
my lord , i think i saw him last night .
my lord , the king your father .
the propn my father !
hold off your compliments for awhile and pay attention , until i may deliver , with the witness of these gentlemen , something marvelous to you .
for propn 's love , let me hear what you have to say .
but where was this ?
my lord , on the platform where we watched .
did n ’ t you speak to it ?
my lord , i did , but it made me no answer .
it is very strange .
i swear , my honored lord , it is true , and we thought it was our duty to let you know about it .
are you going to watch again tonight ?
we are , my lord .
he was armed , you say ?
propn , my lord .
from top to toe ?
my lord , from head to foot .
then you did n ’ t see his face ?
o , yes , my lord .
he had the front visor of his helmet up .
what , did he look like he was frowning ?
his face showed more sorrow than anger .
was he pale or red ?
no , very pale .
and he fixed his eyes on you ?
most constantly .
i wish i had been there .
it would have amazed you very much .
i ’ m sure it would ’ ve , i ’ m sure it would ’ ve .
did it stay long ?
as long as an average person might count to a hundred .
longer , longer .
not when i saw it .
his beard was grizzly , no ?
it was , as i have seen it in his life , a silvery sable .
i guarantee it will .
if it takes on my noble father 's appearance , i ’ ll speak to it , though hell itself should open wide and order me to be silent .
i beg you all , if you have kept this sight secret so far , keep your silence still , and whatever else shall happen tonight , take it in , but do n ’ t talk about it .
i will reward your loyalty .
so , goodbye for now .
on the platform , between eleven and twelve , i ’ ll visit you .
our duty to your honor .
your loyalty , as mine to you .
goodbye .
my father 's spirit in arms !
i wish the night were here now !
until then , sit still , my soul .
wicked deeds will rise to be seen even if they are buried very deep in the earth .
the things i need are all on the ship .
goodbye .
and , sister , as the winds will be favorable and the ships are strong to sail , do n ’ t sleep , until you let me hear from you .
do you doubt that ?
as for propn and the foolishness of his attentions , think that it is only a phase and a toy in blood .
nothing more than that ?
stop thinking about it , because nature , the moon , does not grow alone in strength and size , but as this temple grows , the inward duty of the mind and soul grows wide along with the rest .
he may not , as lower persons do , select for himself , for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state , and therefore must his choice be subject to the voice and consent of that state that he is the head of .
then if he says he loves you , you would be wise to believe it because then being in his particular act and place may do what he says , which is what the majority of people in of propn go along with .
so decide what loss your honor may receive if you listen to his songs with a too believing ear , or lose your heart , or lose your virginity to his wild sense of bad timing .
fear it , propn , fear it , my dear sister , and keep your affections deep within you , out of the range and danger of desire .
the most careful maid is wasteful enough if she unmasks her beauty to the moon .
virtue itself does n ’ t aim at lying deeds .
an ugly disease afflicts the new flowers of the spring too often before they have bloomed , and in the morning and liquid dew of youth contagious shriveling is the most imminent .
youth rebels against itself , even if no one else is near .
i shall keep the purpose of this good lesson as watchman to my heart .
but , my good brother , do n ’ t , as some insincere ministers do , show me the steep and thorny way to propn , while , like a proud and reckless wild man , preaches against the primrose path of sin and does not practice what he preaches .
o , do n ’ t be afraid of me .
i ’ ve stayed too long .
but here comes my father .
a double blessing is a double grace , it ’ s a better occasion to smile at saying goodbye again .
you ’ re still here , laertes !
aboard , aboard , for shame !
the wind sits in the best part of your sail , and the ship waits for you .
there , my blessing with you !
and see that you write these few precepts in your memory .
give your thoughts to yourself , and do n ’ t act without thinking .
be friendly , but by no means vulgar .
those friends you have , and their friendship tested , propn them to your soul with hoops of steel , but do n ’ t spend your money on entertaining each newly acquired , unproven friend .
beware of getting into a quarrel , but , once you are in , fight so that the man you fight with may beware of you .
this above all , to your own self be true , and it must follow , as the night the day , you can not then be false to any man .
goodbye .
my blessing instill these things in you !
i take my leave most humbly , my lord .
propn , propn , and remember well what i have said to you .
it is locked in my memory , and you yourself shall keep the key of it .
goodbye .
what is it , propn , that he has said to you ?
if it pleases you , something touching the propn propn .
by propn , well thought .
what is going on between you ?
tell me the truth .
my lord , he has of late made many offers of his affection to me .
affection !
pooh !
you speak like a green girl , propn in such dangerous circumstances .
do you believe his “ offers , ” as you call them ?
my lord , i do n ’ t know what i should think .
by propn , i ’ ll teach you .
think that you are a baby , that you have taken these offers for true love , which are not true offers .
consider yourself more dearly , or , not to keep harping on that poor phrase , doing harm to it , you 'll “ offer ” me a fool !
my lord , he has courted me with love in honorable fashion .
and has given proper appearance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of propn .
yes , mousetraps to catch fools .
i do know , when passion burns the blood , how the wasteful soul gives the tongue vows to speak .
these blazes , daughter , giving more light than heat , dead in both , even in their promises , dying as they are being made , must not be taken for real fire .
as for propn propn , only believe so much about him , that he is young , and he may walk on a higher mountain than may be given you .
in short , propn , do n ’ t believe his vows , because they are pimps , not made of those things which show outside , but mere beggars of unholy courtships , breathing like holy and righteous procurers , the better to deceive you .
do as i say , i order you .
let ’ s go .
i shall obey , my lord .
the air bites sharply , it is very cold .
it is a nipping and an eager air .
what time is it now ?
i think it ’ s just before twelve .
no , the clock has already struck twelve .
indeed ?
i did n ’ t hear it .
then it ’ s getting close to the time when the spirit has his habit of walking .
what does that mean , my lord ?
the propn stays awake tonight and has a drinking party , propn toasting , and the swaggering morning whirls , and , as he drinks down his drafts of propn wine , the kettle - drum and trumpet thus noisily announce the triumph of his drinking it all down at once .
is it a custom ?
yes , by propn , it is , but to my mind , though i am a native here , and know the customs since birth , it is a custom more honored in the braking it than the observing it .
so often it might happen in particular men that , for some vicious disfigurement of nature in them , like a birthmark— something they are not guilty of because a man can not choose how he is born— by the overdevelopment of some temperament , that often defies the intelligent use of reason , or by some habit , that too much exceeds the limits of acceptable behavior , that these men , carrying , i say , the stamp of one defect , being the result of nature , or a star of fortune , whatever other virtues they have , even if they are as pure as grace , as infinite as men may have , propn in the general opinion be labeled corrupt from that one particular fault .
the drop of affliction often causes doubt about all the virtues they have to men ’ s own disgrace .
look , my lord , it comes !
angels and ministers of grace defend us !
whether you are a spirit of health or a goblin damned , bringing with you airs from propn or blasts from hell , whether your intentions are wicked or charitable , you come in such a questionable shape that i will speak to you .
o , answer me !
do n ’ t let me burst in ignorance , but tell me why your sacred bones , buried in death , have escaped from the cemetery , why the tomb wherein we saw you quietly laid to rest , has opened his frightening and marble jaws to bring you back to life !
what does this mean , that you , dead corpse , again in full armor , revisit us in the light and shadows of the moon , making night hideous , and making us fools of nature shake our dispositions so horridly with thoughts that go beyond the reaches of our souls ?
say , why is this ?
why ?
what should we do ?
it beckons you to go away with it , as if it had something to say to you alone .
look with what courteous action it waves you to a more private ground .
but do n ’ t go with it !
no , by no means .
if it will not speak , then i will follow it .
do n ’ t , my lord .
why , what should i be afraid of ?
i do n ’ t value my life at the price of a pin , and as for my soul , what can it do to that , being a thing that is immortal as it is ?
it waves me forward again .
i ’ ll follow it .
what if it tempts you toward the ocean , my lord , or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that hangs so threateningly over his base into the sea , and once there , assumes some other horrible form which might deprive you of the ability to think , and draw you into madness ?
think about it .
the very place puts desperate ideas , without any motive , into every brain that looks so many fathoms into the sea and hears it roar beneath .
it waves me still .
go on , i ’ ll follow you .
you shall not go , my lord .
hold off your hands .
listen to me : you shall not go .
my fate cries out , and makes each and every vein in this body as hardy as the nerve of the lion killed by propn .
by propn , i ’ ll make a ghost of him that holds me back !
i say , get away from me !
he ’ s getting crazy with expectation !
let ’ s do it .
what will all this lead to ?
something is rotten in the state of propn .
propn will guide its course .
no , let 's follow him .
where will you lead me ?
speak !
i ’ ll go no further .
listen to me .
i will .
do n ’ t pity me , but listen seriously to what i shall disclose to you .
speak , i am obliged to listen .
so you are obliged to revenge , when you shall hear me .
what ?
i am your father 's spirit , doomed for a certain time to walk the night , and during the day i am confined to burn in fires , until the evil crimes i had done in my life are burnt and purged away .
if i were not forbidden to tell the secrets of my prison house , i could tell a tale whose lightest word would crush your soul , freeze your young blood , make your two eyes , like stars , jump from their sockets , your knotted and combined hair to separate , and each particular hair to stand on end like quills on the angry porcupine .
but this eternal description must not be given to ears of flesh and blood .
listen , listen , o , listen !
if you ever loved your dear father — o propn !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
murder !
murder most foul , as even at best it is still murder , but this murder is the most foul , strange , and unnatural .
tell me about it quickly , so that i , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love , may rush to my revenge .
i find you ready , and if you were duller than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on the river bank , you would n ’ t move on this .
now , propn , listen .
the story goes that , sleeping in my orchard , a serpent bit me .
o my prophetic soul !
my uncle !
o propn , what a falling - off there was in our marriage !
but as virtue can never be moved , it was courted though lewdness in a shape of propn , and lust , though linked to a radiant angel , will satisfy itself in a heavenly bed and eat garbage .
but wait !
o , horrible !
o , horrible !
most horrible !
but , however you pursue this revenge , do n ’ t taint your mind , or let your soul plan anything against your mother .
leave her to propn , and to those thorns that live in her bosom , to prick and sting her .
propn now !
the glowworm shows the morning is near , and he begins to put out his ineffective fire .
goodbye , goodbye !
propn , remember me .
o all you host of propn !
o earth !
what else ?
and shall i join forces hell ?
o , for shame !
remember you !
yes , you poor ghost , while memory holds a seat in this confused world .
remember you !
yes , from the table of my memory i ’ ll wipe away all unimportant records , all kinds of books , all pictures , all pressures past , that my youth and observations wrote there , and your commandment all by itself shall live within the book and volume of my brain , unmixed with other low thoughts .
yes , by propn !
o most pernicious woman !
o villain , villain , smiling , damned villain !
my papers , it is just that i set it all down , that one may smile , and smile , and be a villain , at least , i am sure , it may be so in propn .
so , uncle , there you are .
now to my word : it is propn , goodbye !
remember me .
i have sworn it .
so be it !
hello , ho , ho , my lord !
hello , ho , ho , boy !
come , bird , come .
how are you , my noble lord ?
what news , my lord ?
o , wonderful !
my good lord , tell it .
no , you 'll reveal it .
not i , my lord , by propn .
nor i , my lord .
what do you say then , would heart of man once think it ?
and you 'll keep it secret ?
yes , by propn , my lord .
there 's never a villain dwelling in all propn except that he 's an arrant knave .
we do n ’ t need a ghost , my lord , to come from the grave to tell us this .
these are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
i ’ m sorry they offend you , heartily , yes , indeed , heartily .
there 's no offense , my lord .
yes , by propn propn , but there is , propn , and much offense too .
regarding this vision here , it is an honest ghost , that i can tell you .
as for your desire to know what happened between us , control it the best you can .
and now , good friends , as you are friends , scholars , and soldiers , give me one poor request .
what is it , my lord ?
we will .
never make known what you have seen tonight .
my lord , we will not .
no , but swear it .
really , my lord , i would not .
nor i , my lord , really .
swear on my sword .
we have sworn , my lord , already .
indeed , on my sword , indeed .
swear .
are you there , trusty fellow ?
come on !
tell us the oath , my lord .
swear .
you are everywhere ?
then we 'll move our ground .
come over here , gentlemen , and lay your hands again on my sword .
never to speak of what you have heard , swear by my sword .
swear .
well said , old mole !
can you work in the earth so fast ?
a worthy pioneer !
once more , leave , good friends .
o day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore , as a stranger , welcome it .
there are more things in propn and earth , propn , than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
swear .
rest , rest , irritated spirit !
let ’ s go in together , and still keeping your silence , i beg you .
the time is so out of whack .
o cursed spite , that ever i was born to set it right !
no , come , let 's go together .
give him this money and these notes , propn .
i will , my lord .
you would do very well , good propn , before you visit him , to ask someone about his behavior .
my lord , i did intend to ask .
by propn , well said , very well said .
look here , sir , propn ask what danes are in propn , and how , and who , what means , and where they live , what company , at what expense , and finding , by this talking around and drift of questions , that they who do know my son , come nearer to you than your particular questions will touch it .
assume , as it were , that you have only heard about him , such as , “ i know his father and his friends , and in part him ” , are you listening to me , propn ?
yes , very well , my lord .
and in part him , but , ” you may say , “ not very well .
as gaming , my lord .
yes , or drinking , fencing , swearing , quarrelling , propn .
you may go that far .
my lord , that would dishonor him .
just as you mention it in the charge .
you must not put another scandal on him , that he is open to inconstancy .
just tell his faults so quaintly that they may seem to be the stains of freedom , the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind , a savageness in wild blood , an attack that everyone goes through .
but , my good lord , why should you do this ?
yes , my lord , i want to know that .
by propn , sir , here 's my intention : , and i believe it is a trick of protection .
and then , sir , ask if he does this , does he -- what was i about to say ?
so , using my lecture and advice from before , you shall check on my son .
you understand me , yes ?
my lord , i do .
my good lord !
observe his inclinations in yourself .
i shall , my lord .
and let him practice his music .
well , my lord .
goodbye !
alas , my lord , i have been so frightened !
by what , in the name of propn ?
my lord , as i was sewing in my chamber , propn propn , with his shirt all unbuttoned , no hat upon his head , his stockings dirty , not pulled up , and fallen down around his ankles , propn as his shirt , his knees knocking together , and with a look so pitiful in its meaning as if he had been freed out of hell to speak of horrors , he comes before me .
propn for your love ?
my lord , i do n ’ t know , but i truly fear it .
what did he say ?
he took me by the wrist , and held me hard , then he went to the length of his whole arm , and with his other hand like this over his brow , he started such study of my face as though he wanted to draw it .
come , go with me .
i will look for the king .
this is the very passion of love whose violent property kills itself , and leads the will to desperate undertakings as often as any passion under propn that afflicts our natures .
no , my good lord , but , as you did command , i did reject his letters and denied his access to me .
that has made him crazy .
i am sorry that i did n ’ t treat him with better heed and propn .
i was afraid he was only trifling with you and meant to wreck you , but curse my jealousy !
it seems it is as proper for our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion .
come , let ’ s go to the king .
this must be known , which , if kept secret , might mean more trouble to hide it than hate for utter love .
welcome , dear propn and propn !
in addition to the fact that we have wanted to see you for a long time , the reason we need to see you made us send our hasty invitation .
what the problem should be , more than his father 's death that has put him so much from the understanding of himself , i can not dream of .
i beg you both that , being childhood friends and brought up with him , and since you know well his youth and disposition , that you will be pleased to rest here in our court for a while , so that , with your company , you draw him on to enjoy himself , and to gather , so much as from any occasion you may glean , whether anything , unknown to us , afflicts him like this , that , once we know , we can make better .
good gentlemen , he has much talked of you , and i am sure that there are not living two men with whom he feels close .
if you will please show us so much gentry and goodwill as to spend your time with us a while , to help us find out what is troubling him , your visit shall receive such thanks as only a king can give .
both your majesties propn , by the sovereign power you have of us , put your huge request more into a command than to an entreaty .
we both obey , and here we give up ourselves , without reservation , to lay our service freely at your feet , to be commanded .
thanks , propn and gentle propn .
thanks , guildenstern and gentle propn .
and i beg you instantly to visit my too much changed son .
go , some of you , and bring these gentlemen where propn is .
may the heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him !
yes , amen !
the ambassadors from propn , my good lord , are joyfully returned .
you have always been the father of good news .
have i , my lord ?
i assure you , my good lord , i believe my duty is , as i believe in my soul , both to my propn and to my gracious king .
and i do think— or else this brain of mine does n ’ t know the trail of policy as surely as it used to do— , that i have found the very cause of propn 's lunacy .
introduce yourself to them , and bring them in .
he tells me , my sweet queen , he has found the head and source of all your son 's unhappiness .
i doubt it is none other than the main reason , his father 's death and our overly hasty marriage .
well , we shall figure him out .
welcome , my good friends !
say , propn , what news from our ally , propn ?
we really like this news , and later when we have more time we 'll read this request , answer , and think upon this business .
in the meantime , we thank you for a job well done .
get some rest , tonight we 'll feast together .
a great welcome home !
this business is well ended .
propn ” i call it , because to define true craziness , what is it except to be nothing else but crazy ?
but ignore that .
propn , i swear i use no clever words at all .
it remains like this , and the remainder like this .
consider .
i have a daughter , have while she is mine , who , in her duty and obedience , listen , has given me this .
now listen and understand .
you may doubt you that the stars are fire , ” you may doubt that the sun does move , ” you may doubt truth to be a liar , ” but never doubt i love .
o dear propn , i am sick at the number of my sighs , i do n ’ t have the skill to calculate my groans .
but that i love you best , o most best , believe it .
propn .
yours evermore , most dear lady , while this brain is in him , propn .
this my daughter has shown this to me in obedience , and furthermore , has his gifts , which she has described to me by the time , by means , and place they were received .
but how has she received his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a man faithful and honorable .
i would gladly prove so .
do you think it is this ?
it may be , very likely .
has there been such a time , i ’ d gladly know that , that i have positively said “ it is so , ” and it was n ’ t ?
not that i know of .
take this from this , if this is n ’ t the case now .
if get the opportunity , i will find where truth is hidden , though it were hidden indeed within the centre of the man .
how can we find out more ?
you know sometimes he walks for hours and hours here in the lobby .
so he does indeed .
at such a time , i ’ ll make sure my daughter meets him .
you and i will be behind a curtain then , listening to their encounter .
if he does n ’ t love her , and he ’ s not gone crazy because of love , let me be no assistant for a state , but be a farmer and horse carter .
we will try it .
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading .
o , give me permission .
how does my good propn propn ?
well , propn have mercy .
do you know me , my lord ?
not i , my lord .
then i wish you were so honest a man .
honest , my lord !
that 's very true , my lord .
for if the sun breeds maggots in a dead dog , being a god - kissing rotten flesh— have you a daughter ?
i have , my lord .
let her not walk in the sun .
pregnancy is a blessing , but not as your daughter may get pregnant .
friend , look to it .
how say you by that ?
still harping on my daughter .
he is far gone , far gone !
in my youth i truly suffered much agony for love almost like this .
words , words , words .
what is the matter , my lord ?
between who ?
i mean , the matter that you are reading , my lord .
all of which , sir , although i believe it most powerfully and potently , yet i think it was dishonest to have written it like this , because you yourself , sir , should be old as i am , if , like a crab , you could go backward .
into my grave ?
indeed , that is out of the air .
aside .
how full of meaning his replies sometimes are !
a happiness that often craziness hits on , which reason and sanity could n ’ t arranged so happily .
you can not , sir , take from me anything that i will more willingly part with , except my life , except my life , except my life .
goodbye , my lord .
these tedious old fools !
propn save you , sir !
my honored lord !
my most dear lord !
my excellent good friends !
how are you , guildenstern ?
ah , propn !
good lads , how do you both ?
as the indifferent children of the earth .
nor the soles of her shoe ?
neither , my lord .
then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
propn , we are her privates .
in the secret parts of fortune ?
what 's the news ?
none , my lord , but that the world 's grown honest .
prison , my lord !
propn 's a prison .
then the world is one .
a goodly one , in which there are many cells , wards , and dungeons , propn being one of the worst .
we do n ’ t think so , my lord .
why , then it is not a prison to you , for there is nothing either good or bad but only thinking makes it so .
to me , it is a prison .
o propn , i could be put into a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space , if it were not that i have bad dreams .
those dreams are indeed ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
a dream itself is but a shadow .
truly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow 's shadow .
then our beggars are bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes are the beggars ' shadows .
shall we to the court ?
for , by my faith , i can not reason .
we 'll wait upon you .
that ’ s not necessary .
i wo n ’ t sort you with the rest of my servants , because , to speak to you like an honest man , i am most dreadfully attended .
but , in the beaten way of friendship , what are you doing at propn ?
to visit you , my lord , no other occasion .
beggar that i am , i am even poor in thanks , but i thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are a halfpenny too expensive .
were n ’ t you sent for ?
is it your own desire to come here ?
is it a free visit ?
come on , tell me the truth .
what should we say , my lord ?
why , anything but to the answer .
you were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks , which you are not very good at hiding .
i know the good king and queen have sent for you .
what for , my lord ?
you have to tell me .
but let me beg you , by the rights of our fellowship , by the harmony of our youth , by the obligation of our ever preserved love , and by anything else that could charge you to be even and direct with me , were you were sent for or not ?
what do you say ?
my lord , we were sent for .
i have of late , but why i do n ’ t know , lost all my joy , given up all habits of exercises , and indeed , i am so depressed that this good frame , the earth , seems to me to be a sterile outpost , this most excellent canopy , the air— look— , this brave sky hanging over us , this majestic roof divided with golden fire , why , it seems to me to be nothing but a dirty and disgusting meeting of vapors .
what a piece of work is man !
how noble in reason !
how infinite in faculties !
in form and moving , how expressive and admirable !
in action how like an angel !
in understanding , how like a god !
and yet , to me , what is this highly refined speck of dust ?
man does n ’ t delight me , no , nor woman either , though by your smiling , you seem to find that funny .
my lord , there was n ’ t any such stuff in my thoughts .
why did you laugh then , when i said , “ man does n ’ t delight me ” ?
to think , my lord , if you do not delight in man , what a somber reception the players shall receive from you .
we passed them on the way , and they are coming here to perform .
what players are they ?
even those you usually enjoy , the tragedians of the city .
how is it that they travel ?
being in the city was better for them in regards to their reputation and their profits .
i think their traveling to perform a play is a new innovation .
do they hold the same respect they did when i was in the city ?
are they still followed ?
no , indeed , they are not .
why ?
do they grow rusty ?
no , their work keeps them at their usual pace , but there is , sir , a brood of children , untrained , that complicate their situation , and are most tyrannically beaten for it .
children are now very popular , and are on the common stages , as they call them , so much that many actors are afraid they can not compete and barely dare to come there .
what , are they children ?
who cares for them ?
where do they live ?
will they stop pursuing the stage when they can no longer sing ?
wo n ’ t they say later , if they should go on to become common players , which is likely , and their lives are no better , that their writers did them wrong to make them exclaim against their own success ?
well , there has been a lot of comment on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to provoke them to controversy .
there was , for a while , no money paid for debate unless the poet and the player fought over the question .
is it possible ?
o , there has been a lot of bashing of brains going on .
do the boys carry them away ?
yes , they do , my lord , propn and his load too .
it is not very strange , for my uncle is king of propn , and those that would make faces at him while my father lived , paid twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats each for a little picture of him .
propn ’ s blood ! , there is something more than natural in this , if philosophy could figure it out .
there are the players .
gentlemen , you are welcome to propn .
let me shake your hands .
the accessory of a welcome is fashion and ceremony .
let me comply with it in these clothes , for fear that my welcome to the players , which i tell you must look good , should more appear like entertainment than your plays .
you are welcome .
but my uncle - father and aunt- mother are deceived .
in what , my dear lord ?
i am but crazy north - north - west .
when the wind is from the south , i know a hawk from a handsaw .
welcome , gentlemen !
listen , guildenstern , and you too , with each ear .
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clothes .
happily this is the second time he uses them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
i predict he comes to tell me of the players , listen .
you say right , sir .
on propn morning , it was true indeed .
buzz , buzz !
seneca can not be too heavy nor propn too light .
for the law of writ and the liberty , these are the only men .
o propn , judge of propn , what a treasure you had !
what treasure did he have , my lord ?
why , “ one fair daughter , and no more , the which he loved passing well . ” still harping on my daughter .
am i not in the right , old propn ?
if you call me propn , my lord , i have a daughter that i love passing well .
no , that does n ’ t follow .
what follows , then , my lord ?
why , “ as by lot , propn knows , ” and then , you know , ” it came to pass , as most like it was . ” the first line of the holy song will show you more , for look where my means of whiling away the time comes .
you are welcome , masters , welcome , all .
i am glad to see you well .
welcome , good friends .
what , my young lady and mistress !
by our lady , your ladyship is taller than when i saw you last , by the height of a high - heeled shoe .
pray propn , your voice , like a an unused gold coin , ca n ’ t be cracked within the ring .
masters , you are all welcome .
we 'll act up like french falconers : fly at anything we see .
we 'll have a speech right now .
come , give us a bit of your quality .
come , a passionate speech .
what speech , my lord ?
i heard you do a speech once , but it was never acted , or if it was , not more than once , for the play , i remember , did n ’ t please the crowd , it was caviar to the particular , but it was , as i took it , and others , whose judgments in such matters far exceed mine , an excellent play , well organized in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as skill .
i remember , one said there were no mixes in the lines to make the matter spicy , and no matter in the phrase that might accuse the author of putting on airs , but called it an honest effort , as wholesome as it was sweet , and , by very much , more handsome than fine .
if you can remember it , begin at this line , let me see , let me see .
by propn , my lord , well spoken , with good accent and good judgment .
eventually he finds him , striking too short at the propn .
his old sword , rebelling against his arm , lies where it falls , resisting his commands .
not matched equally , propn lunges at propn , strikes wild in rage , but , with the whiff and wind of his fierce sword , the shaken father falls .
then senseless propn , seeming to feel this blow , flaming at his top stoops to his base , and , with a hideous crash , cuts off prisoner propn ' ear .
behold !
his sword , which was declining on the milky head of reverend propn , seemed in the air to stick .
so , like a painted tyrant , propn stood , and , as if not giving in to his will and body , did nothing .
but , as we often see a silence in the heavens , after some storm , the gales stand still , the bold winds speechless , and the earth below propn hushed as death , and eventually the dreadful thunder tears the region , so , after propn ' pause , a roused anger renews him and he begins to work , and never did the one - eyed monster ’ s hammers fall on the god of war ’ s amour , forged for eternal strength , with less sorrow than propn ' bleeding sword now falls on propn .
out , out , you loose woman , propn !
all you gods , in general meeting , take away her power , break all the spokes and curved rims from her wheel , and bowl the hub of the wheel down the hill of propn , as low as you can to kill the fiends !
this is too long .
it shall go to the barber 's , to be cut with your beard .
i beg you , continue .
he 's for a jig or a dirty tale , or he sleeps .
continue , come to propn .
wrapped up queen ” is good .
run barefoot up and down , threatening the flames with blind tears , a cloth on that head where lately the crown had stood , and for a robe , about her thin loins , exhausted from child - bearing , a blanket , caught up in the panic of fear , whoever had seen this , with a very poisoned tongue , would have pronounced treason against propn 's state .
but if the gods themselves saw her then , when she saw propn make malicious sport by chopping her husband ’ s limbs with his sword , the instant burst of noise that she made , unless mortal events ca n ’ t move them at all , would have made the burning eyes of propn milk , and rouse passion in the gods .
look , where he has turned pale , and has tears in his eyes .
i beg you , no more !
it is well .
i ’ ll have you speak out the rest of this soon .
my good lord , will you see the players well taken care of ?
do you hear me ?
let them be well used , for they are the short stories and brief history of the time .
after you die , it would be better to have a bad epitaph then than their ill report while you live now .
my lord , i will use them according to their class .
propn ’ s bodkin , man , better .
use every man according to his class , and who should escape whipping ?
use them according to your class .
the less they deserve it , the more credit it is to you .
take them in .
come , sirs .
follow him , friends .
we 'll hear a play tomorrow .
do you hear me , old friend ?
we 'll have it tomorrow night .
yes , my lord .
very well .
follow that lord , and see you do n ’ t mock him .
i ’ ll leave you till night .
you are welcome to propn .
my good lord !
yes , so , propn be with you !
now i am alone .
o , what a idle , wandering , and peasant slave i am !
is n ’ t it monstrous that this actor here , only in a play , in a dream of passion , could force his soul so to his own actions that his grew pale from the words of the speech , tears in his eyes , separation from reality in his face , a broken voice , and his whole function matching forms to his role ?
and all for nothing !
for propn ?
what 's propn to him , or he to propn , that he should weep for her ?
what would he do if he had the motive and the cue for passion that i have ?
he would drown the stage with tears and split the audience ’ s with horrid speech , make the guilty crazy , and shock the innocent , propn the ignorant , and amaze , indeed , the very faculties of eyes and ears .
am i a coward ?
who calls me villain ?
breaks my head across ?
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
tweaks me by the nose ?
lies about me in the throat as deep as the lungs ?
bloody , bawdy villain !
remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
o , vengeance !
why , what an ass i am !
this is most brave , that i , the son of a dear father murdered , prompted to my revenge by propn and hell , must , like a whore , release the content of my heart with words , and fall down cursing like a very drab , propn servant in the kitchen !
shame on it !
argh !
change course , my brain !
i have heard that guilty creatures , sitting at a play , have been so struck to the soul by the very cunning of the scene that presently they have confessed their evil deeds , because murder , although it is silent , will speak with its own most miraculous organ , i ’ ll have these propn play something like the murder of my father before my uncle .
i ’ ll observe his looks , i ’ ll watch his every move .
even if he only winks , i know what i have to do .
i ’ ll need to have more proof than this .
the play 's the thing wherein i ’ ll see the conscience of the king .
and ca n ’ t you , by any circumstance , get from him why he puts on this craziness , grating all his days of quiet so harshly with turbulence and dangerous lunacy ?
he does confess that he feels himself troubled , but he will by no means speak about the cause .
nor do we find him easy to figure out the reason why , because , with a crafty craziness , keeps his distance when we try to bring him to some confession of his true state .
did he receive you well ?
most like a gentleman .
but with much forcing to make himself do it .
difficult to question , but , when we ask for something , he is most free in his reply .
did you try to get him to engage in any pastime ?
propn , it just so happened that certain players we passed on the way here .
we told him about them , and it seemed to make him happy to hear of it .
they are here at the court , and , i think , they are already hired to play before him tonight .
this is very true , and he begged me to invite your majesties to hear and see the play .
with all my heart , and it makes me happy to hear that he is so inclined .
good gentlemen , cut him some slack , and keep his attentions on these delights .
we shall , my lord .
propn propn , leave us too , for we have secretly sent for propn to come here , that here he may , as if by accident propn propn .
her father and i , lawful spies , will so hide ourselves that , seeing but unseen , we may honestly judge their encounter , and gather from him , or how he behaves , if it ’ s the affliction of his love or not that he suffers like this for .
i really hope your virtues will bring him to his usual way again , to the honor of both of you .
propn , i wish it may .
propn , you walk here .
gracious king , if it pleases you , we will bestow ourselves .
read this book , showing that such an exercise may colours your loneliness .
we are often to blame in this , it ’ s been proven often , that with devotion 's face and holy actions , we sugar over the propn himself .
o , it is too true !
how hurting a lash that speech gives my conscience !
the prostitute 's cheek , covered with makeup , is n ’ t more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my very artificial words .
o heavy burden !
i hear him coming .
let 's hide , my lord .
there 's the respect that makes a mess of long life , for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's insults , the pangs of rejected love , the law 's delay , the inexperience of office , and the disdain that patient merit takes from the unworthy , when he himself might his final settlement make with a bare , sharp knife ?
who would bear these burdens to grunt and sweat under a weary life , except that the dread of something after death , the undiscovered country , from whose borders no traveler returns , puzzles the mind , and makes us bear those problems we have rather than fly to others that we do n ’ t know about ?
in this way , a conscience can make cowards of us all , and in this way the natural color of making up your mind is covered with the pale shadow of thinking , and projects of great substance and significance , and in this regard , their movement turns erratic , and lose the name of action .
wait !
the fair propn !
propn , in your eyes may all my sins be remembered .
my good lord , how has your honor been for this many a day ?
i humbly thank you , well , well , well .
my lord , i have mementos of yours that i have longed to re - deliver to you for a long time .
i beg you , take them back now .
my honored lord , you know right well you did , and with them , words composed of so sweet an air as made the things more rich .
their sweet air being gone , take them back again , because to the noble mind propn gifts grow poor when the givers prove unkind .
there , my lord .
are you sincere ?
my lord ?
are you truthful ?
what do you mean ?
that if you be sincere and truthful , your sincerity should n ’ t have any talks to your beauty .
could beauty , my lord , have better dealings than with sincerity ?
yes , truly , for the power of beauty will transform sincerity from what it is to a pimp faster than the force of sincerity can translate beauty into his image .
this used to be contradictory , but now the time proves it ’ s true .
i did love you once .
indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
you should not have believed me , for virtue ca n ’ t graft a new plant onto our old stock but we shall relish of it .
i did n ’ t love you .
i was deceived all the more .
get yourself to a convent .
why would you give birth to sinners ?
i do n ’ t care about my sincerity , but i could accuse myself of such things that it were better my mother had not had me .
i am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offenses at my command than i have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to commit them in .
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and propn ?
we are wicked men , all , believe none of us .
take yourself a convent .
where 's your father ?
at home , my lord .
shut the doors on him , that he may play the fool nowhere else but in his own house .
goodbye .
o , help him , you sweet heavens !
if you do , by propn , i ’ ll give you this curse for your wedding gift : whether you as chaste as ice , as pure as snow , you shalt not escape slander .
go to a convent , go .
goodbye .
or , if you will marry , make it a fool , by propn , for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them .
to a convent , go , and quickly too .
goodbye .
o heavenly powers , restore him !
you dance , you walk , and you whisper and nickname animals , and make your looseness your ignorance .
i say , we will have no more marriages .
those that are married already , all but one , shall live , the rest stay the same .
to a convent , go .
o , what a noble mind here is conquered !
the courtier 's , scholar 's , soldier 's , eye , voice , sword , the hope and flower of propn , the mirror of fashion and the mold of perfect form , the observed of all observers , quite , quite taken down !
and i of all ladies most dejected and wretched that has tasted the honey of his musical vows , now see that noble and most royal mind , like sweet bells jangling , out of tune and harsh to hear , that form and feature of blown youth without equal totally crazy .
o , woe is me , to have seen the man i have seen , see the man i see !
love !
his affections do n ’ t go that way , and what he said , though it was a little unorganized , was n ’ t like craziness .
there 's something in his soul over which his depression sits like a bird on an egg , and i doubt that egg will hatch and the “ bird ” will be something dangerous , which to prevent , i have quickly decided to write it down like this .
happily the seas , and different countries with other things , shall cure and get rid of this problem in his heart that has such a hold on him , which his still active brain makes him like this from being himself .
what do you think about it ?
it ’ ll be ok .
but i still believe the source and beginning of his grief began with rejected love .
how are you , propn !
my lord , do as you please , but if you think it ’ s ok , after the play , let his queen mother talk to him all alone and beg him to share his problem .
let her be strict with him , and i ’ ll be hide , if it pleases you , so i can hear of all their conference .
if she ca n ’ t find out what ’ s wrong , then send him to propn , or lock him up where you think is the best place .
that ’ s what i ’ ll do .
craziness in great ones must not go unwatched .
speak the part , i beg you , as i read it to you , lightly on your tongue .
but if you just repeat it , as many actors do , i would prefer the town crier spoke my lines .
o , it offends me to the soul to hear a hefty fellow with a wig tear an emotion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the cheap seats , who , for the most part , are capable of nothing but confusing pantomime and noise .
please avoid it .
i assure you .
but do n ’ t be too tame either , but let your own discretion be your teacher .
fit the action to the word , the word to the action , with this special rule , that you do n ’ t overstep the simplicity of being natural , for anything so overdone is not the purpose of playing , whose end , both at the first and now , was and is , to hold , as it were , the mirror up to nature , to show truth in reality , scorn her falseness , and his form and force to the very age and body of the time .
now , this overacting , or lateness , though it make the ignorant laugh , can only make the experienced grieve , in whose opinion , you must outdo a whole theatre of other audiences in your performance .
o , there are actors that i have seen perform and heard others praise , and highly too , not to speak too harshly , that , having neither the accent of propn , nor the walk of a propn , a pagan , or a man , have so strutted and yelled that i have thought some of nature 's hired help had made them and not made them well , they imitated mankind so dreadfully .
i hope we have calmly overcome those problems , sir .
o , overcome them with zeal .
that 's horrible and shows very bad manners in the fool that uses it .
go get ready .
how are you , my lord !
will the king hear this piece of work ?
and the queen too , and they should be here presently .
we will , my lord .
what , here , propn !
here , sweet lord , at your service .
propn , you are just like the man that my conversation just now praised .
why should the poor be flattered ?
no , let the sweet tongue lick ridiculous vain glory , and bend the obvious hinges of the knee where poverty may follow flattery .
do you hear me ?
since my dear soul controlled her choice , and could recognize men of truth , her choice has taken you for herself .
because you have been as one , that in suffering all , that suffers nothing , a man that propn 's feasts and rewards have taken with equal thanks , and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well blended that they are not an instrument for propn 's finger to play whatever song she pleases .
give me that man that is not passion 's slave , and i will wear him in my heart 's core , yes , in my heart of heart , as i do you .
ok , enough of that .
there is a play tonight before the king .
one scene of it comes near the circumstances , which i have told you , of my father 's death .
i beg you , when you see that act begin , even with the very criticism of your soul watch my uncle .
if his hidden guilt do n ’ t show itself in that one speech , it is a false ghost that we have seen , and my imaginations are as unstable as god of fire ’ s anvil .
watch him carefully , because i will have my eyes riveted on his face , and , after the play , we will combine our observations in condemning of his actions .
well , my lord .
if he steals anything the while this play is going on , and he escapes detection , i will pay for the theft .
they are coming to the play .
i must be idle .
go get yourself a seat .
how ’ s our cousin propn ?
excellent , really , of the chameleon 's dish .
i eat the air , crammed with promises .
you ca n ’ t eat capons that way .
no , for me now .
my lord , you acted once when you were in the university , you say ?
that did i , my lord , and i was accounted a good actor .
what did you enact ?
i did enact propn propn , i was killed in the propn , propn killed me .
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a stupid fellow there .
are the players ready ?
come hear , my dear propn , sit by me .
o , ho !
do you see that ?
propn , shall i lie in your lap ?
no , my lord .
i mean , lay my head on your lap ?
yes , my lord .
do you think i meant sexual matters ?
i think nothing , my lord .
that 's a fair thought to lie between maids ' legs .
what is , my lord ?
nothing .
you are merry , my lord .
who , me ?
yes , my lord .
o , your only dancer !
what should a man do but be merry ?
because look how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
no , it is four months , my lord .
so long ?
no then , let the devil wear black , for i ’ ll have a suit of black fur .
o heavens !
died two months ago and not forgotten yet ?
by propn , this is miching mallecho , it means mischief .
it ’ s as if this show describes the argument of the play .
we shall know by this fellow .
the players can not keep a secret , they 'll tell all .
will he tell us what this show meant ?
yes , or any show that you 'll show him .
if you are not ashamed to show , he wo n ’ t be ashamed to tell you what it means .
keep quiet , keep quiet .
i ’ ll watch the play .
for us and for our tragedy , here stooping to your clemency , we beg you listen patiently .
is this a prologue or a ring of flowers ?
it is short , my lord .
as woman 's love .
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us count again before love is finished !
that i do n ’ t trust you .
now , you know how i love you has been proven to you , and as my love is can not be measured , so is my fear .
where love is great , the littlest doubts are very fearful , where little fears grow great , great love also grows there .
such love must be treason in my breast .
let me be cursed if i marry again !
no one marries the second without killing the first love .
the reasons for a second marriage are low respects of saving money , but not for love .
i kill my husband dead a second time when second husband kisses me in bed .
i believe you believe what you say now , but what we determine to , often we do n ’ t .
promises are only good when you remember them , born of violence but poor truth , which now , like unripe fruit , stays on the tree , but fall without shaking them off when they are ripe .
it is very necessary that we forget to pay ourselves what we owe to ourselves .
what we promise ourselves in a fit of passion , when the passion ends , so does the promise .
the violence of either grief or joy destroys their own keeping of them with themselves .
where joy celebrates , grief mourns greatly , propn joys , joy griefs , on a very slender event .
this world does n ’ t say yes , and it ’ s not strange at all that even our loves should change with our fortunes , because it ’ s a question we have to prove , when love leads fortune , or if fortune leads love .
but , to go back to where i started , our wills and fates run in so much in different directions , that our plans are still turned upside down , our thoughts are ours , but their results are n ’ t ours .
so you think you wo n ’ t marry again , but you ’ ll change your mind when your first lord is dead .
if she should break the moment now !
it is a very deep oath .
sleep rock your brain , and may misfortune never mischance between us two !
propn , how like you this play ?
the lady protests too much , i think .
o , but she 'll keep her word .
have you heard the story ?
it ’ s not offensive , is it ?
no , no !
they only pretend , pretend to poison , no offense in the world .
what ’ s the name of the play ?
the propn .
by propn , how ?
a metaphor .
this play is the image of a murder done in propn .
but what o ' that ?
your majesty , and we that have free souls ca n ’ t be touched by it .
let the bitter hussy kick , our saddles do n ’ t pinch .
this is one propn , nephew to the propn .
you are a good chorus , my lord .
i could translate between you and your love , if i could see the toys flirting .
you are forward , my lord , you are forward .
it would cost you a night in bed to take the edge off me .
even better , and worse .
and that ’ s how you must take your husbands .
begin , murderer , argh !
enough with the bad faces , and begin .
he poisons him in the garden for his estate .
his name 's gonzago .
the propn rises .
what , frightened by false fire !
how are you , my lord ?
stop the play .
give me some light .
let ’ s go !
propn , lights , lights !
would n ’ t this do it , sir , together with a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn against with me , with two provincial roses on my shoes i took off , to get me a fellowship for writing with a pack of players , sir ?
half a share .
you might have rhymed those lines .
o good propn , i ’ ll take the ghost 's word for as real as a thousand dollars !
did you see ?
very well , my lord .
when the talk was about the poisoning ?
i watched him very well .
ah , ha !
come , some music !
come , some music !
my good my lord , may i a word with you .
propn , i ’ ll give you a whole history .
the king , sir yes , sir , what about him ?
he ’ s , in his retirement to bed , exceedingly upset .
with drink , sir ?
no , my lord , rather with anger .
you ’ d be wiser and look better if you told all this to the doctor , because for me to try to purge him of anger would probably make him more angry .
my good lord , please re - phrase what you ’ re saying , and do n ’ t give me answers so far away from my question .
i am calm , sir .
ask away .
the queen , your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , has sent me to you .
you are welcome .
no , good my lord , this courtesy is not the right answer .
propn , i can not .
what , my lord ?
but , sir , such answer as i can make , you shall command , or rather , as you say , my mother shall command .
ok , i ’ ll say no more but to the problem .
o wonderful son , that can so astonish a mother !
but is n ’ t there a sequel that follows this mother 's surprise ?
she wants to speak with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
we shall obey , if she were ten times our mother .
have you any else to tell me ?
my lord , you loved me once .
and i still do , by these thieves and robbers .
my good lord , what is your cause of your problem ?
you certainly bar the door to your own freedom if you do n ’ t tell your problems to your friend .
propn , i do n ’ t have a promotion .
how can that be , when the king himself says you will succeed him to the throne in propn ?
yes , sir , but “ while the grass grows ” — the proverb is a bit old - fashioned .
o , the pipes .
let me see one .
to divert your attention , why do you go about trying to figure me out , as if you ’ re to pick a fight ?
o my lord , if my duty is too bold , it ’ s because my love has no manners .
i do n ’ t understand that at all .
will you play on this pipe ?
my lord , i ca n ’ t .
i beg you .
believe me , i ca n ’ t .
i ’ m begging you .
i do n ’ t know how to play it , my lord .
it ’ s as easy as lying .
just close up these holes with your finger and thumb , put it in your mouth and blow , and it will yield the most eloquent music .
look you , these are the holes to cover .
why , look here , at what an unworthy a thing you make of me !
you would play me , you would seem to know my holes to cover , you want to pick out the heart of my mystery , you would sound me from my lowest note to the my highest note , and there is much music , excellent voice , in this little pipe , yet you ca n ’ t play it .
do you think it is easier to play me than a pipe ?
call me whatever instrument you want to , although you can try to cover my holes me , you ca n ’ t play me .
propn bless you , sir !
my lord , the queen wants to speak with you right now .
do you see that cloud over there that 's almost in shape of a camel ?
by the mass , it is indeed like a camel .
i think it is like a weasel .
it is shaped like a weasel .
or like a whale .
very like a whale .
then i will go to my mother by and by .
i will say so .
by - and - by is easily said .
leave me , friends .
now , it ’ s the very witching time of night , when churchyards awake , and hell itself breathes out propn to this world .
now i could drink hot blood , and do such wicked deed that the day would shake nervously to see .
listen !
now to my mother .
o heart , do n ’ t give up now , do n ’ t ever let the soul of propn , the crazy emperor , enter this determined heart .
i do n ’ t like him , and it does n ’ t seem to be safe to us to let his craziness run free .
the terms of our estate may not endure with danger so near to us as his craziness seems to get worse by the hour .
we will get ourselves ready .
it ’ s a most holy and religious fear to keep those many , many bodies safe that depend upon your majesty .
the single and peculiar life is bound , with all the strength and amour of the mind , to keep itself from madness , but much more so for that spirit on whose government the lives of many propn and rest .
the government of a propn propn with him , but draws what 's near it with it , like a gulf .
it is a massive wheel , set at the top of the highest mountain , in which its huge spokes , ten thousand little things are firmly glued together , that , when the wheel falls , each small piece , insignificant event , adds to the noisy ruin of the country .
the propn never sighed by himself , but with the whole country ’ s groan .
get started , i beg you , on this speedy voyage , for we will control this fear , which now goes about too freely .
we will go quickly .
my lord , he 's going to his mother 's bedroom .
i ’ ll hide myself behind the curtain so i can hear what happens , i ’ ll guarantee she 'll set him straight .
and , as you said , and wisely it was said , it is proper that some beside his mother , since nature makes them subjective , should overhear the speech objectively .
goodbye , my lord .
i ’ ll call on you before you go to bed , and tell you what i know .
thanks , my dear lord .
what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with my brother 's blood , is n ’ t there enough rain in the sweet heavens to wash it as white as snow ?
what use is mercy except to confront the face of offense ?
and what 's in prayer except this double force , to be prevented from falling down , or pardoned since we are down ?
then i ’ ll look up , my sin is committed .
but , o , what form of prayer can help me ?
forgive me of my foul murder !
that ca n ’ t be it , since i still have all those things for which i did the murder , my crown , my own ambition , and my queen .
may one be forgiven a sin and still hold on to its benefits ?
what then ?
what stops ?
i ’ ll see what being sorry does .
what ca n ’ t it do ?
o heart as black as death !
o dissolving soul , that , struggling to be free , is more a slave !
help , angels !
make an attempt .
propn , stubborn knees , and , heart , with strings of steel , be soft as the muscles of the newborn baby !
all may be well .
i must think about that .
a villain kills my father , and for that , i , his sole son , do this same villain send to propn .
o , this is a contract and pay , not revenge .
he took my father grossly , full of food , with all his sins on his soul , as full of bloom as propn , and how his report stands , who knows except propn ?
no .
up , sword , and know a more horrid intention .
when he is asleep drunk , or in his rage , or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed , at gaming , swearing , or committing some act that has no element of salvation in it , then attack him , so that his heels may kick at propn , and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell , where it goes to .
my mother is waiting .
this relief only makes your sickly days longer .
my words go up , my thoughts stay here below .
words without thoughts never go to propn .
he will come right away .
see that you are direct with him .
tell him his pranks have been too excessive to put up with , and that your grace has taken a lot of heat because of him .
i ’ ll hide here silently .
i beg you , be firm with him .
hide , i hear him coming .
now , mother , what 's the matter ?
propn , you have offended your father very much .
mother , you have offended my father very much .
come , come , you answer me stupidly .
go , go , you answer me with wickedness .
why , how can you , propn !
what 's the matter now ?
have you forgotten i ’ m your mother ?
no , by the church , i have n ’ t .
you are the propn , your husband 's brother 's wife , and , i wish it was n ’ t so , but you are my mother .
no , then , i ’ ll send those to you who can speak .
what will you do ?
you wilt not murder me ?
help , help , ho !
what , ho !
help , help , help !
draws .
o , i am slain !
o me , what have you done ?
no , i do n ’ t know .
is it the king ?
o , what a thoughtless and bloody deed this is !
a bloody deed !
almost as bad , good mother , as killing a king and marrying his brother .
as killing a king !
yes , lady , that ’ s what i said .
you wretched , rash , intruding fool , goodbye !
i mistook you for the propn .
leave wringing of your hands .
quiet !
what have i done , that you dare scream at me so loudly and rudely ?
propn 's face glows— yes , this solid and compound body with a trustful face— as against the end of the world , is sickened by the thought of the act .
ah me , what act propn so loudly and thunders in the wind ?
look here upon this picture and on this one , the representation of two brothers .
here is your husband , like a mildewed ear of corn poisoning his wholesome brother .
have you got eyes ?
could you feed on this fair mountain , and glut yourself on this swamp ?
huh ?
have you got eyes ?
what devil was it that trick you like this with a blindfold ?
eyes without feeling , feeling without sight , ears without hands or eyes , smelling without them all , or a sickly part of one true sense could n ’ t act like this without a conscious thought .
o shame !
are n ’ t you embarrassed ?
rebellious hell , if you can rebel in an old lady ’ s bones , then let virtue be like wax to burning youth , and melt in her own fire .
proclaim no shame when the compulsive passion takes charge , since frost itself burns as well , and reason pimps the will .
o propn , do n ’ t say anything else .
you turn my eyes into my very soul , and there i see such black and grainy spots as will not leave their color .
no , but to live in the rotten sweat of an greasy bed , stewed in corruption , using sweet words and making love over the nasty pig sty .
no more .
a king of shreds and patches !
save me and hover over me with your wings , you heavenly guards !
what does you gracious figure want ?
alas , he 's crazy !
do n ’ t you come to scold your tardy son , that , forgetting time and passion , lets the important acting of your dread command go by ?
o , tell me !
do n ’ t forget .
this visitation is only to sharpen your almost dull purpose .
but , look , amazement sits on your mother ’ s face .
speak to her , propn .
how are you , lady ?
alas , how are you , that you look on empty space , and carry on a conversation with the invisible air ?
your spirits wildly peep from your eyes , and , as the sleeping soldiers at the alarm , your bedded hairs , like life in growths , start up and stand an end .
o gentle son , propn cool patience on the heat and flame of your anger !
where do you look ?
on him , on him !
look how pale he glares !
then what i have to do will need true colours , tears perhaps for blood .
to whom do you speak this ?
do you see nothing there ?
nothing at all , yet all that i see is .
you hear nothing ?
no , nothing but ourselves .
why , look there !
look how it steals away !
my father in his clothes as he lived !
look , where he goes , even now out the door !
this is the very product of your brain .
this bodiless creation is very cunning in imagination .
imagination !
my pulse does temperately keep time like yours , and is just as healthful as yours .
it ’ s not craziness that i have spoken .
test me , and i will re - word the problem , which madness would run away from .
mother , for love of grace , do n ’ t put that flattering oil on your soul that says my craziness speaks and not your sin .
it will only create a scab and film over the ulcer , while rotten corruption , working within everything , infects it unseen .
confess yourself to propn , propn what 's past , avoid what is to come , and do n ’ t spread fertilizer on the weeds , to make them more rotten .
forgive me my truth , because , in the fatness of these wealthy times propn itself must beg pardon of vice , yes , beg and court for permission to do him good .
o propn , you cut my heart in two .
o , throw away the worse part of it , and live the purer life with the other half .
but do n ’ t go to my uncle 's bed , propn as though you have a virtue if you do n ’ t have it .
that monster habit , who eats all sense , of all evil habits is an angel in this , that in order to use fair and good actions , he likewise gives a dress or uniform that is ready to wear .
the next more easy , for use can almost change what is natural , and can either curb the devil or throw him out with wondrous effectiveness .
i am sorry , but propn has decided it to be this way , to punish me with this act , and punish this act with me , that i must be their whip and whip - er .
i will hide him , and will answer the death i gave him well .
so again , goodnight .
one word more , good lady .
what shall i do ?
do n ’ t think it ’ s good to tell him , for who except a queen , fair , sober , wise , would hide from a frog , from a bat , a cat , such dear concerns ?
who would do so ?
no , in spite of sense and secrecy , do n ’ t open the basket on the roof , let the birds fly , and , like the famous ape to test conclusions , do n ’ t creep into the basket and break your own neck .
be assured , if words are made of breath , and breath is made of life , i have no life to breathe what you have said to me .
i must go to propn , you know that ?
propn , i had forgotten .
let it be , because it ’ s the sport to have the swordsman killed with his own sword , and it wo n ’ t be easy but i will dig one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon .
o , it is most sweet , when you can kill two birds with one stone .
mother , goodnight .
indeed , this counselor is now most still , most secret , and most grave , who was a foolish gabby rogue in life .
come , sir , to finish up with you .
good night , mother .
there 's a problem in these sighs .
where is your son ?
leave us alone for a little while .
ah , my good lord , what have i seen tonight !
what , propn ?
how is propn ?
as crazy as the sea and wind , when both fight over which is mightier .
in his wild fit , hearing something stir behind the curtain , he whips out his knife , cries ' a rat , a rat !
and in this headstrong state , kills the hidden good old man .
o heavy deed !
it would ’ ve been us if we had been there .
his freedom is full of threats to everyone , to you yourself , to us , to every one .
alas , how shall this bloody deed be explained ?
it will be our fault , who should ’ ve kept this mad young man on a short leash , restrained , and out of society .
but we loved him so much that we would not understand what was the best action , but , like the owner of a dirty disease , to keep it from showing , let it feed even on the core of life .
where has he gone ?
he weeps for what is done .
o propn , let ’ s go !
propn , guildenstern !
friends both , go get some further assistance .
propn has propn slain in insanity , and he has dragged him from his mother 's bedroom .
go find him , speak gently , and bring the body into the chapel .
i beg you , hurry .
come , propn , we 'll call up our wisest friends , and let them know both what we mean to do and what 's done at an unfortunate time .
so maybe slander , whose whisper covers the entire world as surely as the cannon hits its target and delivers his poisoned shot , may miss our name , and not amount to anything at all .
my soul is full of confusion and sorrow .
safely hidden .
propn !
propn propn !
what ’ s that noise ?
who calls propn ?
here they come .
what have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
mixed it with dust , to which it is related .
tell us where it is , that we may take it from there , and carry it to the chapel .
do n ’ t believe it .
believe what ?
that i can keep your advice , and not my own .
you take me for a sponge , my lord ?
yes , sir , that soaks up the propn 's face , his rewards , his authorities .
but such officers do the king best service in the end .
he keeps them , like an ape , in the corner of his jaw , first to be tasted , and then at last swallowed .
when he needs what you have found out , it is by squeezing you , and , sponge , you shall be dry again .
i do n ’ t understand you , my lord .
i am glad of it .
a clever speech is wasted on a stupid ear .
my lord , you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king .
the body is with the king , but the king is not with the body .
the king is a thing , a thing , my lord !
of nothing .
bring me to him .
hide , fox , and show all later .
i have sent to find him and the body .
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose !
yet we must not put the strong law on him .
he 's very popular with this country ’ s masses , who like not in their minds , but with their eyes , and where it is so , the offender 's punishment is important , but never the offense .
to deal with everything smoothly and evenly , this sudden sending him away must seem like a planned event .
diseases grown desperate are best healed by desperate measures , or not at all .
we can not get from him where the dead body is hidden , my lord .
but where is he ?
outside , my lord , guarded , to know what you want .
bring him before us .
propn , guildenstern !
bring in my lord .
now , propn , where 's propn ?
at supper .
at supper !
where ?
not where he eats , but where he is eaten .
a certain group of educated worms are now biting him .
your worm is your only emperor for diet .
we fatten up all other creatures to fatten us up , when we fatten ourselves for maggots .
your fat king and your lean beggar interchangeable , two dishes but for one table .
that 's the end .
alas , alas !
a man may fish with the worm that has eaten a king , and eat the fish that has fed on that worm .
what do you mean by this ?
nothing but to show you how a king may progress through the guts of a beggar .
where is propn ?
in propn .
send there to see .
if your messenger ca n ’ t find him there , look for him in the other place yourself .
but , indeed , if you do n ’ t find him within this month , you will smell him as you go up the stairs into the lobby .
go find him there .
he will stay until you come .
propn , for this deed , for your special safety , which we do consider as we dearly grieve for what you ’ ve done , we must send you away with fiery quickness .
for propn !
yes , propn .
good .
so it is , if you knew our reasons .
i see an angel that sees them .
but , come , for propn !
goodbye , dear mother .
your loving father , propn .
my mother .
propn and mother is man and wife , man and wife is one flesh , and so , my mother .
come , for propn !
i ’ ll have him away tonight .
away !
because everything is sealed and done that relies on this affair .
i beg you , hurry .
and , propn , if you hold my love at anything , as my great power may give you some sense , since your scar still looks raw and red after the danish sword , and your open fear propn homage to us , you might not view our sovereign process coldly , which gives you full power , by letters testifying to that effect , the present death of propn .
do it , propn , because , he rages like the pace of my blood , and you must cure me .
until i know it is done , however great my luck , my joys can never begin .
go , captain , send my greetings to the danish king .
tell him that , with his permission , propn propn to carry out a promised march over his kingdom .
you know the meeting place .
if his majesty has anything for us to do , we shall express our duty in person , and let him know so .
i will do it , my lord .
go softly on .
good sir , whose armies are these ?
they are from propn , sir .
for what purpose , sir , i beg you ?
against some part of propn .
who commands them , sir ?
the nephew to old propn , propn .
does it go against the main part of propn , sir , or for some frontier ?
to speak honestly , and with no addition to the facts , we go to gain a little patch of ground that ’ s not worth anything except its name .
to pay five dollars , five , i would n ’ t farm it , and it wo n ’ t yield either to propn or the propn a worse rate if it should it be sold in payment .
why , then the propn never will defend it .
yes , it already has garrisons .
two thousand souls and twenty thousand dollars will not settle the question of who owns this worthless land .
this is the abscess of much wealth and peace , that breaks inward , and shows no damage until the man dies .
i humbly thank you , sir .
propn be with you , sir .
will you please go , my lord ?
i ’ ll be with you right away .
walk a little before me .
how every event works against me to spur my dull revenge !
what is a man , if his chief good and use of his time is only to sleep and eat ?
a beast , no more .
surely he that made us with such large capacity , looking before and after , did n ’ t give us that capability and godlike reason to go stale in us , unused .
now , where it is beastly forgetfulness , or some defeated principle of thinking too much on the event , a thought which , cut in quarters , has but one part wisdom and always three parts coward , i do n ’ t know why i am still live to say “ this thing 's to do , “ since i have cause , and will , and strength , and means to do it .
examples , as obvious as dirt , urge me .
look at this army , of such size and power , led by a delicate and tender prince , whose spirit , with divine ambition puffed up , makes faces at the invisible event , exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that luck , death , and danger dare to do , even for an eggshell .
rightly to be great is not to move without great argument , but to find quarrel greatly in worthless land when honor ’ s at stake .
how do i stand , then , that have a father killed , a mother stained , propn of my reason and my blood , and let all sleep while , to my shame , i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that , for a whim and trick of fame , go to their graves like going to bed , fight for a plot on which the numbers do n ’ t have room to fight for the propn , which is not tomb enough and big enough to hide the slain ?
o , from this time forth , my thoughts be bloody , or be worth nothing !
i will not speak with her .
she is unfortunate , indeed deranged .
her mood must be pitied .
what does she need ?
she speaks a lot about her father , she says she hears there are tricks in the world , and coughs , and beats her chest , propn enviously at nothing , says things in doubt that only make half sense .
her speech is nothing , yet the random use of it moves the listeners to collect them , they aim at making sense of it , and mix her words up fit to their own ideas , which , as her winks and nods and gestures as she speaks , would indeed make someone think there might be clear , though nothing for sure , yet very unhappily .
it would be good she were spoken with , because she may scatter dangerous ideas in rude minds .
let her come in .
to my sick soul , such as sin 's true nature is , each new thing seems to be the prelude to some great harm .
guilt is so full of artless jealousy , that it spills itself in fearing to be spilled .
where is the beauteous majesty of propn ?
how should i know your true love from another one ?
by his whimsical bat and his staff and his sandal shoes .
alas , sweet lady , what does this song mean ?
what did you say ?
no , i beg you , listen .
he is dead and gone , lady , he is dead and gone , at his head a grass green turf , at his heels a stone .
no , but propn i beg you , listen .
his shroud is as white as the mountain snow , propn , look here , my lord !
all covered with sweet flowers , which drowned in tears went to the grave with showers of true love .
how do you , pretty lady ?
well , propn protect you !
they say the owl was a baker 's daughter .
propn , we know what we are , but do n ’ t know what we may be .
propn be at your table !
thinking on her father .
then up he rose and put on his clothes , and opened the chamber door , let in the maid that rejected a maid and never left again .
propn propn !
indeed , la , without an oath , i ’ ll make an end on it .
by propn and by propn propn , propn , and for shame , for shame !
young men will do it if they come to it , by propn , they are to blame .
how long has she been like this ?
i hope all will be well .
we must be patient .
but i can not choose but weep , to think they would lay him in the cold ground .
my brother shall know of it .
and so i thank you for your good counsel .
come , my coach !
follow her closely , watch her well , i beg you .
o , this is the poison of deep grief , it all springs from her father 's death .
o my dear propn , this worry , compared to a murdering piece , gives me more than enough death in many places .
for pity ’ s sake , what ’ s this noise ?
where are my swiss guards ?
let them guard the door .
what is the matter ?
save yourself , my lord .
the ocean , exceeding of his borders , does n ’ t eat the flatlands with more impatient speed than young propn , heading a riot , takes over your offices .
the crowd calls him lord , and , as the world were just beginning now , old history forgotten , customs not known , they certify and prop up every word , they cry “ we choose !
o , this is rebellion , you false danish dogs !
the doors are broken .
where is this king ?
sirs , you all wait outside .
no , let 's come in .
i beg you , leave me alone .
we will , we will .
i thank you .
guard the door .
o you vile king , give me my father !
calmly , good propn .
that drop of blood that 's in control says i ’ m a bastard , propn my father ’ s wife was unfaithful , brands the harlot even here , between the chaste unmarked brows of my true mother .
what is the cause , propn , that your rebellion looks so huge ?
there 's such divinity that surrounds a king , that treason can only peep to what it would do , acts little by his will .
tell me , propn , why are you so angry like this ?
let him go , propn .
speak , man .
where is my father ?
dead .
but he did n ’ t do it .
why is he dead ?
propn , to the blackest devil !
conscience and grace , to the deepest pit !
i dare damnation .
who shall prevent you from it ?
my will alone , nothing else in the world .
and i ’ ll use my methods so well , that they shall go far with little effort .
propn propn , if you desire to know the circumstances of your dear father 's death , is it written in your revenge that , in the gambling , you will draw both friend and foe , winner and loser ?
no one but his enemies .
will you know them then ?
i ’ ll open my arms wide like this to his good friends , and , like the pelican of the old fables , feed them with my own blood .
why , now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman .
it shall penetrate your understanding that i am innocent of your father 's death , and am most sincerely in grief for it , as day penetrates your eye .
let her come in .
how now !
what ’ s that noise ?
o heat , dry up my brains !
tears with seven times the propn , burn out the sight and truth of my eyes !
dear maid , kind sister , sweet propn !
o heavens !
is it possible a young maid 's sanity should be die as does an old man ?
nature is short in love , and where it is short , it sends some precious moment of itself close to the thing it loves .
they bore him barefaced on the bier hey no nonny , nonny , hey nonny and on his grave rained many a tear .
fare you well , my dove !
had you your sanity , and you persuaded me to revenge , it could n ’ t move like this .
it is the false servant , that stole his master 's daughter .
this “ nothing ” is more than just a story .
there 's fennel for you , and columbines .
there 's rue for you , and here 's some for me .
there 's a daisy .
i would give you some violets , but they withered all when my father died .
and will he not come again ?
and will he not come again ?
no , no , he is dead , go to your death - bed , he never will come again .
his beard was as white as snow , all white was his hair .
he is gone , he is gone , and we go away crying .
propn have mercy on his soul !
and of all christian souls , i pray propn .
propn be with you .
do you see this , o propn ?
laertes , i must share your grief , or you deny me my rights .
step aside , choose whichever of your wisest friends you want , and they shall hear and judge between you and me .
if they find that we killed your father or had him killed , we will surrender our kingdom , our crown , our life , and all that we call ours , to you in satisfaction , but if not , you must be patient with us , and we shall work together with your soul to give it just compensation .
i agree , his means of death , his obscure burial , no trophy , sword , no coat of arms over his bones no noble rites or state funeral , cry to be heard , from propn to earth as it were , that i must call it into question .
and so you shall , and wherever the guilt is , that ’ s where the punishment will be .
i beg you , go with me .
who wants to speak with me ?
sailors , sir .
they say they have letters for you .
let them in .
i do n ’ t know from what part of the world i should be contacted , if not by propn propn .
propn bless you , sir .
let him bless you too .
he shall , sir , if it pleases him .
propn , when you read this , give these fellows some way to talk to the king .
they have letters for him .
before we were even at sea for two days , a very nasty looking pirate chased us .
finding ourselves sailing too slow , we put up a great fight , and , in the skirmish , i boarded them .
just then , they sailed away from our ship , so only i became their prisoner .
let the king have the letters i have sent , and come to see me with as much haste as you would fly death .
i have words to speak into your ear will make you speechless , but are they much too light for the heart of the matter .
these good fellows will bring you to where i am .
propn and propn are still going to propn .
i have much to tell you about them .
goodbye .
he that you knows you , propn .
then you can direct me to him you delivered them for .
now you must see that i am not guilty , and you must put me in your heart as a friend , since you have heard , and with a knowing ear , that man who killed your noble father wanted to kill me .
it seems to be the truth .
but tell me why did n ’ t you take action against these things , so full of crime and punishable by death , as you mainly were upset by concern for your safety , wisdom , if nothing else .
o , for two special reasons , which may to you , perhaps , seem a bit cowardly , but yet to me they are strong .
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks , and for myself , whether it ’ s my virtue or my plague , she 's so necessary to my life and soul , that , as the star moves only in his orbit , i could n ’ t do anything without her say - so .
the other motive , why i could n ’ t go to a public court , is the great love the people of this country have for him , who , dipping all his faults in their affection , would , like the spring that turn wood to stone , convert his crimes to graces , so that my actions , not at all popular with the masses , would have reflected badly on me , and not be taken as i intended them .
and so i have lost a noble father , a sister driven into insanity , whose worth , if praises may go back again , stood as a challenger to the most beautiful woman of all time for her perfections .
but my revenge will come .
do n ’ t lose any sleep over it .
you must n ’ t think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our power be shaken with danger , and think it unimportant .
you will soon hear more .
what news ?
letters , my lord , from propn .
this one to your majesty , this one to the queen .
from propn !
who brought them ?
sailors , my lord , they say , i did n ’ t see them .
laertes , you shall hear them .
leave us alone .
high and mighty , you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom .
what does this mean ?
are all the rest returning ?
or is it some trick and no such thing ?
do you recognize the writing ?
it ’ s propn 's handwriting .
i have no idea , my lord .
but let him come .
how can it be otherwise ?
yes , my lord , just as long as you do n ’ t ask me to forget about it .
only to your own satisfaction .
it ’ s falling into place .
you have been talked about since your travel so much , for a quality where , they say , you really shine .
all your parts together did n ’ t arouse such jealousy in him as did that one , and that , in my regard , is his weak spot .
what part is that , my lord ?
a very ribbon in the cap of youth , but necessary too , for youth does n ’ t look less well in the fun and reckless clothes that it wears than old age settles for his black furs and woolens , showing health and seriousness .
two months ago , there was a gentleman from propn here , i ’ ve seen myself , and served against the propn , and they can do well on horseback , but this gallant had witchcraft in it .
he grew into his seat , and had his horse do such wonderful things , as if he had been absorbed into the horse ’ s body with the brave beast .
he so impressed me , that i , through lies and tricks , did n ’ t waste time in finding out what he did .
a propn , was it ?
a propn .
i swear , propn .
the very same .
i know him well .
he is the jewel , indeed , and gem of the whole nation .
propn , this report of his propn propn with envy that he could n ’ t do anything but wish and beg your sudden coming over her to play with him .
laertes , was your father dear to you ?
not that i think you did n ’ t love your father , but because i know love is begun by time , and i see , in the ways of love , that time dampens the spark and fire of it .
within the very flame of love , there lives a kind of wick or snuff that will put it out , and nothing is worse than goodness staying still , for goodness , growing to an infectious flu , propn in his own too much .
what we want to do , we should do when we would , for this ' would ' changes , and has stoppages and delays as many as there are voices , hands , accidents , and then this ' should ' is like the sigh of a spendthrift , that hurts by easing up .
but to the heart of the matter .
propn comes back .
what would you do to show yourself your father 's son in deed more than in words ?
to cut his throat in the church .
murder , indeed , should not be a church activity , because then revenge should have no bounds .
when propn returns , he shall know you ’ re home .
we 'll start rumors that praise your excellence and exaggerate the fame the propn gave you , bring you together in the end , and place bets on your fight .
he , being weak , most generous , and free from all trickery , will not think about swords , so that easily , or with a little mix up , you may choose a sword that ’ s not poisoned , and , in a pass during practice , kill him in revenge for your father .
i ’ ll do it .
and for that purpose , i ’ ll poison my sword .
i bought an oil of a mountebank , so mortal that , only dip a knife in it , where it draws blood , no super - potion so rare , collected from all antidotes under the moon that have always worked , can save the thing from death and this is only with a scratch .
i ’ ll touch the point of my sword with this poison so that , if i touch him slightly , it will kill him .
therefore this project should have a plan b or c , that might hold if this first one failed .
hang on !
let me think .
we 'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings , i have it !
while you ’ re moving around and you are hot and dry , since you ’ ll make your bouts more violent to that purpose , and he calls for drink , i ’ ll have prepared a propn for him for that purpose , so that even only sipping , if he escapes your stick of venom by luck , we can be successful this way .
what now , sweet queen !
one sorrow walks on the heels of another , following too fast .
your sister 's drowned , propn .
drowned !
o , where ?
alas , then she is drowned ?
drowned , drowned .
you had too much water , poor propn , and therefore i ’ ll hold back my tears , but it is still our trick , nature holds her habits , let shame say what it will .
when these tears are gone , propn will be extinct .
propn , my lord .
i have a rumor of fire , that i would gladly spread , before this news puts the fire out .
let 's follow him , propn , .
i had all i could do to calm his anger !
now i fear this will make it start all over again , therefore let 's follow him .
is she to be buried in christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation ?
i tell you she is , and therefore make her grave straight .
the coroner has decided , and finds it christian burial .
how can that be , unless she drowned herself in her own defense ?
why , that ’ s the coroner ’ s finding .
it must be self - offense .
it ca n ’ t be anything else .
here lies the water , good .
here stands the man , good .
but is this law ?
yes , by propn , it ’ s the coroner ’ s inquest law .
will you know the truth about it ?
if this had n ’ t been a gentlewoman , she should have been buried without a christian burial .
why , there you ’ ve said it .
and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than another propn .
come , my spade .
there are no old gentlemen but gardeners , ditchers , and grave - makers .
they hold up propn 's profession .
was he a gentleman ?
he was the first that ever bore arms .
why , he had none .
what , are you a pagan ?
how do you understand the scripture ?
the scripture says propn digged .
could he dig without arms ?
i ’ ll put another question to you .
the gallows - maker , for that frame outlives a thousand tenants .
i like your joke , i swear .
do it again , come on .
who builds stronger than a mason , a shipbuilder , or a carpenter ?
yes , tell me that , and stop my guessing .
by propn , now i can tell .
do it .
mass , i can not tell .
go , get you to propn , bring me a mug of whiskey .
in youth when i did love , did love , i thought it was very sweet , to contract , o , the time for , ah , my reason , o , i thought there was nothing meet .
has this fellow no feeling of his business , that he sings at grave - digging ?
propn has made it a property of easiness in him .
that ’ s true .
the one that does n ’ t work has the more delicate sense .
but age , with his stealing steps , has clawed me in his clutch , and has shipped me until the land , as if i had never been such .
that skull had a tongue in it , and could sing once .
how the man jowls it to the ground , as if it were propn 's jawbone , that did the first murder !
this might be the head of a politician , which this ass now reaches over one that would go around propn , might it not ?
it might , my lord .
or of a courtier , which could say ' good morrow , sweet lord !
how are you , good lord ?
this might be my lord so - and - so , that praised my lord such - and - such 's horse when he meant to ask for it , might it not ?
yes , my lord .
why , even so .
and now my propn propn 's , no jaw and knocked about the face with a sexton 's spade .
here 's fine turnaround , if we were able to see it .
did these bones cost no more the making of them but to play at games with them ?
mine ache to think about it .
a pickaxe and a spade , a spade , for and a shrouding sheet , propn a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is ptoper .
there 's another .
why ca n ’ t that be the skull of a lawyer ?
where are his arguments now , his pens , his cases , his subpoenas , and his tricks ?
why does he allow this rude fellow to knock him about the head now , with a dirty shovel , and will not tell him why he ’ s being hit ?
hum !
this fellow might have been a great buyer of land in his time , with his statutes , his emblems , his fine art , his double billing , his house seizures ?
is this the finest of his fine art , and the seizure of his house seizures , to have his fine pate full of fine dirt ?
will his billing bill him no more for his purchases , and double ones too , than the length and breadth of a pair of property liens ?
the very transfers of his lands will scarcely lie in this box , and must the inheritor himself have no more , huh ?
not a jot more , my lord .
is n ’ t parchment made of sheep - skins ?
yes , my lord , and of calf - skins too .
they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that .
i will speak to this fellow .
whose grave is this , sir ?
mine , sir .
o , a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet .
i think it ’ s yours indeed , for you lie in it .
you lie out of it , sir , and therefore it ’ s not yours .
for my part , i do n ’ t lie in it , yet it ‘ s mine .
you do lie in it , to be in it and say it is yours .
it is for the dead , not for the quick , therefore you lie .
it is a quick lie , sir , it will go away again from me to you .
what man dot you dig it for ?
for no man , sir .
what woman then ?
for none neither .
who is to be buried in it ?
one that was a woman , sir , but , rest her soul , she 's dead .
how absolutely clever this chap is !
we must speak by the book or lying will undo us .
by the propn , propn , these three years i have noted that the age is grown so picky that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier , he hurts his feelings .
how long have you been a grave - maker ?
of all the days in the year , i became a grave - maker the day that our last propn propn overcame propn .
how long is that since ?
ca n ’ t you tell that ?
every fool can tell that .
it was the very day that young propn was born , he that is crazy and sent into propn .
yes , by propn , why was he sent to propn ?
he shall get his mind back there , or , if he does n ’ t , it 's no great problem there .
why ?
it will not be seen in him there .
there the men are as crazy as he is .
how did he become crazy ?
very strangely , they say .
how strangely ?
actually , even by losing his mind .
on what grounds ?
why , here in propn .
i have been sexton here , man and boy , thirty years .
how long will a man lie in the earth before he rots ?
well , if he ’ s not rotten before he dies , as we have many small pox corpses nowadays that will scarce last beyond the wake , he will last you some eight years or nine years .
a tanner will last you nine years .
why he more than another ?
why , sir , his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while , and your water is a sore decayer of your wretched dead body .
here 's a skull now .
this skull has been buried three - and - twenty years .
whose was it ?
a bastard , crazy fellow 's it was .
whose do you think it was ?
no , i know not .
a pestilence on him for a crazy rogue !
he poured a pint of propn wine on my head once .
this same skull , sir , was propn 's skull , the king 's jester .
this one ?
just that one .
alas , poor propn !
i knew him , propn , a fellow of infinite fun , of most excellent imagination .
i want to vomit .
here hung those lips that i have kissed i do n ’ t know how many times .
where are your jokes now ?
your games ?
your songs ?
your flashes of laughter that always make the audience roar ?
no one now , to mock your own grinning ?
quite jaw - fallen ?
i beg you , propn , tell me one thing .
what 's that , my lord ?
do you think propn the propn looked like this in the earth ?
yuck !
just like that , my lord .
what common uses we may return to , propn !
why ca n ’ t imagination trace the noble dust of propn until he finds it stopping a wine barrel ?
it ’ s thinking about it too much to think like that .
propn propn , dead and turned to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
o , that the earth which kept the world in fear should patch a wall to expel the winter 's cold !
but quiet !
who is that they ’ re following ?
and with such shortened rites ?
this shows that the corpse they follow did , with a desperate hand , propn suicide .
it was of some nobility .
let ’ s hide and listen .
what other ceremony ?
that is propn , a very noble youth .
look .
what other ceremony ?
her funeral rites have been as far enlarged as we can enlarge .
is n ’ t there more be done ?
lay her in the earth , and may violets spring from her fair and unpolluted flesh !
i tell you , churlish priest , my sister shall be a ministering angel when you lie howling .
what , the fair propn ?
sweets to the sweet .
farewell .
i hoped you would have been my propn 's wife , i thought to have decorated your bride - bed , sweet maid , and not your grave .
o , three times sorrow fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed deprived you of your most wonderful intelligence !
stop the burial a while , until i hold her once more in mine arms .
now bury the living and dead , until you have made a mountain from this flat earth to be higher than the mountain of propn or the skyish head of blue propn propn .
this is i , propn the propn .
the devil take your soul !
you do n ’ t pray well .
i beg you , take your fingers from my throat , for , although i am not impatient and rash , i still have something dangerous in me , which you should fear .
take away your hand !
separate them .
gentlemen !
my good lord , be quiet .
why , i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer blink .
o my son , what theme ?
i loved propn !
forty thousand brothers could n ’ t , even with all their quantity of love , make up my sum .
what will you do for her ?
o , he is crazy , propn .
for love of propn , leave him alone !
propn ’ s wounds , show me what you 'll do .
i ’ ll do it .
be buried quickly with her , and so will i .
and , if you babble about mountains , let them throw millions of acres on us , until our ground , singeing his head against the burning sun , make the highest mountain like a wart !
no , if you ’ ll speak , i ’ ll rant as well as you .
eventually , as patient as the female dove when that her golden twins are discovered , his silence will sit drooping .
i always loved you .
but it ’ s not important .
let propn himself do what he may , the cat will mew and every dog will have his day .
propn propn , put a guard over your son .
this grave shall have a living monument .
so much for this , sir .
now as for the other thing , you do remember all the circumstances ?
remember it , my lord !
propn , there was a kind of fighting in my heart that would n ’ t let me sleep .
i thought i lay worse than in a rebellion , in the chains .
such ghosts and goblins in my life , that , on my arrival , without any delay , no , not even to wait for the grinding of the axe , my head should be chopped off .
is it possible ?
but will you listen to how i proceeded ?
go ahead ..
being surrounded like this with evil plans , before i could start thinking about it , before they could execute the plan , i sat myself down , though up a new order , wrote it just like the original .
i used to think , as our politicians do , a sin to make a forgery and worked hard at how to forget that learning , but , sir , now it did me a useful service .
do you want to know the effect of what i wrote ?
yes , good my lord .
an earnest oath from the king , as propn was his faithful ally , as love between them might flourish like the palm tree , as peace should still wear her wheaten garland and stand like a comma between their friendships , and many “ as - es ” like that of great emotion , that , on the view and knowledge of these contents , without further discussion , more or less , he should the bearers put to sudden death , not even allowing time for confession and penance .
how was this sealed ?
why , even in that was propn good to me .
now , the next day was our sea - fight , and what followed you know already .
so propn and propn go to it .
why , man , they did make love to this job .
their defeat grew by their own actions .
it is dangerous when the lower nature comes between the ups and downs of mighty opposites .
why , what a king is this !
does n ’ t it , do you thank , become my responsibility to kill he that has killed my king , and whored my mother , push himself in between the election and my hope to be propn , tried to kill me , and with such knowledge , is n ’ t it perfect duty to kill him with this arm ?
and is n ’ t it to be damned to let this canker of our nature do further evil ?
the time between is mine , and a man 's life is longer than it takes to say “ one .
but i am very sorry , good propn , that i forgot myself to propn , because , by the image of my cause , i can see myself in him .
i ’ ll court his favors .
but , for sure , the bravery of his grief put me into a towering passion .
propn , who ’ s coming here ?
your lordship is right welcome back to propn .
i humbly thank you , sir .
do you know this water - fly ?
no , my good lord .
your state is the more gracious , for it is a vice to know him .
he has much fertile land .
let a beast be lord of beasts , and his cattle shall stand at the king 's dinner table .
he ’ s a clown , but , as i say , proud to own dirt .
sweet lord , if your lordship were not busy , i should impart a thing to you from his majesty .
i will listen very carefully .
put your hat to its right use .
it is for the head .
i thank your lordship , it is very hot .
no , believe me , it is very cold , the wind is northerly .
it is unusually cold , my lord , indeed .
i think it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
exceedingly , my lord , it is very sultry , i ca n ’ t tell how .
but , my lord , his majesty asked me to tell you that he has placed a great wager on your head .
propn , here propn is newly come to court , believe me , an absolute gentleman , full of most excellent traits , of very soft manners and looking great .
indeed , to speak feelingly of him , he is the card or calendar of gentry , because you shall find in him the continent of what a gentleman is .
propn , his refinement suffers no lie from you , although , i know , to divide him like an inventor would make the memory dizzy with arithmetic , and yet not off course , in regard to his quick sail .
but , in the truth of praise , i take him to be a soul of great note , and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as , to make true talk of him , he is what you see , and whoever copies him , is his shadow , nothing more .
your lordship speaks most truly of him .
the concern sir ?
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rare breath ?
propn ?
is n ’ t it possible to understand in another tongue ?
you will do it , propn , really .
what about the naming of this gentleman ?
of propn ?
of him , sir .
well , sir .
i mean , sir , for his weapon , but in the imputation laid on him by them , in his skill , he has no equal .
what 's his weapon ?
propn and dagger .
that 's two of his weapons .
but never mind .
what do you call the carriages ?
i knew you must be aware of the margin before you had finished .
the carriages , sir , are the hangers .
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannons by our sides .
i would it might be hangers till then .
but , on .
why is this all wagered , as you call it ?
what if i say no ?
i mean , my lord , the fight of your person in trial .
propn , i will walk here in the hall .
if it please his majesty , it is the relaxing time of day with me .
shall i re - deliver your answer like that ?
with my meaning , sir , however you want to say it .
i commend my duty to your lordship .
yours , yours .
he does well to praise himself , because no one else will praise him .
a just hatched bird runs away with eggshell on his head .
he did comply with his mother ’ s breast before he sucked it .
he has , and many more just like him that i know the worthless age dotes on , are only part of a craze and have the outward appearance of style , a kind of swollen collection , which carries them through and through the most airless opinions and only blows them to their real experience when the bubbles are burst .
my lord , his majesty sent a message to you by propn propn , who tells him that you will meet him in the hall .
he want to know if will play with propn now , or whether you will take a longer time .
i am true to my intentions ; they follow the king 's pleasure .
if he is ready now , i am too , now or whenever , provided that i am so able as i am now .
the propn and propn and all are coming down .
in happy time .
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to propn before you start to play .
she instructs me well .
you will lose this wager , my lord .
i do n ’ t think so .
since he went to propn , i have been in constant practice .
i shall win at the odds .
but you would n ’ t know what a bad feeling i have inside .
but it does n ’ t matter .
no , my good lord , it ’ s only foolishness , but it is such a kind of misgiving as would maybe trouble a woman .
if you have a gut feeling , obey it .
being ready is everything .
since no man has anything of what he leaves , what is it to leave soon ?
come , propn , come , and take this hand from me .
give me your pardon , sir .
this propn knows , and you must have heard , how i am punished with a painful madness .
what i have done that might deeply hurt your nature , honor , and complaints , i here proclaim was craziness .
was it propn who wronged laertes ?
never propn .
who does it , then ?
his madness .
propn , before this audience , let my denial of evil intent give me immunity in your most generous thoughts as though i have shot my arrow over the house and hurt my brother .
i am satisfied in nature , whose motive , in this case , should move me the most to my revenge .
but in my terms of honor i hold back , and will make no reconciliation until , by some elder masters of known honor , i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name unbloody .
but until that time , i receive your offered love like love , and wo n ’ t do it wrong .
i accept it freely , and will play this brother 's wager honestly .
give us the swords , come on .
come , one for me .
i ’ ll be your mirror , propn .
in my ignorance , your skill shall , like a star in the darkest night , be shown to its fiery advantage indeed .
you mock me , sir .
no , honestly .
give them the swords , propn propn .
propn propn , you know the wager ?
i have seen you both , but since he 's gotten better , we have , therefore , odds .
i like this one .
all these swords have a length ?
yes , my good lord .
set up the goblets of wine for me on that table .
if propn gives the first or second hit , or quits in answer of the third exchange , let all the battlements fire their ammunition , the king shall drink to propn 's better breath , and in the cup he shall throw a pearl , richer than that which four successive kings have worn in propn 's crown .
give me the cups , and let the kettle drum speak to the trumpet , the trumpet to the cannon man outside , the cannons to the heavens , the heavens to earth , ' now the king drinks to propn . ” come , begin .
and you , the judges , watch carefully .
come on , sir .
come , my lord .
one .
no .
judges ?
a hit , a hit that was felt .
ok , again .
stay , give me drink .
propn , this pearl is your , here 's to your health .
give him the cup .
i ’ ll play this bout first , put it aside a while .
come on .
a touch , a touch , i do confess .
our son shall win .
he 's fat , and out of breath .
the queen drinks to your fortune , propn .
good madam !
propn , do n ’ t drink .
i will , my lord , i beg you to pardon me .
it is the poisoned cup ; it is too late .
i dare not drink yet , madam , by and by .
come , let me wipe your face .
my lord , i ’ ll hit him now .
i do n ’ t think so .
and yet it is almost against my conscience .
come , for the third , propn .
you say so ?
come on .
nothing , neither way .
i ’ ll attack you now !
part them .
they are in a rage .
look to the queen there , ho !
they bleed on both sides .
how are you , my lord ?
how are you , propn ?
why , as a woodpecker caught in my own trap , propn .
i am justly killed with my own wickedness .
how is the propn ?
she swoons to see them bleed .
no , no !
i am poisoned .
o villainy !
ho !
let the doors be locked .
wickedness !
find it !
it is here , propn .
propn , you are killed , no medicine in the world can save you .
the evil deed has turned itself on me .
propn , here i lie , never to rise again .
your mother 's poisoned .
i can do no more .
the propn , the propn 's to blame .
the point poisoned too !
then , venom , do your work .
treason !
treason !
o , still defend me , friends !
i am only hurt .
here , you incestuous , murderous , damned propn , drink this potion .
is your marriage here ?
follow my mother .
exchange forgiveness with me , noble propn .
and i am not guilty of yours .
propn forgive you for it !
i follow you .
i am dead , propn .
wretched queen , goodbye !
never believe it .
i am more an antique propn than a propn .
here 's some poison wine still left .
o good propn , what a wounded name that is , things left unknown like this , shall live after me !
if you ever did hold me in your heart , stay away from happy things for a while , and , in this harsh world , draw your breath in pain to tell my story .
what warlike noise is this ?
propn propn , after conquering propn , gives this warlike volley to the ambassadors of propn .
i can not live to hear the news from propn , but i do predict that the throne belongs to propn .
now a noble heart breaks .
good night , sweet prince , and flights of angels sing you to your rest !
why does the drum come here ?
where is this sight ?
what do you want to see ?
if anything of sorrow or wonder , stop your search .
this scene is chaotic .
o proud death , what feast is being held in your eternal cell , that you have killed so many princes so bloodily all at the same time ?
the sight is sad , and our affairs come too late from propn .
the ears that should give us hearing ca n ’ t hear , to tell him his order is obeyed , that propn and propn are dead .
who will thank us ?
no thanks from his mouth , if it were alive to thank you .
he never gave orders for their deaths .
but since , you from the propn wars , and you from propn , are here arrived , and so jump on this bloody question , give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view , and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about .
so you shall hear of carnal , bloody and unnatural acts , of accidental judgments , casual slaughters , of deaths planned by cunning and false causes , and , in this result , mistaken motives fallen on the planners ' heads .
i can truly deliver all this .
let us hurry to hear it , and call the noblest to hear it too .
as for me , i embrace my fortune with sorrow .
i have some rights of past history in this kingdom , which now invites me to claim my place .
i shall also have cause to speak of that , and directly from his mouth whose voice will deliver it .
but let this speaking be done now , even while men 's minds are wild , lest more mischance on plots and errors happen .
let four captains propn propn like a soldier to the platform , for he was likely , had he been propn , to have proved most royal , and , for his passage , the soldiers ' music and the rites of war will speak loudly for him .
take up the bodies .
