<SOS> what ’ s the matter , lieutenant ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle . <EOS>
<SOS> beat me ? <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou prate , rogue ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , good lieutenant ! <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , sir , hold your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> let me go , sir , or i ’ ll knock you o'er the mazzard . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come , you ’ re drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> drunk ? <EOS>
<SOS> alas , propn help , ho ! — propn — propn , propn propn , propn ’ s a goodly watch indeed ! <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s that which rings the bell ? — diablo , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> the town will rise . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn , lieutenant , you ’ ll be ashamed for ever . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter here ? <EOS>
<SOS> he dies ! <EOS>
<SOS> hold , for your lives ! <EOS>
<SOS> hold , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> hold ! <EOS>
<SOS> the general speaks to you . <EOS>
<SOS> hold , for shame ! <EOS>
<SOS> for christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl . <EOS>
<SOS> he that stirs next to carve for his own rage propn his soul light , he dies upon his motion . <EOS>
<SOS> silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle from her propriety . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter , propn propn propn , that looks dead with grieving , speak , who began this ? <EOS>
<SOS> on thy love , i charge thee . <EOS>
<SOS> i do not know . <EOS>
<SOS> swords out , and tilting one at other ’ s breasts in opposition bloody . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not speak any beginning to this peevish odds , and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , you were wo nt be civil . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night - brawler ? <EOS>
<SOS> give me answer to it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , i am hurt to danger . <EOS>
<SOS> nor know i aught by me that ’ s said or done amiss this night , unless self - charity be sometimes a vice , and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us . <EOS>
<SOS> now , by propn , my blood begins my safer guides to rule , and passion , having my best judgment collied , propn to lead the way . <EOS>
<SOS> propn monstrous . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , who began propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> touch me not so near . <EOS>
<SOS> i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him . <EOS>
<SOS> when i came back— for this was brief— i found them close together at blow and thrust , even as again they were when you yourself did part them . <EOS>
<SOS> more of this matter can not i report . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn did some little wrong to him , as men in rage strike those that wish them best , yet surely propn , i believe , received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll make thee an example . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter , dear ? <EOS>
<SOS> all propn well , sweeting , come away to propn myself will be your surgeon . <EOS>
<SOS> what , are you hurt , lieutenant ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , past all surgery . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn forbid ! <EOS>
<SOS> but thou must needs be sure my spirits and my place have in their power to make this bitter to thee . <EOS>
<SOS> patience , good sir . <EOS>
<SOS> what tell ’ st thou me of robbing ? <EOS>
<SOS> because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you ’ ll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll have your nephews neigh to you . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans . <EOS>
<SOS> what profane wretch art thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the propn are now making the beast with two backs . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art a villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> you are a senator ! <EOS>
<SOS> this thou shalt answer . <EOS>
<SOS> i know thee , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i will answer any thing . <EOS>
<SOS> reputation , reputation , reputation ! <EOS>
<SOS> my reputation , propn , my reputation ! <EOS>
<SOS> as i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound . <EOS>
<SOS> there is more sense in that than in reputation . <EOS>
<SOS> you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser . <EOS>
<SOS> what , man , there are ways to recover the general again . <EOS>
<SOS> propn to him again and he ’ s yours . <EOS>
<SOS> drunk ? <EOS>
<SOS> and speak parrot ? <EOS>
<SOS> and squabble ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> and discourse fustian with one ’ s own shadow ? <EOS>
<SOS> o thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil ! <EOS>
<SOS> what was he that you followed with your sword ? <EOS>
<SOS> what had he done to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know not . <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> i remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly . <EOS>
<SOS> a quarrel , but nothing wherefore . <EOS>
<SOS> that we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , but you are now well enough . <EOS>
<SOS> how came you thus recovered ? <EOS>
<SOS> one unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself . <EOS>
<SOS> come , you are too severe a moraler . <EOS>
<SOS> as the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , i could heartily wish this had not befallen . <EOS>
<SOS> but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good . <EOS>
<SOS> i will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me i am a drunkard . <EOS>
<SOS> had i as many mouths as propn , such an answer would stop them all . <EOS>
<SOS> to be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , strange ! <EOS>
<SOS> every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used . <EOS>
<SOS> propn no more against it . <EOS>
<SOS> and , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you . <EOS>
<SOS> i have well approved it , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i drunk ! <EOS>
<SOS> you or any man living may be drunk at a time , man . <EOS>
<SOS> i tell you what you shall do . <EOS>
<SOS> our general ’ s wife is now the general . <EOS>
<SOS> confess yourself freely to her , importune her help to put you in your place again . <EOS>
<SOS> she is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested . <EOS>
<SOS> this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before . <EOS>
<SOS> you advise me well . <EOS>
<SOS> i protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness . <EOS>
<SOS> i think it freely , and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous propn to undertake for me . <EOS>
<SOS> i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me . <EOS>
<SOS> you are in the right . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , lieutenant , i must to the watch . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , honest iago . <EOS>
<SOS> and what ’ s he then that says i play the villain ? <EOS>
<SOS> when this advice is free i give and honest , propn to thinking and indeed the course to win the propn again ? <EOS>
<SOS> for ’ tis most easy propn ' inclining propn to subdue in any honest suit . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s framed as fruitful as the free elements . <EOS>
<SOS> how am i then a villain to counsel propn to this parallel course , directly to his good ? <EOS>
<SOS> when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now . <EOS>
<SOS> and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> my money is almost spent , i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled , and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains . <EOS>
<SOS> and so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> how poor are they that have not patience ! <EOS>
<SOS> what wound did ever heal but by degrees ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou know ’ st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , and wit depends on dilatory time . <EOS>
<SOS> does ’ t not go well ? <EOS>
<SOS> in troth , ’ tis morning . <EOS>
<SOS> pleasure and action make the hours seem short . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thee , go where thou art billeted . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , get thee gone . <EOS>
<SOS> two things are to be done : my wife must move for propn to her mistress . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll set her on . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , that ’ s the way . <EOS>
<SOS> masters , play here , i will content your pains . <EOS>
<SOS> are these , i pray you , wind instruments ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , marry , are they , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , thereby hangs a tail . <EOS>
<SOS> whereby hangs a tale , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , sir , we will not . <EOS>
<SOS> if you have any music that may not be heard , to propn again . <EOS>
<SOS> but , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care . <EOS>
<SOS> we have none such , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> then put up your pipes in your bag , for i ’ ll away . <EOS>
<SOS> go , vanish into air , away ! <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou hear , my honest friend ? <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , keep up thy quillets . <EOS>
<SOS> she is stirring , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> if she will stir hither , i shall seem to notify unto her . <EOS>
<SOS> in happy time , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you have not been abed , then ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , no . <EOS>
<SOS> my suit to her is that she will to virtuous propn procure me some access . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly thank you for ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow , good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sorry for your displeasure , but all will sure be well . <EOS>
<SOS> the general and his wife are talking of it , and she speaks for you stoutly . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn replies that he you hurt is of great fame in propn and great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you . <EOS>
<SOS> but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again . <EOS>
<SOS> yet i beseech you , if you think fit , or that it may be done , give me advantage of some brief discourse with propn alone . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you come in . <EOS>
<SOS> i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely . <EOS>
<SOS> i am much bound to you . <EOS>
<SOS> these letters give , propn , to the pilot , and by him do my duties to the senate . <EOS>
<SOS> that done , i will be walking on the works , propn there to me . <EOS>
<SOS> well , my good lord , i ’ ll do propn . <EOS>
<SOS> this fortification , gentlemen , shall we see propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll wait upon your lordship . <EOS>
<SOS> be thou assured , good propn , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf . <EOS>
<SOS> good madam , do . <EOS>
<SOS> do not doubt , propn , but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were . <EOS>
<SOS> you do love my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , but , lady , that policy may either last so long , or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , or breed itself so out of circumstances , that , i being absent and my place supplied , my general will forget my love and service . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord shall never rest , i ’ ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience . <EOS>
<SOS> but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke . <EOS>
<SOS> do not believe that , from the sense of all civility , i thus would play and trifle with your reverence . <EOS>
<SOS> if she be in her chamber or your house , let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you . <EOS>
<SOS> strike on the tinder , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> give me a taper , call up all my people ! <EOS>
<SOS> this accident is not unlike my dream , propn of it oppresses me already . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i say , light ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , for i must leave you . <EOS>
<SOS> it seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , to be producted ( as , if i stay , i shall ) against the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> in which regard , <EOS>
<SOS> therefore be merry , propn , for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , here comes my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i ’ ll take my leave . <EOS>
<SOS> why , stay and hear me speak . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , not now . <EOS>
<SOS> i am very ill at ease , propn for mine own purposes . <EOS>
<SOS> well , do your discretion . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> i like not that . <EOS>
<SOS> what dost thou say ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , my lord , or if — i know not what . <EOS>
<SOS> was not that propn parted from my wife ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do believe ’ twas he . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have been talking with a suitor here , a man that languishes in your displeasure . <EOS>
<SOS> who is ’ t you mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , your lieutenant , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> good my lord , if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , call him back . <EOS>
<SOS> went he hence now ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , sooth , so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him . <EOS>
<SOS> good love , call him back . <EOS>
<SOS> not now , sweet propn . <EOS>
<SOS> some other time . <EOS>
<SOS> but shall propn be shortly ? <EOS>
<SOS> the sooner , sweet , for you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn be tonight at supper ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , not tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow dinner , then ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , then , tomorrow night , or propn morn . <EOS>
<SOS> on propn noon , or night , or propn morn . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee name the time , but let it not exceed three days . <EOS>
<SOS> in faith , he ’ s penitent , and yet his trespass , in our common reason ( save that , they say , the wars must make example out of her best ) is not , almost , a fault propn ' incur a private check . <EOS>
<SOS> when shall he come ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell me , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> trust me , i could do propn propn , no more . <EOS>
<SOS> let him come when he will , i will deny thee nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> why , this is not a boon , ' propn as i should entreat you wear your gloves , or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted . <EOS>
<SOS> i will deny thee nothing ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn i do beseech thee , grant me this , to leave me but a little to myself . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i deny you ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll come to thee straight . <EOS>
<SOS> perdition catch my soul but i do love thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> my noble lord— what dost thou say , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> did propn propn , when you wooed my lady , propn of your love ? <EOS>
<SOS> he did , from first to last . <EOS>
<SOS> why dost thou ask ? <EOS>
<SOS> why of thy thought , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i did not think he had been acquainted with her . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed ? <EOS>
<SOS> indeed ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , indeed ! <EOS>
<SOS> discern ’ st thou aught in that ? <EOS>
<SOS> is he not honest ? <EOS>
<SOS> honest , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> honest , ay , honest . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , for aught i know . <EOS>
<SOS> what dost thou think ? <EOS>
<SOS> think , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> think , my lord ? ” alas , thou echo ’ st me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown . <EOS>
<SOS> thou dost mean something . <EOS>
<SOS> i heard thee say even now thou propn not that when propn left my wife . <EOS>
<SOS> what didst not like ? <EOS>
<SOS> and when i told thee he was of my counsel of my whole course of wooing , thou cried ’ st “ indeed ? ” and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou dost love me show me thy thought . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , you know i love you . <EOS>
<SOS> i think thou dost . <EOS>
<SOS> for propn propn , i dare be sworn , i think , that he is honest . <EOS>
<SOS> i think so too . <EOS>
<SOS> men should be what they seem , or those that be not , would they might seem none ! <EOS>
<SOS> certain , men should be what they seem . <EOS>
<SOS> why then i think propn propn an honest man . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , yet there ’ s more in this . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings , as thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words . <EOS>
<SOS> utter my thoughts ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou dost conspire against thy friend , propn , if thou but think ’ st him wronged and propn his ear a stranger to thy thoughts . <EOS>
<SOS> what dost thou mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> good name in man and woman , dear my lord , is the immediate jewel of their souls . <EOS>
<SOS> who steals my purse steals trash . <EOS>
<SOS> propn something , nothing : ' twas mine , ’ tis his , and has been slave to thousands . <EOS>
<SOS> but he that filches from me my good name propn me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll know thy thoughts . <EOS>
<SOS> you can not , if my heart were in your hand , nor shall not , whilst ’ tis in my custody . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , beware , my lord , of jealousy ! <EOS>
<SOS> it is the green - eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , misery ! <EOS>
<SOS> poor and content is rich , and rich enough , but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor . <EOS>
<SOS> good propn , the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , why is this ? <EOS>
<SOS> think ’ st thou i ’ d make a life of jealousy , to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions ? <EOS>
<SOS> no ! <EOS>
<SOS> to be once in doubt is to be resolved . <EOS>
<SOS> propn not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances . <EOS>
<SOS> where virtue is , these are more virtuous . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore , as i am bound , receive it from me . <EOS>
<SOS> i speak not yet of proof . <EOS>
<SOS> look to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i know our country disposition well . <EOS>
<SOS> in propn they do let propn see the pranks they dare not show their husbands . <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou say so ? <EOS>
<SOS> and so she did . <EOS>
<SOS> why , go to then . <EOS>
<SOS> she that , so young , could give out such a seeming , to seel her father ’ s eyes up close as oak , he thought ’ twas witchcraft . <EOS>
<SOS> but i am much to blame . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you . <EOS>
<SOS> i am bound to thee forever . <EOS>
<SOS> i see this hath a little dashed your spirits . <EOS>
<SOS> not a jot , not a jot . <EOS>
<SOS> trust me , i fear it has . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love . <EOS>
<SOS> but i do see you ’ re moved . <EOS>
<SOS> i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not . <EOS>
<SOS> should you do so , my lord , my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aimed not at . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s my worthy friend— my lord , i see you ’ re moved . <EOS>
<SOS> no , not much moved . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> if more thou dost perceive , let me know more . <EOS>
<SOS> set on thy wife to observe . <EOS>
<SOS> leave me , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i take my leave . <EOS>
<SOS> note if your lady strain his entertainment <EOS>
<SOS> that you shall surely find him , lead to the propn the raisèd search , and there will i be with him . <EOS>
<SOS> it is too true an evil . <EOS>
<SOS> gone she is . <EOS>
<SOS> and what ’ s to come of my despisèd time is naught but bitterness . <EOS>
<SOS> now , propn , where didst thou see her ? — oh , unhappy girl ! — with the propn , propn thou ? — who would be a father ? — how didst thou know ’ twas she ? — oh , she deceives me past thought ! —what said she to you ? — get more tapers , raise all my kindred . <EOS>
<SOS> are they married , think you ? <EOS>
<SOS> truly , i think they are . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , how got she out ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , treason of the blood ! <EOS>
<SOS> fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds by what you see them act . <EOS>
<SOS> is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused ? <EOS>
<SOS> have you not read , propn , of some such thing ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , sir , i have indeed . <EOS>
<SOS> i think i can discover him , if you please to get good guard and go along with me . <EOS>
<SOS> with any strong or vehement importunity . <EOS>
<SOS> much will be seen in that . <EOS>
<SOS> in the meantime , let me be thought too busy in my fears— as worthy cause i have to fear i am— and hold her free , i do beseech your honor . <EOS>
<SOS> fear not my government . <EOS>
<SOS> i once more take my leave . <EOS>
<SOS> this fellow propn of exceeding honesty and knows all quantities , with a learnèd spirit , of human dealings . <EOS>
<SOS> if i do prove her haggard , though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , i ’ d whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites ! <EOS>
<SOS> i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others ' uses . <EOS>
<SOS> yet ’ tis the plague to great ones , prerogatived are they less than the base . <EOS>
<SOS> propn destiny unshunnable , like death . <EOS>
<SOS> even then this forkèd plague is fated to us when we do quicken . <EOS>
<SOS> look where she comes . <EOS>
<SOS> if she be false , propn mocked itself . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll not believe propn . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , my dear othello ? <EOS>
<SOS> your dinner , and the generous islanders by you invited , do attend your presence . <EOS>
<SOS> i am to blame . <EOS>
<SOS> why do you speak so faintly ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you not well ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have a pain upon my forehead , here . <EOS>
<SOS> why that ’ s with watching , ’ twill away again . <EOS>
<SOS> let me but bind it hard , within this hour it will be well . <EOS>
<SOS> come , i ’ ll go in with you . <EOS>
<SOS> i am very sorry that you are not well . <EOS>
<SOS> my wayward husband hath a hundred times <EOS>
<SOS> propn me to steal it , but she so loves the token ( for he conjured her she should ever keep it ) that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll have the work ta'en out and give propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what he will do with it propn knows , not i. i nothing but to please his fantasy . <EOS>
<SOS> how now ! <EOS>
<SOS> what do you here alone ? <EOS>
<SOS> do not you chide . <EOS>
<SOS> i have a thing for you . <EOS>
<SOS> a thing for me ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is a common thing— ha ? <EOS>
<SOS> to have a foolish wife . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , is that all ? <EOS>
<SOS> what will you give me now for the same handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> what handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> what handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , that the propn first gave to propn , that which so often you did bid me steal . <EOS>
<SOS> propn stolen it from her ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , but she let it drop by negligence and , to th ' advantage , i being here , took propn up . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here it is . <EOS>
<SOS> a good wench , give it me . <EOS>
<SOS> what will you do with propn , that you have been so earnest to have me filch it ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , what is that to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> if it be not for some purpose of import , give ’ t me again . <EOS>
<SOS> poor lady , she ’ ll run mad when she shall lack it . <EOS>
<SOS> go , leave me . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn already changes with my poison . <EOS>
<SOS> look , where he comes . <EOS>
<SOS> not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , propn ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday . <EOS>
<SOS> false to me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i swear ’ tis better to be much abused than but to know propn a little . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> what sense had i in her stol'n hours of lust ? <EOS>
<SOS> i saw propn not , thought it not , it harmed not me . <EOS>
<SOS> i slept the next night well , fed well , was free and merry . <EOS>
<SOS> i found not propn ’ s kisses on her lips . <EOS>
<SOS> he that is robbed , not wanting what is stol'n , let him not know ’ t , and he ’ s not robbed at all . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sorry to hear this . <EOS>
<SOS> i had been happy if the general camp , propn and all , had tasted her sweet body , so i had nothing known . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , now forever propn the tranquil mind ! <EOS>
<SOS> farewell content ! <EOS>
<SOS> farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , farewell ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn the neighing steed and the shrill trump , the spirit - stirring drum , th ' ear - piercing fife , the royal banner , and all quality , propn , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war ! <EOS>
<SOS> and o you mortal engines , whose rude throats the immortal propn ’ s dead clamors counterfeit , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s occupation ’ s gone . <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t possible , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> is propn come to this ? <EOS>
<SOS> make me to see propn , or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn forgive me ! <EOS>
<SOS> are you a man ? <EOS>
<SOS> have you a soul or sense ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn buy you , take mine office . <EOS>
<SOS> o monstrous world ! <EOS>
<SOS> take note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , stay . <EOS>
<SOS> thou shouldst be honest . <EOS>
<SOS> i should be wise , for honesty propn a fool and loses that it works for . <EOS>
<SOS> by the world , i think my wife be honest and think she is not . <EOS>
<SOS> i think that thou art just and think thou art not . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll have some proof . <EOS>
<SOS> her name , that was as fresh as propn ’ s visage , is now begrimed and black as mine own face . <EOS>
<SOS> would i were satisfied ! <EOS>
<SOS> i see , sir , you are eaten up with passion . <EOS>
<SOS> i do repent me that i put it to you . <EOS>
<SOS> you would be satisfied ? <EOS>
<SOS> would ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , and i will . <EOS>
<SOS> and may , but how ? <EOS>
<SOS> how satisfied , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , propn her topped ? <EOS>
<SOS> death and damnation ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> it were a tedious difficulty , i think , to bring them to that prospect . <EOS>
<SOS> what shall i say ? <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s satisfaction ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is impossible you should see this , were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , as salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> but yet , i say , if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction , you may have propn . <EOS>
<SOS> give me a living reason she ’ s disloyal . <EOS>
<SOS> i do not like the office . <EOS>
<SOS> but , sith i am entered in this cause so far , pricked to propn by foolish honesty and love , i will go on . <EOS>
<SOS> i lay with propn lately and , being troubled with a raging tooth , i could not sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> monstrous ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , this was but his dream . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream . <EOS>
<SOS> and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll tear her all to pieces ! <EOS>
<SOS> tell me but this , have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife ’ s hand ? <EOS>
<SOS> if it be that— if it be that , or any that was hers , it speaks against her with the other proofs . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives ! <EOS>
<SOS> one is too poor , too weak for my revenge . <EOS>
<SOS> now do i see ’ tis true . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , bosom , with thy fraught , for ’ tis of aspics ' tongues ! <EOS>
<SOS> patience , i say . <EOS>
<SOS> your mind may change . <EOS>
<SOS> never , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> now , by yon marble propn , in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words . <EOS>
<SOS> do not rise yet . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you ever - burning lights above , you elements that clip us round about , propn that here propn doth give up the execution of his wit , hands , heart , to wronged propn ’ s service . <EOS>
<SOS> let him command , and to obey shall be in me remorse , what bloody business ever . <EOS>
<SOS> i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous , and will upon the instant put thee to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> within these three days let me hear thee say that propn ’ s not alive . <EOS>
<SOS> but let her live . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , damn her , damn her ! <EOS>
<SOS> come , go with me apart . <EOS>
<SOS> i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil . <EOS>
<SOS> now art thou my lieutenant . <EOS>
<SOS> i am your own for ever . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you lead on . <EOS>
<SOS> at every house i ’ ll call . <EOS>
<SOS> i will deserve your pains . <EOS>
<SOS> why , man ? <EOS>
<SOS> go to . <EOS>
<SOS> where lodges he ? <EOS>
<SOS> to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie . <EOS>
<SOS> can anything be made of this ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here , or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat . <EOS>
<SOS> can you inquire him out and be edified by report ? <EOS>
<SOS> seek him , bid him come hither . <EOS>
<SOS> tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well . <EOS>
<SOS> to do this is within the compass of man propn wit , and therefore i will attempt the doing it . <EOS>
<SOS> where should i lose that handkerchief , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know not , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> believe me , i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes . <EOS>
<SOS> and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are , it were enough to put him to ill thinking . <EOS>
<SOS> is he not jealous ? <EOS>
<SOS> who , he ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think the sun where he was born propn all such humors from him . <EOS>
<SOS> look where he comes . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not leave him now till propn be called to him .— how is propn with you , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> hot , hot , and moist . <EOS>
<SOS> this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty , fasting , and prayer , <EOS>
<SOS> much castigation , exercise devout , for here ’ s a young and sweating devil here , that commonly rebels . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a good hand , a frank one . <EOS>
<SOS> the hearts of old gave hands , but our new heraldry is hands , not hearts . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not speak of this . <EOS>
<SOS> come now , your promise . <EOS>
<SOS> what promise , chuck ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have sent to bid propn come speak with you . <EOS>
<SOS> i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me . <EOS>
<SOS> lend me thy handkerchief . <EOS>
<SOS> here , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> that which i gave you . <EOS>
<SOS> i have it not about me . <EOS>
<SOS> not ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , indeed , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s a fault . <EOS>
<SOS> the thoughts of people . <EOS>
<SOS> she told her , while she kept it ' twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love , but if she lost it or made gift of it , my father ’ s eye should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt after new fancies . <EOS>
<SOS> she , dying , gave it me and bid me , when my fate would have me wived , to give it her . <EOS>
<SOS> i did so , and take heed on propn , make it a darling like your precious eye . <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn true . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s magic in the web of it . <EOS>
<SOS> a sibyl , that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses , in her prophetic fury sewed the work . <EOS>
<SOS> the worms were hallowed that did breed the silk , and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful propn of maidens ' hearts . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed ? <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t true ? <EOS>
<SOS> most veritable , therefore look to propn well . <EOS>
<SOS> then would to propn that i had never seen propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> wherefore ? <EOS>
<SOS> why do you speak so startingly and rash ? <EOS>
<SOS> is propn lost ? <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t gone ? <EOS>
<SOS> speak , is propn out o ' th ' way ? <EOS>
<SOS> bless us ! <EOS>
<SOS> say you ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is not lost , but what and if it were ? <EOS>
<SOS> how ! <EOS>
<SOS> i say , it is not lost . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , let propn be received again . <EOS>
<SOS> fetch me the handkerchief — my mind misgives . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come , you ’ ll never meet a more sufficient man . <EOS>
<SOS> the handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> away ! <EOS>
<SOS> is not this man jealous ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ne'er saw this before . <EOS>
<SOS> they are all but stomachs , and we all but food . <EOS>
<SOS> to eat us hungerly , and when they are full , they belch us . <EOS>
<SOS> look you , propn and my husband ! <EOS>
<SOS> there is no other way . <EOS>
<SOS> propn she must do propn , and , propn , the happiness ! <EOS>
<SOS> go and importune her . <EOS>
<SOS> so shall i clothe me in a forced content , and shut myself up in some other course , to fortune ’ s alms . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord is not my lord , nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered . <EOS>
<SOS> so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech . <EOS>
<SOS> you must awhile be patient . <EOS>
<SOS> what i can do i will , and more i will than for myself i dare . <EOS>
<SOS> let that suffice you . <EOS>
<SOS> is my lord angry ? <EOS>
<SOS> can he be angry ? <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s matter in propn indeed , if he be angry . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , do so . <EOS>
<SOS> something , sure , of state , either from propn , or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in propn to him , propn puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases propn ’ s natures wrangle with inferior things , though great ones are their object . <EOS>
<SOS> propn even so , for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , we must think men are not gods , nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal . <EOS>
<SOS> pray propn it be state matters , as you think , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn the day ! <EOS>
<SOS> i never gave him cause . <EOS>
<SOS> but jealous souls will not be answered so . <EOS>
<SOS> they are not ever jealous for the cause , but jealous for they ’ re jealous . <EOS>
<SOS> it is a monster propn upon itself , born on itself . <EOS>
<SOS> propn keep the monster from propn ’ s mind ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , amen . <EOS>
<SOS> i will go seek him .— propn , walk hereabout . <EOS>
<SOS> if i do find him fit , i ’ ll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly thank your ladyship . <EOS>
<SOS> save you , friend propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> what make you from home ? <EOS>
<SOS> how is propn with you , my most fair propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> indeed , sweet love , i was coming to your house . <EOS>
<SOS> and i was going to your lodging , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what , keep a week away ? <EOS>
<SOS> seven days and nights ? <EOS>
<SOS> eight score eight hours ? <EOS>
<SOS> and lovers ' absent hours more tedious than the dial eightscore times ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh weary reckoning ! <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , whence came this ? <EOS>
<SOS> is propn come to this ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , well . <EOS>
<SOS> go to , woman , throw your vile guesses in the devil ’ s teeth from whence you have them . <EOS>
<SOS> why , whose is it ? <EOS>
<SOS> i like the work well . <EOS>
<SOS> propn it be demanded , as like enough it will , i would have it copied . <EOS>
<SOS> take it and do propn , and leave me for this time . <EOS>
<SOS> leave you ! <EOS>
<SOS> wherefore ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do attend here on the general and think it no addition , nor my wish , to have him see me womaned . <EOS>
<SOS> why , i pray you ? <EOS>
<SOS> not that i love you not . <EOS>
<SOS> but that you do not love me . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night . <EOS>
<SOS> propn but a little way that i can bring you , for i attend here . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll see you soon . <EOS>
<SOS> propn very good . <EOS>
<SOS> i must be circumstanced . <EOS>
<SOS> nine or ten times i had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs . <EOS>
<SOS> propn better as it is . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that , with the little godliness i have , i did full hard forbear him . <EOS>
<SOS> let him do his spite . <EOS>
<SOS> my services which i have done the signiory propn out - tongue his complaints . <EOS>
<SOS> will you think so ? <EOS>
<SOS> think so , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , to kiss in private ? <EOS>
<SOS> an unauthorized kiss ! <EOS>
<SOS> or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ? <EOS>
<SOS> naked in bed , propn , and not mean harm ! <EOS>
<SOS> it is hypocrisy against the devil . <EOS>
<SOS> so they do nothing , ’ tis a venial slip . <EOS>
<SOS> but if i give my wife a handkerchief— what then ? <EOS>
<SOS> she is protectress of her honor too . <EOS>
<SOS> may she give that ? <EOS>
<SOS> but for the handkerchief— by propn , i would most gladly have forgot it . <EOS>
<SOS> thou saidst — oh , it comes o'er my memory , as doth the raven o'er the infectious house , boding to all — he had my handkerchief . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , what of that ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s not so good now . <EOS>
<SOS> what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ? <EOS>
<SOS> he hath , my lord , but be you well assured no more than he ’ ll unswear . <EOS>
<SOS> what hath he said ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , that he did — i know not what he did . <EOS>
<SOS> lie— with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> with her , on her , what you will . <EOS>
<SOS> lie with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> lie on her ? <EOS>
<SOS> lie with her — that ’ s fulsome . <EOS>
<SOS> handkerchief — confessions — handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> noses , ears , and lips . <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> confess ! —handkerchief ! —oh , devil ! — work on , my medicine , work ! <EOS>
<SOS> how now , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> this is his second fit . <EOS>
<SOS> he had one yesterday . <EOS>
<SOS> rub him about the temples . <EOS>
<SOS> no , forbear . <EOS>
<SOS> if not , he foams at mouth and by and by propn out to savage madness . <EOS>
<SOS> look , he stirs . <EOS>
<SOS> do you withdraw yourself a little while , <EOS>
<SOS> when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you . <EOS>
<SOS> how is it , general ? <EOS>
<SOS> have you not hurt your head ? <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou mock me ? <EOS>
<SOS> would you would bear your fortune like a man ! <EOS>
<SOS> a hornèd man propn a monster and a beast . <EOS>
<SOS> did he confess it ? <EOS>
<SOS> good sir , be a man , think every bearded fellow that ’ s but yoked may draw with you . <EOS>
<SOS> your case is better . <EOS>
<SOS> no , let me know , and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , thou art wise ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn certain . <EOS>
<SOS> whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief— a passion most resulting such a man— propn came hither . <EOS>
<SOS> i shifted him away and laid good ’ scuses upon your ecstasy , <EOS>
<SOS> bade him anon return and here speak with me , the which he promised . <EOS>
<SOS> for i will make him tell the tale anew where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when he hath , and is again to cope your wife . <EOS>
<SOS> i say , but mark his gesture . <EOS>
<SOS> marry , patience , or i shall say you are all in all in spleen , and nothing of a man . <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou hear , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> will you withdraw ? <EOS>
<SOS> now will i question propn of propn , a huswife that by selling her desires propn herself bread and clothes . <EOS>
<SOS> it is a creature that dotes on propn , as ’ tis the strumpet ’ s plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one . <EOS>
<SOS> he , when he hears of her , can not refrain from the excess of laughter . <EOS>
<SOS> as he shall smile , propn shall go mad . <EOS>
<SOS> and his unbookish jealousy must construe propn propn ’ s smiles , gestures , and light behavior propn in the wrong .— how do you now , lieutenant ? <EOS>
<SOS> alas , poor caitiff ! <EOS>
<SOS> look how he laughs already ! <EOS>
<SOS> i never knew woman love man so . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , poor rogue , i think indeed she loves me . <EOS>
<SOS> now he denies it faintly , and laughs it out . <EOS>
<SOS> do you hear , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> now he importunes him to tell it o'er . <EOS>
<SOS> go to , well said , well said . <EOS>
<SOS> she gives it out that you shall marry her . <EOS>
<SOS> do you intend it ? <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> do you triumph ? <EOS>
<SOS> i marry her ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ? <EOS>
<SOS> prithee bear some charity to my wit . <EOS>
<SOS> do not think it so unwholesome . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> so , so , so , so ! <EOS>
<SOS> prithee say true ! <EOS>
<SOS> well . <EOS>
<SOS> she is persuaded i will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise . <EOS>
<SOS> iago beckons me . <EOS>
<SOS> now he begins the story . <EOS>
<SOS> she was here even now . <EOS>
<SOS> she haunts me in every place . <EOS>
<SOS> i was the other day talking on the sea - bank with certain propn , and thither comes the bauble and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck— crying “ o dear propn ! ” as it were . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber . <EOS>
<SOS> look , where she comes . <EOS>
<SOS> propn such another fitchew . <EOS>
<SOS> what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ? <EOS>
<SOS> i was a fine fool to take it . <EOS>
<SOS> i must take out the work ? <EOS>
<SOS> a likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber , and not know who left it there ! <EOS>
<SOS> this is some minx ’ s token , and i must take out the work ? <EOS>
<SOS> how now , my sweet propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> how now , how now ? <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , that should be my handkerchief ! <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ ll come to supper tonight , you may . <EOS>
<SOS> if you will not , come when you are next prepared for . <EOS>
<SOS> after her , after her . <EOS>
<SOS> i must , she ’ ll rail in the street else . <EOS>
<SOS> will you sup there ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i intend so . <EOS>
<SOS> did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ? <EOS>
<SOS> o iago ! <EOS>
<SOS> and did you see the handkerchief ? <EOS>
<SOS> was that mine ? <EOS>
<SOS> yours by this hand . <EOS>
<SOS> and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife ! <EOS>
<SOS> she gave it him , and he hath given it his whore . <EOS>
<SOS> i would have him nine years a - killing . <EOS>
<SOS> a fine woman ! <EOS>
<SOS> a fair woman ! <EOS>
<SOS> a sweet woman ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , you must forget that . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , the world hath not a sweeter creature , she might lie by an emperor ’ s side and command him tasks . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , that ’ s not your way . <EOS>
<SOS> so delicate with her needle , an admirable musician . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , she will sing the savageness out of a bear ! <EOS>
<SOS> of so high and plenteous wit and invention ! <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s the worse for all this . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , a thousand thousand times — and then of so gentle a condition ! <EOS>
<SOS> ay , too gentle . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , that ’ s certain . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , the pity of it , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> if you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for if it touch not you it comes near nobody . <EOS>
<SOS> i will chop her into messes ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , ’ tis foul in her . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s fouler . <EOS>
<SOS> get me some poison , propn , this night . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again — this night , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> do it not with poison . <EOS>
<SOS> strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated . <EOS>
<SOS> good , good , the justice of it pleases ! <EOS>
<SOS> very good ! <EOS>
<SOS> and for propn , let me be his undertaker . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall hear more by midnight . <EOS>

<SOS> something from propn as i may divine . <EOS>
<SOS> it is a business of some heat . <EOS>
<SOS> the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another ’ s heels , and many of the consuls , raised and met , are at the propn propn already . <EOS>
<SOS> you have been hotly called for . <EOS>
<SOS> when being not at your lodging to be found the propn hath sent about three several guests to search you out . <EOS>
<SOS> propn well i am found by you . <EOS>

<SOS> a most unhappy one . <EOS>
<SOS> i would do much propn ' atone them , for the love i bear to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> fire and brimstone ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you wise ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , is he angry ? <EOS>
<SOS> maybe the letter moved him , for , as i think , they do command him home , propn propn in his government . <EOS>
<SOS> trust me , i am glad on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am glad to see you mad . <EOS>

<SOS> my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> what would you with her , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> who , i , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , you did wish that i would make her turn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , and turn again . <EOS>
<SOS> and she can weep , sir , weep . <EOS>
<SOS> and she ’ s obedient , as you say , obedient , very obedient .— proceed you in your tears.— concerning this , sir — oh , well - painted passion ! — i am commanded home .— get you away , i ’ ll send for you anon .— propn , i obey the mandate and will return to propn .— hence , avaunt ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn shall have my place . <EOS>
<SOS> and , sir , tonight i do entreat that we may sup together . <EOS>
<SOS> you are welcome , sir , to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> goats and monkeys ! <EOS>
<SOS> is this the noble propn whom our full senate call all in all sufficient ? <EOS>
<SOS> he is much changed . <EOS>
<SOS> are his wits safe ? <EOS>
<SOS> is he not light of brain ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s that he is . <EOS>
<SOS> i may not breathe my censure what he might be . <EOS>
<SOS> if what he might he is not , i would to propn he were ! <EOS>
<SOS> strike his wife ? <EOS>
<SOS> faith , that was not so well . <EOS>
<SOS> yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst ! <EOS>
<SOS> is it his use ? <EOS>
<SOS> or did the letters work upon his blood and new - create his fault ? <EOS>
<SOS> alas , alas ! <EOS>
<SOS> it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known . <EOS>
<SOS> do but go after and mark how he continues . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sorry that i am deceived in him . <EOS>
<SOS> you have seen nothing then ? <EOS>
<SOS> nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , you have seen propn and she together . <EOS>
<SOS> but then i saw no harm , and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them . <EOS>
<SOS> what , did they never whisper ? <EOS>
<SOS> never , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> nor send you out o ' th ' way ? <EOS>
<SOS> never . <EOS>
<SOS> to fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ? <EOS>
<SOS> never , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s strange . <EOS>
<SOS> i durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , propn down my soul at stake . <EOS>
<SOS> bid her come hither . <EOS>
<SOS> go . <EOS>
<SOS> she says enough , yet she ’ s a simple bawd that can not say as much . <EOS>
<SOS> and yet she ’ ll kneel and pray , i have seen her do propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , what is your will ? <EOS>
<SOS> pray , chuck , come hither . <EOS>
<SOS> what is your pleasure ? <EOS>
<SOS> let me see your eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> look in my face . <EOS>
<SOS> what horrible fancy ’ s this ? <EOS>
<SOS> i understand a fury in your words , but not the words . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore be double damned , propn thou art honest ! <EOS>
<SOS> heaven doth truly know it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn truly knows that thou art false as hell . <EOS>
<SOS> to whom , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> with whom ? <EOS>
<SOS> how am i false ? <EOS>
<SOS> ah , propn , away , away , away ! <EOS>
<SOS> am i the motive of these tears , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back , propn not your blame on me . <EOS>
<SOS> if you have lost him , why , i have lost him too . <EOS>
<SOS> yet could i bear that too , well , very well . <EOS>
<SOS> but there where i have garnered up my heart , where either i must live or bear no life , the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up — to be discarded thence ! <EOS>
<SOS> or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in ! <EOS>
<SOS> turn thy complexion there , patience , thou young and rose - lipped cherubin , — ay , there , look grim as hell ! <EOS>
<SOS> i hope my noble lord esteems me honest . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , that quicken even with blowing . <EOS>
<SOS> o thou weed , who art so lovely fair and propn so sweet that the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born ! <EOS>
<SOS> alas , what ignorant sin have i committed ? <EOS>
<SOS> was this fair paper , this most goodly book , made to write “ whore ” upon ? <EOS>
<SOS> what committed ? <EOS>
<SOS> committed ? <EOS>
<SOS> o thou public commoner ! <EOS>
<SOS> what committed ? <EOS>
<SOS> impudent strumpet ! <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , you do me wrong ! <EOS>
<SOS> are you not a strumpet ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , as i am a propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what , not a whore ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , as i shall be saved . <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t possible ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn forgive us ! <EOS>
<SOS> i cry you mercy , then , i took you for that cunning whore of propn that married with propn .— you , mistress , that have the office opposite to propn propn and keep the gate of hell ! <EOS>
<SOS> you , you , ay , you ! <EOS>
<SOS> we have done our course . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s money for your pains . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , what does this gentleman conceive ? <EOS>
<SOS> how do you , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> ancient , what makes he here ? <EOS>
<SOS> faith , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack . <EOS>
<SOS> if it prove lawful prize , he ’ s made for ever . <EOS>
<SOS> i do not understand . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s married . <EOS>
<SOS> to who ? <EOS>
<SOS> here comes another troop to seek for you . <EOS>
<SOS> it is propn . <EOS>
<SOS> general , be advised , he comes to bad intent . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> stand there ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , it is the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> down with him , thief ! <EOS>
<SOS> with who ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have none . <EOS>
<SOS> do not talk to me , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s a change indeed ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn meet i should be used so , very meet . <EOS>
<SOS> how have i been behaved that he might stick the small ’ st opinion on my least misuse ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is your pleasure , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> how is propn with you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can not tell . <EOS>
<SOS> those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks . <EOS>
<SOS> he might have chid me so , for , in good faith , i am a child to chiding . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter , lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> alas , propn , my lord hath so bewhored her , propn such despite and heavy terms upon her , that true hearts can not bear it . <EOS>
<SOS> am i that name , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> what name , fair lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> such as she says my lord did say i was . <EOS>
<SOS> why did he so ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do not know . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sure i am none such . <EOS>
<SOS> do not weep , do not weep . <EOS>
<SOS> propn the day ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn she forsook so many noble matches , her father and her country , and her friends , to be called “ whore ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> would it not make one weep ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is my wretched fortune . <EOS>
<SOS> beshrew him for propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> how comes this trick upon him ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , propn doth know . <EOS>
<SOS> i will be hanged , if some eternal villain , some busy and insinuating rogue , some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , have not devised this slander . <EOS>
<SOS> i will be hanged else ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , there is no such man . <EOS>
<SOS> it is impossible . <EOS>
<SOS> if any such there be , propn pardon him ! <EOS>
<SOS> why should he call her “ whore ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> who keeps her company ? <EOS>
<SOS> the propn ’ s abused by some most villainous knave , some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow . <EOS>
<SOS> o heavens , that such companions thou ’ dst unfold , and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to th ' west ! <EOS>
<SOS> speak within door . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , fie upon them ! <EOS>
<SOS> some such squire he was that turned your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you are a fool . <EOS>
<SOS> go to . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , what shall i do to win my lord again ? <EOS>
<SOS> good friend , go to him . <EOS>
<SOS> for , by this light of propn , i know not how i lost him . <EOS>
<SOS> here i kneel : if e'er my will did trespass ' gainst his love , either in discourse of thought or actual deed , or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense , delighted them , or any other form , or that i do not yet , and ever did , <EOS>
<SOS> and ever will — though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement — love him dearly , propn forswear me ! <EOS>
<SOS> unkindness may do much , and his unkindness may defeat my life , but never taint my love . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not say “ whore , ” it does abhor me now i speak the word . <EOS>
<SOS> the business of the state does him offence , and he does chide with you . <EOS>
<SOS> if ’ twere no other— ' propn but so , i warrant . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , how these instruments summon to supper . <EOS>
<SOS> the messengers of propn stays the meat . <EOS>
<SOS> go in , and weep not . <EOS>
<SOS> all things shall be well . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> i do not find that thou propn justly with me . <EOS>
<SOS> what in the contrary ? <EOS>
<SOS> i will indeed no longer endure it , nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered . <EOS>
<SOS> will you hear me , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have heard too much , and your words and performances are no kin together . <EOS>
<SOS> you charge me most unjustly . <EOS>
<SOS> with naught but truth . <EOS>
<SOS> the jewels you have had from me to deliver propn would half have corrupted a votaress . <EOS>
<SOS> you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but i find none . <EOS>
<SOS> well , go to . <EOS>
<SOS> very well . <EOS>
<SOS> very well , ” “ go to ” ! <EOS>
<SOS> i can not go to , man , nor ’ tis not very well . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , i think it is scurvy , and begin to find myself fopped in it . <EOS>
<SOS> very well . <EOS>
<SOS> i tell you ’ tis not very well . <EOS>
<SOS> i will make myself known to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation . <EOS>
<SOS> if not , assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you . <EOS>
<SOS> you have said now . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing . <EOS>
<SOS> why , now i see there ’ s mettle in thee , and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before . <EOS>
<SOS> give me thy hand , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair . <EOS>
<SOS> it hath not appeared . <EOS>
<SOS> i grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment . <EOS>
<SOS> but , propn , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which i have greater reason to believe now than ever — i mean purpose , courage and valor — this night show it . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou the next night following enjoy not propn , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life . <EOS>
<SOS> well , what is it ? <EOS>
<SOS> is it within reason and compass ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , there is especial commission come from propn to depute propn in propn ’ s place . <EOS>
<SOS> is that true ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , then propn and propn return again to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> how do you mean , removing of him ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , by making him uncapable of propn ’ s place : knocking out his brains . <EOS>
<SOS> and that you would have me to do ! <EOS>
<SOS> ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right . <EOS>
<SOS> he sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will i go to him . <EOS>
<SOS> he knows not yet of his honorable fortune . <EOS>
<SOS> if you will watch his going thence ( which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one ) you may take him at your pleasure . <EOS>
<SOS> i will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us . <EOS>
<SOS> i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him . <EOS>
<SOS> it is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste . <EOS>
<SOS> about it ! <EOS>
<SOS> i will hear further reason for this . <EOS>
<SOS> and you shall be satisfied . <EOS>
<SOS> i do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , good night . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly thank your ladyship . <EOS>
<SOS> your honor is most welcome . <EOS>
<SOS> will you walk , sir ? — o desdemona— my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> get you to bed on th ' instant , i will be returned propn . <EOS>
<SOS> dismiss your attendant there , look propn be done . <EOS>
<SOS> i will , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> how goes it now ? <EOS>
<SOS> he looks gentler than he did . <EOS>
<SOS> dismiss me ? <EOS>
<SOS> it was his bidding . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore , good propn , give me my nightly wearing , and adieu . <EOS>
<SOS> we must not now displease him . <EOS>
<SOS> ay . <EOS>
<SOS> would you had never seen him ! <EOS>
<SOS> so would not i . <EOS>
<SOS> my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness , his checks , his propn propn , unpin me — have grace and favor . <EOS>
<SOS> i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed . <EOS>
<SOS> all ’ s one . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , how foolish are our minds ! <EOS>
<SOS> if i do die before thee , prithee , shroud me in one of these same sheets . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come ! <EOS>
<SOS> you talk ! <EOS>
<SOS> she had a song of “ propn , ” an old thing ’ twas , but it expressed her fortune and she died singing it . <EOS>
<SOS> that song tonight will not go from my mind . <EOS>
<SOS> i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbary . <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , dispatch . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i go fetch your nightgown ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , unpin me here . <EOS>
<SOS> this propn is a proper man . <EOS>
<SOS> a very handsome man . <EOS>
<SOS> he speaks well . <EOS>
<SOS> i know a lady in propn would have walked barefoot to propn for a touch of his nether lip . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s the wind . <EOS>
<SOS> mine eyes do itch , doth that bode weeping ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn neither here nor there . <EOS>
<SOS> i have heard it said so . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , these men , these men ! <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou in conscience think — tell me , emilia— that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind ? <EOS>
<SOS> there be some such , no question . <EOS>
<SOS> you , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> come , sir , i am for you . <EOS>
<SOS> good signior , you shall more command with years than with your weapons . <EOS>
<SOS> o thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her ! <EOS>
<SOS> judge me the world if ’ tis not gross in sense that thou hast practiced on her with foul charms , abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weakens motion . <EOS>
<SOS> if he do resist , propn him at his peril ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn will you that i go to answer this your charge ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou do such a deed for all the world ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , would not you ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , by this heavenly light ! <EOS>
<SOS> nor i neither , by this heavenly light . <EOS>
<SOS> i might do propn as well i ' th ' dark . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou do such a deed for all the world ? <EOS>
<SOS> the world ’ s a huge thing . <EOS>
<SOS> it is a great price for a small vice . <EOS>
<SOS> in troth , i think thou wouldst not . <EOS>
<SOS> in troth , i think i should , and undo propn when i had done . <EOS>
<SOS> marry , i would not do such a thing for a joint - ring , nor for measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition . <EOS>
<SOS> but for the whole world ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ? <EOS>
<SOS> i should venture purgatory for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> beshrew me , if i would do such a wrong for the whole world . <EOS>
<SOS> why the wrong is but a wrong i ' th ' world , and having the world for your labor , ’ tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right . <EOS>
<SOS> i do not think there is any such woman . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , a dozen , and as many to th ' vantage as would store the world they played for . <EOS>
<SOS> but i do think it is their husbands ' faults if wives do fall . <EOS>
<SOS> say that they slack their duties <EOS>
<SOS> why , we have galls , and though we have some grace , yet have we some revenge . <EOS>
<SOS> let husbands know their wives have sense like them . <EOS>
<SOS> they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour , as husbands have . <EOS>
<SOS> i think it is . <EOS>
<SOS> and doth affection breed it ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think it doth . <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t frailty that thus errs ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is so too . <EOS>
<SOS> and have not we affections , desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ? <EOS>
<SOS> then let them use us well , else let them know , the ills we do , their ills instruct us so . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , good night . <EOS>
<SOS> propn me such uses send , not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend ! <EOS>
<SOS> here , stand behind this bulk , straight will he come . <EOS>
<SOS> quick , quick ! <EOS>
<SOS> fear nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be at thy elbow . <EOS>
<SOS> it makes us , or it mars us . <EOS>
<SOS> here , at thy hand . <EOS>
<SOS> be bold , and take thy stand . <EOS>
<SOS> i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons . <EOS>
<SOS> propn but a man gone . <EOS>
<SOS> i know his gait , ’ tis he .— propn , thou diest ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i am slain ! <EOS>
<SOS> i am maimed for ever . <EOS>
<SOS> help , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> the voice of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn keeps his word . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , villain that i am ! <EOS>
<SOS> it is even so . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , help , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> light ! <EOS>
<SOS> a surgeon ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn he . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , brave propn , honest and just , that hast such noble sense of thy friend ’ s wrong ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou teachest me . <EOS>
<SOS> minion , your dear lies dead , and your unblest fate hies . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i come . <EOS>
<SOS> for , of my heart , those charms , thine eyes , are blotted . <EOS>
<SOS> thy bed , lust - stained , shall with lust ’ s blood be spotted . <EOS>
<SOS> what , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> no watch ? <EOS>
<SOS> no passage ? <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn some mischance , the cry is very direful . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , help ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , wretched villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> two or three groan . <EOS>
<SOS> propn heavy night , these may be counterfeits . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s think propn unsafe to come in to the cry without more help . <EOS>
<SOS> nobody come ? <EOS>
<SOS> then shall i bleed to death . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> whose noise is this that ones on murder ? <EOS>
<SOS> we do not know . <EOS>
<SOS> do not you hear a cry ? <EOS>
<SOS> here , here ! <EOS>
<SOS> for propn ’ s sake , help me ! <EOS>
<SOS> the same indeed , a very valiant fellow . <EOS>
<SOS> iago ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i am spoiled , undone by villains ! <EOS>
<SOS> give me some help . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , me , lieutenant ! <EOS>
<SOS> what villains have done this ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think that one of them is hereabout , and can not make away . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s one of them . <EOS>
<SOS> o damned propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> o inhuman dog ! <EOS>
<SOS> kill men i ' th ' dark ! <EOS>
<SOS> where be these bloody thieves ? <EOS>
<SOS> are you of good or evil ? <EOS>
<SOS> as you shall prove us , praise us . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> he , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i cry you mercy . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s propn hurt by villains . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> how is propn , brother ! <EOS>
<SOS> my leg is cut in two . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn forbid ! <EOS>
<SOS> light , gentlemen , i ’ ll bind it with my shirt . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter , ho ? <EOS>
<SOS> who is propn that cried ? <EOS>
<SOS> who is propn that cried ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my dear propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> my sweet propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> o notable strumpet ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , may you suspect who they should be that have thus mangled you ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sorry to find you thus . <EOS>
<SOS> i have been to seek you . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , he faints ! <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> gentlemen all , i do suspect this trash to be a party in this injury.— patience awhile , good propn .— come , come , lend me a light . <EOS>
<SOS> know we this face or no ? <EOS>
<SOS> even he , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> did you know him ? <EOS>
<SOS> know him ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay . <EOS>
<SOS> i am glad to see you . <EOS>
<SOS> how do you , propn ? — oh , a chair , a chair ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> he , he , ’ tis he . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , that ’ s well said — the chair ! <EOS>
<SOS> some good man bear him carefully from hence . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll fetch the general ’ s surgeon.— save you your labor .— he that lies slain here , propn , was my dear friend . <EOS>
<SOS> what malice was between you ? <EOS>
<SOS> none in the world , nor do i know the man . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , look upon her . <EOS>
<SOS> do you see , gentlemen ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , guiltiness will speak , though tongues were out of use . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , what is the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter , husband ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn hath here been set on in the dark by propn and fellows that are ’ scaped . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s almost slain , and propn dead . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , good gentleman ! <EOS>
<SOS> alas , good propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> this is the fruits of whoring . <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , propn , go know of propn where he supped tonight.— <EOS>
<SOS> he supped at my house , but i therefore shake not . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , did he so ? <EOS>
<SOS> i charge you , go with me . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , fie upon thee , strumpet ! <EOS>
<SOS> as i ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn upon thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> kind gentlemen , let ’ s go see poor propn dressed.— come , mistress , you must tell propn another tale . <EOS>
<SOS> emilia , run you to the citadel and tell my lord and lady what hath happed.— will you go on afore ? <EOS>
<SOS> this is the night that either makes me or fordoes me quite . <EOS>
<SOS> how may the propn be therewith satisfied , whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn true , most worthy signior . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn propn in council and your noble self , i am sure , is sent for . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn in council ? <EOS>
<SOS> in this time of the night ? <EOS>
<SOS> bring him away . <EOS>
<SOS> mine ’ s not an idle cause . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn himself , or any of my brothers of the state , can not but feel this wrong as ’ twere their own . <EOS>
<SOS> for if such actions may have passage free , bond - slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be . <EOS>
<SOS> let me not name it to you , you chaste stars , it is the cause . <EOS>
<SOS> yet i ’ ll not shed her blood , nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster . <EOS>
<SOS> yet she must die , else she ’ ll betray more men . <EOS>
<SOS> put out the light , and then put out the light . <EOS>
<SOS> if i quench thee , thou flaming minister , i can again thy former light restore should i repent me . <EOS>
<SOS> when i have plucked thy rose i can not give it vital growth again , it must needs wither . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> othello ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> will you come to bed , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord , what do you mean by that ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , do it , and be brief . <EOS>
<SOS> i will walk by . <EOS>
<SOS> i would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit . <EOS>
<SOS> no , heavens forfend , i would not kill thy soul ! <EOS>
<SOS> talk you of killing ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , i do . <EOS>
<SOS> then propn have mercy on me ! <EOS>
<SOS> amen , with all my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> if you say , i hope you will not kill me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> why i should fear i know not , since guiltiness i know not . <EOS>
<SOS> but yet i feel i fear . <EOS>
<SOS> think on thy sins . <EOS>
<SOS> they are loves i bear to you . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , and for that thou diest . <EOS>
<SOS> that death ’ s unnatural that kills for loving . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ? <EOS>
<SOS> some bloody passion shakes your very frame . <EOS>
<SOS> these are portents , but yet i hope , i hope they do not point on me . <EOS>
<SOS> i will so . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee , thou gav ’ st to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> no , by my life and soul ! <EOS>
<SOS> send for the man and ask him . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art on thy deathbed . <EOS>
<SOS> ay — but not yet to die ! <EOS>
<SOS> presently . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore confess thee freely of thy sin , for to deny each article with oath can not remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art to die . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn have mercy on me ! <EOS>
<SOS> i say “ amen . ” <EOS>
<SOS> and have you mercy too ! <EOS>
<SOS> i never gave him token . <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , i saw my handkerchief in ’ s hand . <EOS>
<SOS> o perjured woman , thou dost stone my heart , and propn me call what i intend to do a murder , which i thought a sacrifice ! <EOS>
<SOS> i saw the handkerchief . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath confessed . <EOS>
<SOS> what , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> that he hath usèd thee . <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay . <EOS>
<SOS> he will not say so . <EOS>
<SOS> no , his mouth is stopped . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn propn ta'en order for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what , is he dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , he is betrayed and i undone . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , banish me , my lord , but kill me not ! <EOS>
<SOS> kill me tomorrow — let me live tonight ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , if you strive— but half an hour ! <EOS>
<SOS> but while i say one prayer ! <EOS>
<SOS> it is too late . <EOS>
<SOS> what noise is this ? — not dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> not yet quite dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , ’ tis propn ' propn like she comes to speak of propn ’ s death , the noise was high . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter with thee now ? <EOS>
<SOS> but now , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord , hath killed a young propn called propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn killed ? <EOS>
<SOS> and propn killed ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , propn is not killed . <EOS>
<SOS> not propn killed ! <EOS>
<SOS> then murder ’ s out of tune , and sweet revenge grows harsh . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , falsely , falsely murdered ! <EOS>
<SOS> alas , what cry is that ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ? <EOS>
<SOS> out and alas , that was my lady ’ s voice . <EOS>

<SOS> i myself . <EOS>
<SOS> commend me to my kind lord . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , farewell ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , how should she be murdered ? <EOS>
<SOS> alas , who knows ? <EOS>
<SOS> you heard her say herself it was not i . <EOS>
<SOS> she said so . <EOS>
<SOS> i must needs report the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s like a liar gone to burning hell . <EOS>
<SOS> propn i that killed her . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , the more angel she , and you the blacker devil ! <EOS>
<SOS> she turned to folly , and she was a whore . <EOS>
<SOS> thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil . <EOS>
<SOS> she was false as water . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , she was heavenly true ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn did top her , ask thy husband else . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i were damned beneath all depth in hell , but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity . <EOS>
<SOS> propn husband knew it all . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn husband . <EOS>
<SOS> that she was false to wedlock ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> had she been true , if propn would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite , i ’ d not have sold her for it . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , ’ twas he that told me on her first . <EOS>
<SOS> an honest man he is , and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband ! <EOS>
<SOS> what needs this iterance , woman ? <EOS>
<SOS> i say thy husband . <EOS>
<SOS> o mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love ! <EOS>
<SOS> my husband say that she was false ! <EOS>
<SOS> he , woman . <EOS>
<SOS> i say “ thy husband ” —dost understand the word ? <EOS>
<SOS> my friend , thy husband , honest , honest iago . <EOS>
<SOS> if he say so , may his pernicious soul propn half a grain a day ! <EOS>
<SOS> he lies to th ' heart . <EOS>
<SOS> she was too fond of her most filthy bargain . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> do thy worst . <EOS>
<SOS> this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her . <EOS>
<SOS> peace , you were best . <EOS>
<SOS> o gull ! <EOS>
<SOS> o dolt ! <EOS>
<SOS> as ignorant as dirt ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou hast done a deed— i care not for thy sword , i ’ ll make thee known <EOS>
<SOS> the propn hath killed my mistress ! <EOS>
<SOS> murder , murder ! <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> how now , general ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , are you come , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> you have done well , that men must lay their murders on your neck . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> i told him what i thought , and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true . <EOS>
<SOS> but did you ever tell him she was false ? <EOS>
<SOS> i did . <EOS>
<SOS> you told a lie , an odious , damnèd lie . <EOS>
<SOS> upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie . <EOS>
<SOS> she false with propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> did you say with propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> with propn , mistress . <EOS>
<SOS> go to , charm your tongue . <EOS>
<SOS> my mistress here lies murdered in her bed— oh , heavens forfend ! <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s no composition in this news that gives them credit . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed , they are disproportioned . <EOS>
<SOS> my letters say a hundred and seven galleys . <EOS>
<SOS> and mine a hundred and forty . <EOS>
<SOS> and mine , two hundred . <EOS>
<SOS> but though they jump not on a just account— as in these cases , where the aim reports ' propn oft with difference — yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet , and bearing up to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , it is possible enough to judgment . <EOS>
<SOS> a messenger from the galleys . <EOS>
<SOS> and your reports have set the murder on . <EOS>
<SOS> i thought so then , i ’ ll kill myself for grief . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , villainy , villainy ! <EOS>
<SOS> what , are you mad ? <EOS>
<SOS> i charge you , get you home . <EOS>
<SOS> good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak . <EOS>
<SOS> propn proper i obey him , but not now . <EOS>
<SOS> perchance , propn , i will ne'er go home . <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , lay thee down and roar , for thou hast killed the sweetest innocent that e'er did lift up eye . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , she was foul ! — i scarce did know you , uncle . <EOS>
<SOS> i am glad thy father ’ s dead , propn match was mortal to him , and pure grief propn his old thread in twain . <EOS>
<SOS> did he live now , <EOS>
<SOS> this sight would make him do a desperate turn , propn , curse his better angel from his side and fall to reprobation . <EOS>
<SOS> propn pitiful , but yet propn knows that she with propn hath the act of shame a thousand times committed . <EOS>
<SOS> zounds , hold your peace . <EOS>
<SOS> let heaven and men and devils , let them all , all , all cry shame against me , yet i ’ ll speak . <EOS>
<SOS> be wise , and get you home . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not . <EOS>
<SOS> fie ! <EOS>
<SOS> your sword upon a woman ? <EOS>
<SOS> o thou dull propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> that handkerchief thou speak ’ st of i found by fortune and did give my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> for often , with a solemn earnestness— more than indeed belonged to such a trifle— he begged of me to steal it . <EOS>
<SOS> villainous whore ! <EOS>
<SOS> she give it propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , alas , i found it and i did give propn my husband . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , thou liest ! <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , i do not , i do not , gentlemen.— o murderous coxcomb ! <EOS>
<SOS> are there no stones in propn but what serve for the thunder ? — precious villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> sure he hath killed his wife . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , ay . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , lay me by my mistress ' side . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s gone , but his wife propn killed . <EOS>
<SOS> let him not pass , but kill him rather . <EOS>
<SOS> but why should honor outlive honesty ? <EOS>
<SOS> let it go all . <EOS>
<SOS> what did thy song bode , lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , canst thou hear me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i will play the swan . <EOS>
<SOS> and die in music . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , here it is . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i must come forth . <EOS>
<SOS> look in upon me then and speak with me , or , naked as i am , i will assault thee . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i have a weapon . <EOS>
<SOS> that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop . <EOS>
<SOS> but , oh , vain boast ! <EOS>
<SOS> who can control his fate ? <EOS>
<SOS> tis not so now . <EOS>
<SOS> be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed . <EOS>
<SOS> here is my journey ’ s end , here is my butt , and very sea - mark of my utmost sail . <EOS>
<SOS> do you go back dismayed ? <EOS>
<SOS> tis a lost fear . <EOS>
<SOS> where should othello go ? — now , how dost thou look now ? <EOS>
<SOS> o ill - starred wench , propn as thy smock ! <EOS>
<SOS> when we shall meet at compt this look of thine will hurl my soul from propn and fiends will snatch at it . <EOS>
<SOS> cold , cold , my girl , even like thy chastity . <EOS>
<SOS> o cursed , cursed slave ! <EOS>
<SOS> whip me , ye devils , from the possession of this heavenly sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> where is this rash and most unfortunate man ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s he that was propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here i am . <EOS>
<SOS> where is that viper ? <EOS>
<SOS> bring the villain forth . <EOS>
<SOS> i take it much unkindly that thou , propn , who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this . <EOS>
<SOS> sblood , but you ’ ll not hear me ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou told ’ st me thou didst hold him in thy hate . <EOS>
<SOS> despise me if i do not . <EOS>
<SOS> i look down towards his feet , but that ’ s a fable . <EOS>
<SOS> if that thou be ’ st a devil , i can not kill thee . <EOS>
<SOS> wrench his sword from him . <EOS>
<SOS> i bleed , sir , but not killed . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not sorry neither . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ d have thee live , for in my sense ’ tis happiness to die . <EOS>
<SOS> why , anything . <EOS>
<SOS> this wretch hath part confessed his villainy . <EOS>
<SOS> did you and he consent in propn ’ s death ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay . <EOS>
<SOS> dear general , i never gave you cause . <EOS>
<SOS> i do believe it , and i ask your pardon . <EOS>
<SOS> will you , i pray , demand that demi - devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ? <EOS>
<SOS> demand me nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> what you know , you know . <EOS>
<SOS> from this time forth i never will speak word . <EOS>
<SOS> what , not to pray ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , thou dost best . <EOS>
<SOS> the one of them imports the death of propn to be undertook by propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> most heathenish and most gross ! <EOS>
<SOS> o thou pernicious caitiff ! <EOS>
<SOS> how came you , propn , by that handkerchief that was my wife ’ s ? <EOS>
<SOS> i found it in my chamber , and he himself confessed but even now that there he dropped it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire . <EOS>
<SOS> your power and your command is taken off and propn rules in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> for this slave , if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long , it shall be his . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state .— come , bring him away . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice . <EOS>
<SOS> then must you speak of one that loved not wisely , but too well . <EOS>
<SOS> of one not easily jealous , but being wrought , perplexed in the extreme . <EOS>
<SOS> of one whose hand , like the base propn , threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe . <EOS>
<SOS> set you down this , <EOS>
<SOS> and say besides that in propn once , where a malignant and a turbaned propn beat a propn and traduced the state , i took by the throat the circumcisèd dog , and smote him , thus . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , bloody period ! <EOS>
<SOS> all that is spoke is marred . <EOS>
<SOS> this did i fear , but thought he had no weapon , for he was great of heart . <EOS>
<SOS> how say you by this change ? <EOS>
<SOS> this can not be , by no assay of reason . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a pageant , to keep us in false gaze . <EOS>
<SOS> here is more news . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , so i thought . <EOS>
<SOS> how many , as you guess ? <EOS>
<SOS> of thirty sail . <EOS>
<SOS> and now they do re - stem their backward course , bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , your trusty and most valiant servitor , with his free duty recommends you thus , and prays you to believe him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn certain then for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , is not he in town ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s now in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> write from us to him . <EOS>
<SOS> post - post - haste , dispatch . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes propn and the valiant propn . <EOS>
<SOS> good your grace , pardon me . <EOS>
<SOS> why , what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> my daughter ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my daughter ! <EOS>
<SOS> dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , to me . <EOS>
<SOS> whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding propn thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her , the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter , after your own sense , yea , though our proper son propn in your action . <EOS>
<SOS> humbly i thank your grace . <EOS>
<SOS> we are very sorry for ’ t . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , but this is so . <EOS>
<SOS> the very head and front of my offending propn this extent , no more . <EOS>
<SOS> more than pertains to feats of broils and battle , and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself . <EOS>
<SOS> a maiden never bold , of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself . <EOS>
<SOS> against all rules of nature , and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be . <EOS>
<SOS> i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood or with some dram , conjured to this effect , he wrought upon her . <EOS>
<SOS> but , propn , speak . <EOS>
<SOS> or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth ? <EOS>
<SOS> and let her speak of me before her father . <EOS>
<SOS> fetch propn hither . <EOS>
<SOS> you best know the place . <EOS>
<SOS> and till she come , as truly as to propn i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i ’ ll present how i did thrive in this fair lady ’ s love and she in mine . <EOS>
<SOS> say it , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> her father loved me , oft invited me , still questioned me the story of my life from year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , that i have passed . <EOS>
<SOS> these things to hear would propn seriously incline . <EOS>
<SOS> she wished she had not heard it , yet she wished that propn had made her such a man . <EOS>
<SOS> she thanked me and bade me , if i had a friend that loved her , i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her . <EOS>
<SOS> upon this hint i spake . <EOS>
<SOS> she loved me for the dangers i had passed , and i loved her that she did pity them . <EOS>
<SOS> this only is the witchcraft i have used . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes the lady . <EOS>
<SOS> let her witness it . <EOS>
<SOS> i think this tale would win my daughter too . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , hear her speak . <EOS>
<SOS> if she confess that she was half the wooer , destruction on my head if my bad blame propn on the man .— come hither , gentle mistress . <EOS>
<SOS> do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience ? <EOS>
<SOS> my noble father , i do perceive here a divided duty . <EOS>
<SOS> to you i am bound for life and education . <EOS>
<SOS> you are the lord of duty . <EOS>
<SOS> i am hitherto your daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> i have done . <EOS>
<SOS> please it your grace , on to the state affairs . <EOS>
<SOS> i had rather to adopt a child than get it.— come hither , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i here do give thee that with all my heart which , but thou hast already , with all my heart i would keep from thee . <EOS>
<SOS> for thy escape would teach me tyranny , to hang clogs on them .— i have done , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which , as a grise or step , may help these lovers . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly beseech you , proceed to th ' affairs of state . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn with a most mighty preparation makes for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> why , at her father propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll not have it so . <EOS>
<SOS> nor i . <EOS>
<SOS> most gracious propn , to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice , propn ' assist my simpleness . <EOS>
<SOS> what would you , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> that i did love the propn to live with him , my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world . <EOS>
<SOS> i saw propn ’ s visage in his mind , and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate . <EOS>
<SOS> let me go with him . <EOS>
<SOS> let her have your voice . <EOS>
<SOS> be it as you shall privately determine , either for her stay or going . <EOS>
<SOS> th ' affair cries haste and speed must answer it . <EOS>
<SOS> you must away tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> with all my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> at nine i ' th ' morning here we ’ ll meet again . <EOS>
<SOS> othello , leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you , and such things else of quality and respect as doth import you . <EOS>
<SOS> to his conveyance i assign my wife , with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me . <EOS>
<SOS> wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he . <EOS>
<SOS> mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership . <EOS>
<SOS> why , there ’ s no remedy . <EOS>
<SOS> propn the curse of service . <EOS>
<SOS> now sir , be judge yourself , whether i in any just term am affined to love the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i would not follow him then . <EOS>
<SOS> o sir , content you . <EOS>
<SOS> i follow him to serve my turn upon him . <EOS>
<SOS> we can not all be masters , nor all masters can not be truly followed . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall mark many a duteous and knee - crooking knave that ( doting on his own obsequious bondage ) wears out his time much like his master ’ s ass for naught but provender , and when he ’ s old , cashiered . <EOS>
<SOS> whip me such honest knaves . <EOS>
<SOS> these fellows have some soul , <EOS>
<SOS> let it be so . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn well . <EOS>
<SOS> look to her , propn , if thou hast eyes to see . <EOS>
<SOS> she has deceived her father , and may thee . <EOS>
<SOS> my life upon her faith ! —honest propn , my propn must i leave to thee . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , let thy wife attend on her , and bring them after in the best advantage . <EOS>
<SOS> come , propn , i have but an hour of love , of worldly matter and direction , to spend with thee . <EOS>
<SOS> we must obey the time . <EOS>
<SOS> iago . <EOS>
<SOS> what propn thou , noble heart ? <EOS>
<SOS> what will i do , think ’ st thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , go to bed , and sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> i will incontinently drown myself . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou dost i shall never love thee after . <EOS>
<SOS> why , thou silly gentleman ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , villainous ! <EOS>
<SOS> i have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself . <EOS>
<SOS> propn i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , i would change my humanity with a baboon . <EOS>
<SOS> what should i do ? <EOS>
<SOS> i confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it . <EOS>
<SOS> virtue ? <EOS>
<SOS> a fig ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn in ourselves that we are thus or thus . <EOS>
<SOS> our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners . <EOS>
<SOS> so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many — either to have it sterile with idleness , or manured with industry — why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills . <EOS>
<SOS> if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions . <EOS>
<SOS> but we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts . <EOS>
<SOS> it can not be . <EOS>
<SOS> it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will . <EOS>
<SOS> come , be a man . <EOS>
<SOS> drown thyself ? <EOS>
<SOS> drown cats and blind puppies ! <EOS>
<SOS> i have professed me thy friend , and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness . <EOS>
<SOS> i could never better stead thee than now . <EOS>
<SOS> put money in thy purse . <EOS>
<SOS> these moors are changeable in their wills — fill thy purse with money . <EOS>
<SOS> the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida . <EOS>
<SOS> she must change for youth . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore , put money in thy purse . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning . <EOS>
<SOS> make all the money thou canst . <EOS>
<SOS> if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle propn be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her . <EOS>
<SOS> a pox of drowning thyself ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn clean out of the way . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art sure of me . <EOS>
<SOS> go , make money . <EOS>
<SOS> i have told thee often , and i re - tell thee again and again , i hate the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , go , provide thy money . <EOS>
<SOS> we will have more of this tomorrow . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> where shall we meet i ' th ' morning ? <EOS>
<SOS> at my lodging . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be with thee betimes . <EOS>
<SOS> no more of drowning , do you hear ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am changed . <EOS>
<SOS> go to , farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> put money enough in your purse . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll sell all my land . <EOS>
<SOS> thus do i ever make my fool my purse . <EOS>
<SOS> for i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit . <EOS>
<SOS> i hate the propn , and it is thought abroad that ’ twixt my sheets he ’ s done my office . <EOS>
<SOS> i know not if propn be true , but i , for mere suspicion in that kind , will do as if for surety . <EOS>
<SOS> he holds me well . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn a proper man . <EOS>
<SOS> let me see now , <EOS>
<SOS> to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery . <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s see . <EOS>
<SOS> i have propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what from the cape can you discern at sea ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing at all . <EOS>
<SOS> it is a high - wrought flood . <EOS>
<SOS> methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements . <EOS>
<SOS> what shall we hear of this ? <EOS>
<SOS> a segregation of the turkish fleet . <EOS>
<SOS> for do but stand upon the foaming shore , the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , the wind - shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , seems to cast water on the burning bear , and quench the guards of th ' ever - fixèd pole . <EOS>
<SOS> i never did like molestation view on the enchafèd flood . <EOS>
<SOS> if that the turkish fleet be not ensheltered and embayed , they are drowned . <EOS>
<SOS> it is impossible they bear it out . <EOS>
<SOS> news , lads , our wars are done ! <EOS>
<SOS> the desperate tempest hath so banged the propn , that their designment halts . <EOS>
<SOS> a noble ship of propn propn seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet . <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> is this true ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , propn to the warlike propn propn , is come on shore . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn himself at sea and is in full commission here for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i am glad on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a worthy governor . <EOS>
<SOS> for they were parted with foul and violent tempest . <EOS>
<SOS> pray heavens he be , for i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier . <EOS>
<SOS> come , let ’ s do so . <EOS>
<SOS> for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance . <EOS>
<SOS> thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , let the heavens give him defense against the elements , for i have lost him on a dangerous sea . <EOS>
<SOS> is he well shipped ? <EOS>
<SOS> his bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , stand in bold cure . <EOS>
<SOS> what noise ? <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you sir , go forth and give us truth who propn that is arrived . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall . <EOS>
<SOS> but good lieutenant , is your general wived ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn one propn , ancient to the general . <EOS>
<SOS> what is she ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , behold , the riches of the ship is come on shore ! <EOS>
<SOS> you men of propn , let her have your knees . <EOS>
<SOS> hail to thee , lady , and the grace of propn , before , behind thee , and on every hand , propn thee round ! <EOS>
<SOS> i thank you , valiant propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what tidings can you tell me of my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> he is not yet arrived . <EOS>
<SOS> nor know i aught but that he ’ s well and will be shortly here . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , but i fear . <EOS>
<SOS> how lost you company ? <EOS>
<SOS> the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship— but , hark ! <EOS>
<SOS> see for the news . <EOS>
<SOS> for , sir , it is as sure as you are propn , were i the propn , i would not be propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not what i am . <EOS>
<SOS> do , with like timorous accent and dire yell as when , by night and negligence , the fire is spied in populous cities . <EOS>
<SOS> what , ho , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> look to your house , your daughter , and your bags ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> thieves ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me , you ’ ll have enough . <EOS>
<SOS> i find it still , when i have leave to sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> marry , before your ladyship , i grant , she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking . <EOS>
<SOS> you have little cause to say so . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , come on . <EOS>
<SOS> you are pictures out of door , bells in your parlors , wild - cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , fie upon thee , slanderer ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , it is true , or else i am a propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you rise to play and go to bed to work . <EOS>
<SOS> no , let me not . <EOS>
<SOS> what wouldst thou write of me , if thou should ’ st praise me ? <EOS>
<SOS> o gentle lady , do not put me to propn , for i am nothing , if not critical . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , assay . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not merry , but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise . <EOS>
<SOS> come , how wouldst thou praise me ? <EOS>
<SOS> well praised ! <EOS>
<SOS> if she be black , and thereto have a wit , she ’ ll find a white that shall her blackness fit . <EOS>
<SOS> worse and worse ! <EOS>
<SOS> how if fair and foolish ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , heavy ignorance ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou praisest the worst best . <EOS>
<SOS> but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ? <EOS>
<SOS> she that was ever fair and never proud , had tongue at will and yet was never loud , never lacked gold and yet went never gay , fled from her wish and yet said “ now i may , ” she that being angered , her revenge being nigh , propn her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod ’ s head for the salmon ’ s tail , she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind , see suitors following and not look behind , she was a wight , if ever such wights were— to do what ? <EOS>
<SOS> to suckle fools and chronicle small beer . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , most lame and impotent conclusion ! <EOS>
<SOS> do not learn of him , propn , though he be thy husband . <EOS>
<SOS> how say you , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> is he not a most profane and liberal counselor ? <EOS>
<SOS> he speaks home , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar . <EOS>
<SOS> i know his trumpet . <EOS>
<SOS> propn truly so . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s meet him and receive him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , where he comes ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh my fair warrior ! <EOS>
<SOS> my dear othello ! <EOS>
<SOS> it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my soul ’ s joy ! <EOS>
<SOS> if it were now to die , ' twere now to be most happy , for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this propn in unknown fate . <EOS>
<SOS> the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase , even as our days do grow . <EOS>
<SOS> amen to that , sweet powers ! <EOS>
<SOS> i can not speak enough of this content . <EOS>
<SOS> it stops me here , it is too much of joy . <EOS>
<SOS> come , let us to the castle . <EOS>
<SOS> news , friends ! <EOS>
<SOS> our wars are done , the propn are drowned . <EOS>
<SOS> how does my old acquaintance of this propn propn , you shall be well desired in propn , i have found great love amongst them . <EOS>
<SOS> bring thou the master to the citadel . <EOS>
<SOS> he is a good one , and his worthiness does challenge much respect .— come , propn , once more , well met at propn . <EOS>
<SOS> do thou meet me presently at the harbor .— come hither . <EOS>
<SOS> the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard . <EOS>
<SOS> first , i must tell thee this : propn is directly in love with him . <EOS>
<SOS> with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , ’ tis not possible . <EOS>
<SOS> lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed . <EOS>
<SOS> all which the propn is defective in . <EOS>
<SOS> now sir , this granted — as it is a most pregnant and unforced position — who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as propn does ? <EOS>
<SOS> besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not believe that in her . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s full of most blessed condition . <EOS>
<SOS> the wine she drinks is made of grapes . <EOS>
<SOS> if she had been blessed , she would never have loved the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> blessed pudding ! <EOS>
<SOS> didst not mark that ? <EOS>
<SOS> they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together . <EOS>
<SOS> pish ! <EOS>
<SOS> but , sir , be you ruled by me . <EOS>
<SOS> i have brought you from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> watch you tonight for the command , i ’ ll lay propn upon you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn knows you not . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll not be far from you . <EOS>
<SOS> do you find some occasion to anger propn , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister . <EOS>
<SOS> well . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , he ’ s rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you . <EOS>
<SOS> provoke him that he may . <EOS>
<SOS> for even out of that will i cause these of propn to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity . <EOS>
<SOS> i warrant thee . <EOS>
<SOS> meet me by and by at the citadel . <EOS>
<SOS> i must fetch his necessaries ashore . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the thought whereof propn , like a poisonous mineral , gnaw my inwards , and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him , wife for wife . <EOS>
<SOS> or , failing so , yet that i put the propn at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment can not cure . <EOS>
<SOS> for besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial . <EOS>
<SOS> so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed . <EOS>
<SOS> all offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven . <EOS>
<SOS> bless the isle of propn and our noble general othello ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn is most honest . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , good night . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow with your earliest let me have speech with propn come , my dear love , the purchase made , the fruits are to ensue : that profit ’ s yet to come ’ tween me and you . <EOS>
<SOS> good night . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> we must to the watch . <EOS>
<SOS> our general cast us thus early for the love of his propn — who let us not therefore blame . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the reason of this terrible summons ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter there ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , is all your family within ? <EOS>
<SOS> are your doors locked ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , wherefore ask you this ? <EOS>
<SOS> zounds , sir , you ’ re robbed ! <EOS>
<SOS> for shame , put on your gown . <EOS>
<SOS> your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul . <EOS>
<SOS> even now , now , very now , an old black ram is tupping your white ewe . <EOS>
<SOS> arise , arise , propn the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you . <EOS>
<SOS> arise , i say ! <EOS>
<SOS> what , have you lost your wits ? <EOS>
<SOS> most reverend signior , do you know my voice ? <EOS>
<SOS> not i . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> my name is propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors . <EOS>
<SOS> in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , sir— <EOS>
<SOS> indeed she ’ s a most fresh and delicate creature . <EOS>
<SOS> what an eye she has ! <EOS>
<SOS> an inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest . <EOS>
<SOS> and when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ? <EOS>
<SOS> she is indeed perfection . <EOS>
<SOS> well , happiness to their sheets ! <EOS>
<SOS> not tonight , good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking . <EOS>
<SOS> i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , they are our friends . <EOS>
<SOS> but one cup . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll drink for you . <EOS>
<SOS> i have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily qualified too , and behold what innovation it makes here . <EOS>
<SOS> what , man , ’ tis a night of revels ! <EOS>
<SOS> the gallants desire it . <EOS>
<SOS> where are they ? <EOS>
<SOS> here at the door . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you call them in . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do propn , but it dislikes me . <EOS>
<SOS> if i can fasten but one cup upon him , with that which he hath drunk tonight already , he ’ ll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress ' dog . <EOS>
<SOS> now ’ mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our propn in some action that may offend the isle . <EOS>
<SOS> but here they come . <EOS>
<SOS> if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely , both with wind and stream . <EOS>
<SOS> fore propn , they have given me a rouse already . <EOS>
<SOS> good faith , a little one , not past a pint , as i am a soldier . <EOS>
<SOS> some wine , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> fore propn , an excellent song . <EOS>
<SOS> i learned it in propn where indeed they are most potent in potting . <EOS>
<SOS> your propn , your german , and your swag - bellied propn — propn , ho ! —are nothing to your propn . <EOS>
<SOS> is your propn so expert in his drinking ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your propn . <EOS>
<SOS> to the health of our general ! <EOS>
<SOS> i am for it , lieutenant , and i ’ ll do you justice . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , sweet propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , this is a more exquisite song than the other . <EOS>
<SOS> will you hear propn again ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things . <EOS>
<SOS> well , propn propn above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s true , good lieutenant . <EOS>
<SOS> for mine own part , no offence to the general nor any man of quality , i hope to be saved . <EOS>
<SOS> and so do i too , lieutenant . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , but ( by your leave ) not before me . <EOS>
<SOS> the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s have no more of this , let ’ s to our affairs .— forgive us our sins ! —gentlemen , let ’ s look to our business . <EOS>
<SOS> do not think , gentlemen , i am drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not drunk now . <EOS>
<SOS> i can stand well enough , and i speak well enough . <EOS>
<SOS> excellent well ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , very well then . <EOS>
<SOS> you must not think then that i am drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> propn pity of him . <EOS>
<SOS> but is he often thus ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn evermore the prologue to his sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ ll watch the propn a double set if drink rock not his cradle . <EOS>
<SOS> it were well the general were put in mind of it . <EOS>
<SOS> is not this true ? <EOS>
<SOS> and ’ tis great pity that the noble propn should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity . <EOS>
<SOS> it were an honest action to say so to the propn . <EOS>
