<SOS> i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak ’ st . <EOS>
<SOS> yet if thou say propn lives , is well , or friends with propn , or not captive to him , i ’ ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail propn pearls upon thee . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , he ’ s well . <EOS>
<SOS> well said . <EOS>
<SOS> and friends with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> th ’ art an honest man . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and he are greater friends than ever . <EOS>
<SOS> make thee a fortune from me . <EOS>
<SOS> but yet , madam— i do not like “ but yet . ” it does allay the good precedence . <EOS>
<SOS> propn upon “ but yet . ” “ but yet ” is as a jailer to bring forth some monstrous malefactor . <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , friend , pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , the good and bad together . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s friends with propn , in state of health , thou propn , and , thou say ’ st , free . <EOS>
<SOS> free , madam , no . <EOS>
<SOS> i made no such report . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s bound unto propn . <EOS>
<SOS> for what good turn ? <EOS>
<SOS> for the best turn i ’ th ’ bed . <EOS>
<SOS> i am pale , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , he ’ s married to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the most infectious pestilence upon thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> good madam , patience . <EOS>
<SOS> what say you ? <EOS>
<SOS> hence , horrible villain , or i ’ ll spurn thine eyes like balls before me ! <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll unhair thy head ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , smarting in ling ’ ring pickle ! <EOS>
<SOS> say propn not so , a province i will give thee and make thy fortunes proud . <EOS>
<SOS> the blow thou hadst shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , and i will boot thee with what gift beside propn modesty can beg . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s married , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , thou hast lived too long . <EOS>
<SOS> nay then , i ’ ll run . <EOS>
<SOS> what mean you , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have made no fault . <EOS>
<SOS> good madam , keep yourself within yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> the man is innocent . <EOS>
<SOS> some innocents ’ scape not the thunderbolt . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn into propn , and kindly creatures turn all to serpents . <EOS>
<SOS> call the slave again . <EOS>
<SOS> though i am mad , i will not bite him . <EOS>
<SOS> call ! <EOS>
<SOS> he is afeard to come . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not hurt him . <EOS>
<SOS> these hands do lack nobility that they strike a meaner than myself , since i myself have given myself the cause . <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> though it be honest , it is never good to bring bad news . <EOS>
<SOS> give to a gracious message an host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt . <EOS>
<SOS> i have done my duty . <EOS>
<SOS> is he married ? <EOS>
<SOS> the gods confound thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou hold there still ? <EOS>
<SOS> should i lie , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> go , get thee hence . <EOS>
<SOS> i crave your highness ’ pardon . <EOS>
<SOS> he is married ? <EOS>
<SOS> take no offense that i would not offend you . <EOS>
<SOS> to punish me for what you make me do seems much unequal . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s married to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , that his fault should make a knave of thee , that art not what th ’ art sure of ! <EOS>
<SOS> get thee hence . <EOS>
<SOS> the merchandise which thou hast brought from propn are all too dear for me . <EOS>
<SOS> lie they upon thy hand and be undone by ’ em ! <EOS>
<SOS> good your highness , patience . <EOS>
<SOS> in praising propn , i have dispraised propn . <EOS>
<SOS> many times , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i am paid for propn now . <EOS>
<SOS> lead me from hence . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn no matter.— go to the fellow , good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> bid him propn the feature of propn : her years , her inclination . <EOS>
<SOS> let him not leave out the color of her hair . <EOS>
<SOS> bring me word how tall she is . <EOS>
<SOS> lead me to my chamber . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , sweet propn , most anything propn , almost most absolute propn , where ’ s the soothsayer that you praised so to propn propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh that i knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands ! <EOS>
<SOS> i make not , but foresee . <EOS>
<SOS> pray , then , foresee me one . <EOS>
<SOS> no , you shall paint when you are old . <EOS>
<SOS> wrinkles forbid ! <EOS>
<SOS> vex not his prescience . <EOS>
<SOS> be attentive . <EOS>
<SOS> hush ! <EOS>
<SOS> you shall be more beloving than beloved . <EOS>
<SOS> most meet that first we come to words , and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent , which , if thou hast considered , let us know if ’ twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to propn much tall youth that else must perish here . <EOS>
<SOS> what was propn that moved pale propn to conspire ? <EOS>
<SOS> take your time . <EOS>
<SOS> thou canst not fear us , propn , with thy sails . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll speak with thee at sea . <EOS>
<SOS> at land , thou know ’ st how much we do o ’ ercount thee . <EOS>
<SOS> at land indeed thou dost o ’ ercount me of my father ’ s house , but since the cuckoo builds not for himself , propn in propn as thou mayst . <EOS>
<SOS> be pleased to tell us— for this is from the present — how you take the offers we have sent you . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s the point . <EOS>
<SOS> which do not be entreated to , but weigh what it is worth embraced . <EOS>
<SOS> you have made me offer of propn , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> and i must rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send measures of wheat to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> this ’ greed upon to part with unhacked edges and bear back our targes undinted . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s our offer . <EOS>
<SOS> know then i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer , but propn propn put me to some impatience . <EOS>
<SOS> let me have your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> i did not think , sir , to have met you here . <EOS>
<SOS> the beds i ’ propn propn are soft , and thanks to you , that called me timelier than my purpose hither , for i have gained by propn . <EOS>
<SOS> well , i know not what counts harsh propn casts upon my face , but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal . <EOS>
<SOS> well met here . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope so , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> thus we are agreed . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s the next to do . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll feast each other ere we part , and let ’ s propn lots who shall begin . <EOS>
<SOS> that will i , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> no , propn , take the lot . <EOS>
<SOS> but , first or last , your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame . <EOS>
<SOS> i have heard that propn propn grew fat with feasting there . <EOS>
<SOS> you have heard much . <EOS>
<SOS> i have fair meanings , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> and fair words to them . <EOS>
<SOS> then so much have i heard . <EOS>
<SOS> and i have heard propn carried— what , i pray you ? <EOS>
<SOS> how propn thou , soldier ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , and well am like to do , for i perceive , four feasts are toward . <EOS>
<SOS> let me shake thy hand . <EOS>
<SOS> i never hated thee . <EOS>
<SOS> i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behavior . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i never loved you much , but i propn praised ye when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did . <EOS>
<SOS> enjoy thy plainness . <EOS>
<SOS> it nothing ill becomes thee.— aboard my galley i invite you all . <EOS>
<SOS> will you lead , lords ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn the way , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> come . <EOS>
<SOS> at sea , i think . <EOS>
<SOS> we have , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> you have done well by water . <EOS>
<SOS> and you by land . <EOS>
<SOS> i will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what i have done by land . <EOS>
<SOS> nor what i have done by water . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea . <EOS>
<SOS> and you by land . <EOS>
<SOS> there i deny my land service . <EOS>
<SOS> but give me your hand , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing . <EOS>
<SOS> all men ’ s faces are true , whatsome ’ er their hands are . <EOS>
<SOS> but there is never a fair woman has a true face . <EOS>
<SOS> no slander . <EOS>
<SOS> they steal hearts . <EOS>
<SOS> we came hither to fight with you . <EOS>
<SOS> for my part , i am sorry it is turned to a drinking . <EOS>
<SOS> pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune . <EOS>
<SOS> if he do , sure he can not weep propn back again . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve said , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> we looked not for propn propn here . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , is he married to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s sister is called propn . <EOS>
<SOS> true , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> she was the wife of propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but she is now the wife of propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> pray propn , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn true . <EOS>
<SOS> then is propn and he forever knit together . <EOS>
<SOS> if i were bound to divine of this unity , i would not prophesy so . <EOS>
<SOS> i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties . <EOS>
<SOS> i think so too . <EOS>
<SOS> but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is of a holy , cold , and still conversation . <EOS>
<SOS> who would not have his wife so ? <EOS>
<SOS> not he that himself is not so , which is propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he will to his egyptian dish again . <EOS>
<SOS> then shall the sighs of propn blow the fire up in propn , and , as i said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance . <EOS>
<SOS> propn will use his affection where it is . <EOS>
<SOS> he married but his occasion here . <EOS>
<SOS> and thus it may be . <EOS>
<SOS> come , sir , will you aboard ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have a health for you . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall take it , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> we have used our throats in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> come , let ’ s away . <EOS>
<SOS> here they ’ ll be , man . <EOS>
<SOS> some o ’ their plants are ill - rooted already . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is high - colored . <EOS>
<SOS> they have made him drink alms - drink . <EOS>
<SOS> i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave . <EOS>
<SOS> thus do they , sir : they take the flow propn propn propn by certain scales i ’ propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> they know by propn height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth or foison follow . <EOS>
<SOS> the higher propn swells the more it promises . <EOS>
<SOS> as it ebbs , the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , and shortly comes to harvest . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ve strange serpents there ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> your serpent of propn is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not so well as i should be , but i ’ ll ne ’ er out . <EOS>
<SOS> not till you have slept . <EOS>
<SOS> i fear me you ’ ll be in till then . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , certainly , i have heard the ptolemies ’ pyramises are very goodly things . <EOS>
<SOS> without contradiction i have heard that . <EOS>
<SOS> what manner o ’ thing is your crocodile ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth . <EOS>
<SOS> it is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs . <EOS>
<SOS> of it own color too . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a strange serpent . <EOS>
<SOS> propn so . <EOS>
<SOS> and the tears of it are wet . <EOS>
<SOS> the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes . <EOS>
<SOS> thou hast served me with much faith . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s else to say ? — these quicksands , propn , keep off them , for you sink . <EOS>
<SOS> what sayst thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> wilt thou be lord of the whole world ? <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s twice . <EOS>
<SOS> how should that be ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , hear him . <EOS>
<SOS> good now , some excellent fortune ! <EOS>
<SOS> let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , excellent ! <EOS>
<SOS> then belike my children shall have no names . <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , how many boys and wenches must i have ? <EOS>
<SOS> if every of your wishes had a womb , and fertile every wish , a million . <EOS>
<SOS> you think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll know all our fortunes . <EOS>
<SOS> mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be — drunk to bed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou drunk well ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , propn , i have kept me from the cup . <EOS>
<SOS> show me which way . <EOS>
<SOS> these three world - sharers , these competitors , are in thy vessel . <EOS>
<SOS> all there is thine . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , this thou shouldst have done and not have spoke on propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> in me ’ tis villainy , in thee propn had been good service . <EOS>
<SOS> propn must know , ’ tis not my profit that does lead mine honor ; mine honor , it . <EOS>
<SOS> repent that e ’ er thy tongue propn so betrayed thine act . <EOS>
<SOS> being done unknown , i should have found it afterwards well done , but must condemn it now . <EOS>
<SOS> desist , and drink . <EOS>
<SOS> this health to propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s to thee , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> enobarbus , welcome . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a strong fellow , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> he bears the third part of the world , man . <EOS>
<SOS> seest not ? <EOS>
<SOS> the third part , then , is drunk . <EOS>
<SOS> drink thou . <EOS>
<SOS> come . <EOS>
<SOS> this is not yet an alexandrian feast . <EOS>
<SOS> it ripens towards it . <EOS>
<SOS> strike the vessels , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i could well forbear propn . <EOS>
<SOS> be a child propn th ’ time . <EOS>
<SOS> but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s ha propn , good soldier . <EOS>
<SOS> come , let ’ s all take hands propn that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate propn . <EOS>
<SOS> all take hands . <EOS>
<SOS> what needs more words ? <EOS>
<SOS> good night . <EOS>
<SOS> and shall , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> give ’ s your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> we are friends . <EOS>
<SOS> come , down into the boat . <EOS>
<SOS> take heed you fall not . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i ’ ll not on shore . <EOS>
<SOS> no , to my cabin . <EOS>
<SOS> what ! <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s my cap . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> noble captain , come . <EOS>
<SOS> now , darting propn , art thou struck , and now pleased fortune does of propn propn death make me revenger . <EOS>
<SOS> for learn this , propn : better to leave undone than by our deed propn too high a fame when him we serve ’ s away . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and propn have ever won more in their officer than person . <EOS>
<SOS> who does i ’ th ’ wars more than his captain can becomes his captain ’ s captain ; and ambition , the soldier ’ s virtue , rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him . <EOS>
<SOS> i could do more to do antonius good , but propn offend him , and in his offense should my performance perish . <EOS>
<SOS> thou hast , propn , that without the which a soldier and his sword propn scarce distinction . <EOS>
<SOS> thou wilt write to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll humbly signify what in his name , that magical word of war , we have effected : how with his banners and his well - paid ranks the propn - yet - beaten horse of propn we have jaded out propn th ’ field . <EOS>
<SOS> where is he now ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , are the brothers parted ? <EOS>
<SOS> they have dispatched with propn ; he is gone . <EOS>
<SOS> octavia weeps to part from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is sad , and propn , since propn ’ s feast , as propn says , is troubled with the greensickness . <EOS>
<SOS> a very fine one . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , how he loves propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , but how dearly he adores propn propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> the god of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> spake you of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> how , the nonpareil ! <EOS>
<SOS> o antony , o thou arabian bird ! <EOS>
<SOS> would you praise propn , say “ propn . ” go no further . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises . <EOS>
<SOS> but he loves propn best ; yet he loves propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not think , speak , cast , write , sing , number — hoo ! — his love to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> both he loves . <EOS>
<SOS> they are his shards , and he <EOS>
<SOS> so , this is to horse . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , noble propn . <EOS>
<SOS> good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> no further , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> for better might we have loved without this mean , if on both parts this be not cherished . <EOS>
<SOS> make me not offended in your distrust . <EOS>
<SOS> i have said . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall not find , though you be therein curious , the least cause for what you seem to fear . <EOS>
<SOS> so the gods keep you and make the hearts of propn serve your ends . <EOS>
<SOS> we will here part . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my dearest sister , fare thee well . <EOS>
<SOS> the elements be kind to thee and make propn spirits all of comfort ! <EOS>
<SOS> fare thee well . <EOS>
<SOS> my noble brother ! <EOS>
<SOS> the propn propn in her eyes ; it is love ’ s spring , and these the showers to bring it on . <EOS>
<SOS> what , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll tell you in your ear . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here i have you . <EOS>
<SOS> thus i let you go and give you to the gods . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> be happy . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> e ’ en as the o ’ erflowing propn presageth famine . <EOS>
<SOS> go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , i can not scratch mine ear .— prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune . <EOS>
<SOS> your fortunes are alike . <EOS>
<SOS> but how , but how ? <EOS>
<SOS> give me particulars . <EOS>
<SOS> i have said . <EOS>
<SOS> am i not an inch of fortune better than she ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than i , where would you choose it ? <EOS>
<SOS> not in my husband ’ s nose . <EOS>
<SOS> our worser thoughts heavens mend . <EOS>
<SOS> alexas ! <EOS>
<SOS> for , as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose - wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore , dear propn , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly . <EOS>
<SOS> where is the fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> half afeard to come . <EOS>
<SOS> go to , go to .— come hither , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> good majesty , propn of propn dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased . <EOS>
<SOS> that propn ’ s head i ’ ll have ! <EOS>
<SOS> most gracious majesty ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou behold propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , dread propn . <EOS>
<SOS> where ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i looked her in the face , and saw her led between her brother and propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> is she as tall as me ? <EOS>
<SOS> she is not , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> propn hear her speak ? <EOS>
<SOS> is she shrill - tongued or low ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i heard her speak . <EOS>
<SOS> she is low - voiced . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s not so good . <EOS>
<SOS> he can not like her long . <EOS>
<SOS> like her ? <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , ’ tis impossible . <EOS>
<SOS> i think so , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> she creeps . <EOS>
<SOS> she shows a body rather than a life , a statue than a breather . <EOS>
<SOS> is this certain ? <EOS>
<SOS> or i have no observance . <EOS>
<SOS> three in propn can not make better note . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s nothing in her yet . <EOS>
<SOS> the fellow has good judgment . <EOS>
<SOS> excellent . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , hark . <EOS>
<SOS> and i do think she ’ s thirty . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou her face in mind ? <EOS>
<SOS> is ’ t long or round ? <EOS>
<SOS> round , even to faultiness . <EOS>
<SOS> for the most part , too , they are foolish that are so . <EOS>
<SOS> her hair , what color ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , madam , and her forehead as low as she would wish it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn must not take my former sharpness ill . <EOS>
<SOS> i will employ thee back again ; i find thee most fit for business . <EOS>
<SOS> go make thee ready ; our letters are prepared . <EOS>
<SOS> a proper man . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed , he is so . <EOS>
<SOS> i repent me much that so i harried him . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> all may be well enough . <EOS>
<SOS> i warrant you , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> o my good lord , believe not all , or , if you must believe , propn not all . <EOS>
<SOS> a more unhappy lady , if this division chance , propn stood between , praying for both parts . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it . <EOS>
<SOS> the meantime , lady , i ’ ll raise the preparation of a war propn stain your brother . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn of power make me most weak , most weak , your reconciler ! <EOS>
<SOS> when it appears to you where this begins , turn your displeasure that way , for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them . <EOS>
<SOS> provide your going ; choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , friend propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s strange news come , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> what , man ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn and propn have made wars upon propn . <EOS>
<SOS> this is old . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the success ? <EOS>
<SOS> so the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine . <EOS>
<SOS> then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , and throw between them all the food thou hast , they ’ ll grind the one the other . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> more , propn : my lord desires you presently . <EOS>
<SOS> my news i might have told hereafter . <EOS>
<SOS> propn be naught , but let it be . <EOS>
<SOS> bring me to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> come , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> contemning propn , he has done all this and more in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s the manner of propn : propn th ’ marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , propn and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned . <EOS>
<SOS> this in the public eye ? <EOS>
<SOS> she in th ’ habiliments of the goddess propn that day appeared , and oft before gave audience , as ’ tis reported , so . <EOS>
<SOS> let propn be thus informed . <EOS>
<SOS> who , queasy with his insolence already , will their good thoughts call from him . <EOS>
<SOS> the people knows it , and have now received his accusations . <EOS>
<SOS> who does he accuse ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , and that , having in propn propn propn spoiled , we had not rated him his part propn th ’ isle . <EOS>
<SOS> then does he say he lent me some shipping , unrestored . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , this should be answered . <EOS>
<SOS> propn done already , and the messenger gone . <EOS>
<SOS> i have told him , propn was grown too cruel , that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ ll never yield to that . <EOS>
<SOS> nor must not then be yielded to in this . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn , and my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , most dear propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> that ever i should call thee castaway ! <EOS>
<SOS> you have not called me so , nor have you cause . <EOS>
<SOS> why have you stol ’ n upon us thus ? <EOS>
<SOS> you come not like propn ’ s sister . <EOS>
<SOS> the wife of propn should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach propn ere she did appear . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , the dust should have ascended to the roof of propn , raised by your populous troops . <EOS>
<SOS> we should have met you by sea and land , supplying every stage with an augmented greeting . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , propn propn , hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted my grievèd ear withal , whereon i begged his pardon for return . <EOS>
<SOS> which soon he granted , being an obstruct ’ tween his lust and him . <EOS>
<SOS> amen . <EOS>
<SOS> hush ! <EOS>
<SOS> here comes propn . <EOS>
<SOS> saw you my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , lady . <EOS>
<SOS> was he not here ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> he was disposed to mirth , but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him .— propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> here at your service . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord approaches . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thy wife first came into the field . <EOS>
<SOS> against my brother propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay . <EOS>
<SOS> do not say so , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> where is he now ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> no , my most wrongèd sister . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn nodded him to her . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath given his empire up to a whore ; who now are levying the kings propn th ’ earth for war . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath assembled propn , the propn of propn ; propn , of propn ; propn , propn of propn ; the thracian king , propn ; propn propn of propn ; propn of propn ; propn of propn ; propn , propn of propn ; propn and propn , the kings of propn and propn , with a more larger list of scepters . <EOS>
<SOS> ay me , most wretched , that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that does afflict each other ! <EOS>
<SOS> welcome hither . <EOS>
<SOS> your letters did withhold our breaking forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger . <EOS>
<SOS> cheer your heart . <EOS>
<SOS> best of comfort , and ever welcome to us . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , lady . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , dear madam . <EOS>
<SOS> each heart in propn does love and pity you . <EOS>
<SOS> only th ’ adulterous propn , most large in his abominations , turns you off and gives his potent regiment to a trull that noises it against us . <EOS>
<SOS> most certain . <EOS>
<SOS> sister , welcome . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you be ever known to patience . <EOS>
<SOS> my dear ’ st sister ! <EOS>
<SOS> but why , why , why ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou hast forspoke my being in these wars and sayst it is not fit . <EOS>
<SOS> is propn not denounced against us ? <EOS>
<SOS> why should not we be there in person ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is ’ t you say ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> and their tongues rot that speak against us ! <EOS>
<SOS> a charge we bear propn th ’ war , and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man . <EOS>
<SOS> speak not against it . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not stay behind . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , i have done . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> is it not strange , propn , that from propn and propn he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in propn ? — you have heard on propn , sweet ? <EOS>
<SOS> celerity is never more admired than by the negligent . <EOS>
<SOS> by sea , what else ? <EOS>
<SOS> why will my lord do so ? <EOS>
<SOS> for that he dares us to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> so hath my lord dared him to single fight . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , and to wage this battle at propn , where propn fought with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but these offers , which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , and so should you . <EOS>
<SOS> in propn ’ s fleet are those that often have propn propn fought . <EOS>
<SOS> their ships are yare , yours , heavy . <EOS>
<SOS> no disgrace propn fall you for refusing him at sea , being prepared for land . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll fight at sea . <EOS>
<SOS> but if we fail , we then can do propn at land . <EOS>
<SOS> thy business ? <EOS>
<SOS> the news is true , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> he is descried . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , and our twelve thousand horse . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , worthy soldier ? <EOS>
<SOS> o noble propn , do not fight by sea ! <EOS>
<SOS> trust not to rotten planks . <EOS>
<SOS> do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds ? <EOS>
<SOS> let propn propn and the propn go a - ducking . <EOS>
<SOS> we have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot . <EOS>
<SOS> well , well , away . <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , i think i am i ’ th ’ right . <EOS>
<SOS> soldier , thou art ; but his whole action grows not in the power on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> so our leader propn led , and we are women ’ s men . <EOS>
<SOS> you keep by land the legions and the horse whole , do you not ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , propn propn , propn , and propn , are for sea ; but we keep whole by land . <EOS>
<SOS> this speed of propn propn propn beyond belief . <EOS>
<SOS> while he was yet in propn his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s his lieutenant , hear you ? <EOS>
<SOS> they say , one propn . <EOS>
<SOS> well i know the man . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn calls propn . <EOS>
<SOS> with news the time propn with labor , and throws forth each minute some . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> strike not by land ; keep whole . <EOS>
<SOS> provoke not battle till we have done at sea . <EOS>
<SOS> our fortune lies upon this jump . <EOS>
<SOS> set we our squadrons on yond side propn propn hill , in eye of propn ’ s battle , from which place we may the number of the ships behold and so proceed accordingly . <EOS>
<SOS> i can behold no longer . <EOS>
<SOS> gods and goddesses , all the whole synod of them ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s thy passion ? <EOS>
<SOS> the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance . <EOS>
<SOS> we have kissed away kingdoms and provinces . <EOS>
<SOS> how appears the fight ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ribaudred nag of propn propn leprosy o ’ ertake ! —i ’ th ’ midst propn propn fight , when vantage like a pair of twins appeared both as the same , or rather ours the elder , the breeze upon her , like a cow in propn , propn sails and flies . <EOS>
<SOS> that i beheld . <EOS>
<SOS> mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view . <EOS>
<SOS> well , what worst ? <EOS>
<SOS> the nature of bad news infects the teller . <EOS>
<SOS> when it concerns the fool or coward . <EOS>
<SOS> on . <EOS>
<SOS> things that are past are done , with me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thus : who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , i hear him as he flattered . <EOS>
<SOS> o my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> speak to me home . <EOS>
<SOS> name propn as she is called in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , then we bring forth weeds when our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us is as our earing . <EOS>
<SOS> fare thee well awhile . <EOS>
<SOS> i never saw an action of such shame . <EOS>
<SOS> experience , manhood , honor , propn before did violate so itself . <EOS>
<SOS> alack , alack ! <EOS>
<SOS> our fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably . <EOS>
<SOS> had our general been what he knew himself , it had gone well . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own ! <EOS>
<SOS> ay , are you thereabouts ? <EOS>
<SOS> why then , good night indeed . <EOS>
<SOS> toward propn are they fled . <EOS>
<SOS> to propn will i render my legions and my horse . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> friends , come hither . <EOS>
<SOS> i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way forever . <EOS>
<SOS> i have a ship propn with gold . <EOS>
<SOS> fly and make your peace with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> fly ? <EOS>
<SOS> not we . <EOS>
<SOS> i have fled myself , and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders . <EOS>
<SOS> friends , begone . <EOS>
<SOS> i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i followed that i blush to look upon ! <EOS>
<SOS> my very hairs do mutiny , for the white propn the brown for rashness , and they them for fear and doting . <EOS>
<SOS> friends , begone . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , look not sad , nor make replies of loathness . <EOS>
<SOS> take the hint which my despair proclaims . <EOS>
<SOS> let that be left which leaves itself . <EOS>
<SOS> to the seaside straightway ! <EOS>
<SOS> i will possess you of that ship and treasure . <EOS>
<SOS> leave me , i pray , a little . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you now , nay , do so , for indeed i have lost command . <EOS>
<SOS> why , what else ? <EOS>
<SOS> let me sit down . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , fie , fie , fie ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , o good propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> the propn , my lord , the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> go to him , madam , speak to him . <EOS>
<SOS> he is unqualitied with very shame . <EOS>
<SOS> well then , sustain me . <EOS>
<SOS> most noble sir , arise . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn approaches . <EOS>
<SOS> her head propn declined , and death will seize her but your comfort makes the rescue . <EOS>
<SOS> i have offended reputation , a most unnoble swerving . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , whither hast thou led me , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> o my lord , my lord , forgive my fearful sails ! <EOS>
<SOS> i little thought you would have followed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , thou knew ’ st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th ’ strings , and thou shouldst tow me after . <EOS>
<SOS> o ’ er my spirit propn full supremacy thou knew ’ st , and that propn beck might from the bidding of the gods command me . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my pardon ! <EOS>
<SOS> now i must to the young man send humble treaties , dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness , who with half the bulk propn th ’ world played as i pleased , making and marring fortunes . <EOS>
<SOS> you did know how much you were my conqueror , and that my sword , made weak by my affection , would obey it on all cause . <EOS>
<SOS> fall not a tear , i say . <EOS>
<SOS> one of them rates all that is won and lost . <EOS>
<SOS> give me a kiss . <EOS>
<SOS> even this repays me.— we sent our schoolmaster . <EOS>
<SOS> let him appear that ’ s come from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> know you him ? <EOS>
<SOS> approach and speak . <EOS>
<SOS> such as i am , i come from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i was of late as petty to his ends as is the morn - dew on the myrtle leaf to his grand sea . <EOS>
<SOS> be propn so . <EOS>
<SOS> declare thine office . <EOS>
<SOS> propn of his fortunes he salutes thee , and requires to live in propn ; which not granted , he lessens his requests , and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth a private man in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> this for him . <EOS>
<SOS> next , propn does confess thy greatness , submits her to thy might , and of thee craves the circle of the propn for her heirs , now hazarded to thy grace . <EOS>
<SOS> for propn , i have no ears to his request . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn of audience nor desire shall fail , so she from propn drive her all - disgracèd friend or take his life there . <EOS>
<SOS> this if she perform , she shall not sue unheard . <EOS>
<SOS> so to them both . <EOS>
<SOS> fortune pursue thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> bring him through the bands . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i go . <EOS>
<SOS> observe how propn becomes his flaw , and what thou think ’ st his very action speaks in every power that moves . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i shall . <EOS>
<SOS> what shall we do , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> think and die . <EOS>
<SOS> is propn or we in fault for this ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn only , that would make his will propn of his reason . <EOS>
<SOS> why should he follow ? <EOS>
<SOS> the itch of his affection should not then have nicked his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed , he being the merèd question . <EOS>
<SOS> twas a shame no less than was his loss , to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing . <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , peace . <EOS>
<SOS> is that his answer ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn shall then have courtesy , so she will yield us up ? <EOS>
<SOS> he says so . <EOS>
<SOS> let her know ’ t.— and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities . <EOS>
<SOS> that head , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> a messenger from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what , no more ceremony ? <EOS>
<SOS> see , my women , against the blown rose may they stop their nose , that kneeled unto the buds .— admit him , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> at your noble pleasure . <EOS>
<SOS> he stays upon your will . <EOS>
<SOS> what are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> fulvia thy wife is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> where died she ? <EOS>
<SOS> in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> her length of sickness , with what else more serious propn thee to know , this bears . <EOS>
<SOS> forbear me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s will ? <EOS>
<SOS> hear it apart . <EOS>
<SOS> none but friends . <EOS>
<SOS> say boldly . <EOS>
<SOS> so haply are they friends to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he needs as many , sir , as propn has , or needs not us . <EOS>
<SOS> if propn please , our master will leap to be his friend . <EOS>
<SOS> for us , you know whose he is we are , and that is propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thus then , thou most renowned : propn entreats not to consider in what case thou stand ’ st , further than he is propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he knows that you embrace not propn as you did love , but as you feared him . <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> he is a god and knows what is most right . <EOS>
<SOS> mine honor was not yielded , but conquered merely . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i say to propn what you require of him ? <EOS>
<SOS> for he partly begs to be desired to give . <EOS>
<SOS> it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon . <EOS>
<SOS> but it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left propn and put yourself under his shroud , the universal landlord . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s your name ? <EOS>
<SOS> my name is propn . <EOS>
<SOS> most kind messenger , say to great propn this in deputation : i kiss his conqu ’ ring hand . <EOS>
<SOS> tell him i am prompt to lay my crown at ’ s feet , and there to kneel . <EOS>
<SOS> favors ? <EOS>
<SOS> by propn that thunders ! <EOS>
<SOS> what art thou , fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> you will be whipped . <EOS>
<SOS> take hence this jack and whip him . <EOS>
<SOS> moon and stars ! <EOS>
<SOS> whip him . <EOS>
<SOS> were propn twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge propn , should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here — what ’ s her name since she was propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> whip him , fellows , till like a boy , you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy . <EOS>
<SOS> take him hence . <EOS>
<SOS> this jack of propn ’ s shall bear us an errand to him . <EOS>
<SOS> good my lord— you have been a boggler ever . <EOS>
<SOS> but when we in our viciousness grow hard— oh , misery on ’ t ! —the wise gods seel our eyes , in our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us adore our errors , laugh at ’ s while we strut to our confusion . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , is propn come to this ? <EOS>
<SOS> i found you as a morsel cold upon propn propn ’ s trencher . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , you were a fragment of propn propn propn , besides what hotter hours , unregistered in vulgar fame , you have luxuriously picked out . <EOS>
<SOS> for i am sure , though you can guess what temperance should be , you know not what it is . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is this ? <EOS>
<SOS> soundly , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> cried he ? <EOS>
<SOS> and begged he pardon ? <EOS>
<SOS> he did ask favor . <EOS>
<SOS> have you done yet ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , and it portends alone the fall of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> to flatter propn , would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points ? <EOS>
<SOS> not know me yet ? <EOS>
<SOS> coldhearted toward me ? <EOS>
<SOS> ah , dear , if i be so , from my cold heart let propn engender hail , and poison it in the source , and the first stone propn in my neck . <EOS>
<SOS> as it determines , so dissolve my life ! <EOS>
<SOS> the next propn smite , till by degrees the memory of my womb , together with my brave propn all , by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of propn have buried them for prey ! <EOS>
<SOS> i am satisfied . <EOS>
<SOS> propn sits down in propn , where i will oppose his fate . <EOS>
<SOS> our force by land propn nobly held . <EOS>
<SOS> our severed navy too have knit again , and fleet , threat ’ ning most sealike . <EOS>
<SOS> where hast thou been , my heart ? <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou hear , lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips , i will appear in blood . <EOS>
<SOS> i and my sword will earn our chronicle . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s hope in propn yet . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s my brave lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> i will be treble - sinewed , -hearted , -breathed , and fight maliciously . <EOS>
<SOS> for when mine hours were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives of me for jests ; but now i ’ ll set my teeth and send to darkness all that stop me . <EOS>
<SOS> come , let ’ s have one other gaudy night . <EOS>
<SOS> call to me all my sad captains . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s mock the midnight bell . <EOS>
<SOS> it is my birthday . <EOS>
<SOS> i had thought t ’ have held it poor ; but since my lord is propn again , i will be propn . <EOS>
<SOS> we will yet do well . <EOS>
<SOS> do so . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll speak to them , and tonight i ’ ll force the wine peep through their scars .— come on , my propn , there ’ s sap in propn yet . <EOS>
<SOS> now he ’ ll outstare the lightning . <EOS>
<SOS> when valor preys on reason , it eats the sword it fights with . <EOS>
<SOS> i will seek some way to leave him . <EOS>
<SOS> he calls me “ boy ” and chides as he had power to beat me out of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die , meantime propn at his challenge . <EOS>
<SOS> give him no breath , but now make boot of his distraction . <EOS>
<SOS> never anger made good guard for itself . <EOS>
<SOS> let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight . <EOS>
<SOS> within our files there are , of those that served propn propn but late , enough to fetch him in . <EOS>
<SOS> see it done and feast the army . <EOS>
<SOS> we have store to do propn , and they have earned the waste . <EOS>
<SOS> poor propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s your pleasure , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> i must with haste from hence . <EOS>
<SOS> why , then , we kill all our women . <EOS>
<SOS> we see how mortal an unkindness is to them . <EOS>
<SOS> if they suffer our departure , death propn the word . <EOS>
<SOS> i must be gone . <EOS>
<SOS> under a compelling occasion , let women die . <EOS>
<SOS> it were pity to cast them away for nothing , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly . <EOS>
<SOS> i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment . <EOS>
<SOS> i do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying . <EOS>
<SOS> she is cunning past man propn thought . <EOS>
<SOS> we can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears . <EOS>
<SOS> he will not fight with me , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> why should he not ? <EOS>
<SOS> he thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , he is twenty men to one . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow , soldier , by sea and land i ’ ll fight . <EOS>
<SOS> or i will live or bathe my dying honor in the blood shall make it live again . <EOS>
<SOS> woo ’ t thou fight well ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll strike and cry , “ take all . ” well said . <EOS>
<SOS> come on ! <EOS>
<SOS> call forth my household servants . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s tonight be bounteous at our meal . <EOS>
<SOS> you have served me well , and kings have been your fellows . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods forbid ! <EOS>
<SOS> well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> scant not my cups , and make as much of me as when mine empire was your fellow too , and suffered my command . <EOS>
<SOS> look , they weep , and i , an ass , am onion - eyed . <EOS>
<SOS> ho , ho , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> now the witch take me if i meant it thus ! <EOS>
<SOS> grace grow where those drops fall ! <EOS>
<SOS> my hearty friends , you take me in too dolorous a sense , for i spake to you for your comfort , did desire you to burn this night with torches . <EOS>
<SOS> know , my hearts , i hope well of tomorrow , and will lead you where rather i ’ ll expect victorious life than death and honor . <EOS>
<SOS> brother , good night . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow is the day . <EOS>
<SOS> heard you of nothing strange about the streets ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> what news ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn but a rumor . <EOS>
<SOS> good night to you . <EOS>
<SOS> well , sir , good night . <EOS>
<SOS> soldiers , have careful watch . <EOS>
<SOS> and you . <EOS>
<SOS> here we . <EOS>
<SOS> and if tomorrow our navy thrive , i have an absolute hope our landmen will stand up . <EOS>

<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> music i ’ th ’ air . <EOS>

<SOS> it signs well , does it not ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> peace , i say ! <EOS>
<SOS> what should this mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> how now , masters ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay . <EOS>
<SOS> is propn not strange ? <EOS>
<SOS> do you hear , masters ? <EOS>
<SOS> do you hear ? <EOS>
<SOS> follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; let ’ s see how it will give off . <EOS>
<SOS> content . <EOS>
<SOS> propn strange . <EOS>
<SOS> sleep a little . <EOS>
<SOS> come , good fellow , put thine iron on . <EOS>
<SOS> if fortune be not ours today , it is because we brave her . <EOS>
<SOS> come . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , i ’ ll help too . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s this for ? <EOS>
<SOS> ah , let be , let be ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou art the armorer of my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> false , false . <EOS>
<SOS> this , this . <EOS>
<SOS> sooth , la , i ’ ll help . <EOS>
<SOS> thus it must be . <EOS>
<SOS> well , well , we shall thrive now .— seest thou , my good fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> go put on thy defenses . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> is not this buckled well ? <EOS>
<SOS> rarely , rarely . <EOS>
<SOS> dispatch .— o love , that thou couldst see my wars today , and knew ’ st the royal occupation ! <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow to thee . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome . <EOS>
<SOS> thou look ’ st like him that knows a warlike charge . <EOS>
<SOS> to business that we love we rise betimes and go to propn with delight . <EOS>
<SOS> a thousand , sir , early though propn be , have on their riveted trim and at the port expect you . <EOS>
<SOS> the morn is fair . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn well blown , lads . <EOS>
<SOS> this morning , like the spirit of a youth that means to be of note , begins betimes . <EOS>
<SOS> fare thee well , dame . <EOS>
<SOS> whate ’ er becomes of me , this is a soldier ’ s kiss . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll leave thee now like a man of steel . <EOS>
<SOS> lead me . <EOS>
<SOS> he goes forth gallantly . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods make this a happy day to propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed to make me fight at land ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou done so , the kings that have revolted , and the soldier that has this morning left thee , would have still followed thy heels . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s gone this morning ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ? <EOS>
<SOS> one ever near thee . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , he is with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , his chests and treasure he has not with him . <EOS>
<SOS> is he gone ? <EOS>
<SOS> most certain . <EOS>
<SOS> go , propn , send his treasure after . <EOS>
<SOS> do it . <EOS>
<SOS> detain no jot , i charge thee . <EOS>
<SOS> write to him— i will subscribe — gentle adieus and greetings . <EOS>
<SOS> say that i wish he never find more cause to change a master . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , my fortunes have corrupted honest men ! <EOS>
<SOS> dispatch .— propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> dead . <EOS>
<SOS> why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice . <EOS>
<SOS> if there were no more women but propn , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented . <EOS>
<SOS> this grief is crowned with consolation . <EOS>
<SOS> your old smock brings forth a new petticoat , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow . <EOS>
<SOS> the business she hath broached in the state can not endure my absence . <EOS>
<SOS> and the business you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of propn propn , which wholly depends on your abode . <EOS>
<SOS> no more light answers . <EOS>
<SOS> let our officers have notice what we purpose . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall break the cause of our expedience to the propn and get her leave to part . <EOS>
<SOS> for not alone the death of propn , with more urgent touches , do strongly speak to us , but the letters too of many our contriving friends in propn petition us at home . <EOS>
<SOS> much is breeding which , like the courser ’ s hair , hath yet but life , and not a serpent ’ s poison . <EOS>
<SOS> say our pleasure , to such whose place is under us , requires our quick remove from hence . <EOS>
<SOS> go forth , propn , and begin the fight . <EOS>
<SOS> our will is propn be took alive . <EOS>
<SOS> make it so known . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i shall . <EOS>
<SOS> the time of universal peace is near . <EOS>
<SOS> go charge propn propn those that have revolted in the vant , that propn may seem to spend his fury upon himself . <EOS>
<SOS> for this pains propn hath hanged him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honorable trust . <EOS>
<SOS> i have done ill , of which i do accuse myself so sorely that i will joy no more . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn propn after thee sent all thy treasure , with his bounty overplus . <EOS>
<SOS> the messenger came on my guard , and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules . <EOS>
<SOS> i give it you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn not , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i tell you true . <EOS>
<SOS> best you safed the bringer out of the host . <EOS>
<SOS> i must attend mine office , or would have done propn myself . <EOS>
<SOS> your emperor continues still a jove . <EOS>
<SOS> i am alone the villain of the earth , and feel i am so most . <EOS>
<SOS> o antony , thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid my better service , when my turpitude propn dost so crown with gold ! <EOS>
<SOS> this blows my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> if swift thought break it not , a swifter mean propn outstrike thought , but thought will do propn , i feel . <EOS>
<SOS> i fight against thee ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , i will go seek some ditch wherein to die . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn best fits my latter part of life . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> we have engaged ourselves too far . <EOS>
<SOS> propn himself has work , and our oppression exceeds what we expected . <EOS>
<SOS> o my brave propn , this is fought indeed ! <EOS>
<SOS> had we done so at first , we had droven them home with clouts about their heads . <EOS>
<SOS> thou bleed ’ st apace . <EOS>
<SOS> i had a wound here that was like a “ propn , ” but now propn made an “ propn ” they do retire . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll beat ’ em into bench - holes . <EOS>
<SOS> i have yet propn for six scotches more . <EOS>
<SOS> they are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves for a fair victory . <EOS>
<SOS> let us score their backs and snatch ’ em up , as we take hares , behind ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn sport to maul a runner . <EOS>
<SOS> i will reward thee once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold for thy good valor . <EOS>
<SOS> come thee on . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll halt after . <EOS>
<SOS> we have beat him to his camp . <EOS>
<SOS> run one before and let the propn know of our gests . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow , before the sun shall see propn , we ’ ll spill the blood that has today escaped . <EOS>
<SOS> propn of lords ! <EOS>
<SOS> o infinite virtue , propn thou smiling from the world ’ s great snare uncaught ? <EOS>
<SOS> mine nightingale , we have beat them to their beds . <EOS>
<SOS> what , girl , though gray do something mingle with our younger brown , yet propn we a brain that nourishes our nerves and can get goal for goal of youth . <EOS>
<SOS> behold this man . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath fought today as if a god , in hate of mankind , had destroyed in such a shape . <EOS>
<SOS> he has deserved it , were it carbuncled like holy propn car . <EOS>
<SOS> if we be not relieved within this hour , we must return to th ’ court of guard . <EOS>
<SOS> o bear me witness , night— what man is this ? <EOS>
<SOS> stand close and list him . <EOS>
<SOS> be witness to me , o thou blessèd moon , when men revolted shall upon record propn hateful memory , poor propn did before thy face repent . <EOS>
<SOS> enobarbus ? <EOS>
<SOS> peace ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn further . <EOS>
<SOS> throw my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault , which , being dried with grief , will break to powder and finish all foul thoughts . <EOS>
<SOS> o antony ! <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s speak to him . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s hear him , for the things he speaks may concern propn . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s do so . <EOS>
<SOS> but he sleeps . <EOS>
<SOS> swoons rather , for so bad a prayer as his was never yet for sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> go we to him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , awake . <EOS>
<SOS> speak to us . <EOS>
<SOS> hear you , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> the hand of death hath raught him . <EOS>
<SOS> let us bear him to propn court of guard . <EOS>
<SOS> he is of note . <EOS>
<SOS> our hour is fully out . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , then . <EOS>
<SOS> he may recover yet . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall do propn . <EOS>
<SOS> their preparation is today by sea . <EOS>
<SOS> we please them not by land . <EOS>
<SOS> for both , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i would they ’ d fight propn th ’ fire or i ’ th ’ air , we ’ d fight there too . <EOS>
<SOS> but this it is : our foot upon the hills adjoining to the city shall stay with us . <EOS>
<SOS> to the vales , and hold our best advantage . <EOS>
<SOS> yet they are not joined . <EOS>
<SOS> where yond pine does stand i shall discover all . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll bring thee word propn how ’ tis like to go . <EOS>
<SOS> swallows have built in propn ’ s sails their nests . <EOS>
<SOS> all is lost ! <EOS>
<SOS> this foul egyptian hath betrayèd me . <EOS>
<SOS> triple - turned whore ! <EOS>
<SOS> bid them all fly , for when i am revenged upon my charm , i have done all . <EOS>
<SOS> bid them all fly . <EOS>
<SOS> begone ! <EOS>
<SOS> o sun , thy uprise shall i see no more . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and propn part here . <EOS>
<SOS> even here do we shake hands . <EOS>
<SOS> all come to this ? <EOS>
<SOS> betrayed i am . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , this false soul of propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> ah , thou spell ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> why is my lord enraged against his love ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , or i shall give thee thy deserving , and blemish propn ’ s triumph . <EOS>
<SOS> let him take thee and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians ! <EOS>
<SOS> follow his chariot , like the greatest spot of all thy sex . <EOS>
<SOS> most monsterlike be shown for poor ’ st diminutives , for dolts , and let propn propn plow thy visage up with her preparèd nails ! <EOS>
<SOS> she dies for propn .— propn , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> help me , my women ! <EOS>
<SOS> to th ’ monument ! <EOS>
<SOS> there lock yourself and send him word you are dead . <EOS>
<SOS> the soul and body rive not more in parting than greatness going off . <EOS>
<SOS> say that the last i spoke was “ propn , ” and word it , prithee , piteously . <EOS>
<SOS> hence , mardian , and bring me how he takes my death . <EOS>
<SOS> eros , thou yet behold ’ st me ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , noble lord . <EOS>
<SOS> thou hast seen these signs . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> that which is now a horse , even with a thought the rack dislimns and makes it indistinct as water is in water . <EOS>
<SOS> it does , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> my good knave propn , now thy captain is even such a body . <EOS>
<SOS> here i am propn , yet can not hold this visible shape , my knave . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , weep not , gentle propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , thy vile lady ! <EOS>
<SOS> she has robbed me of my sword . <EOS>
<SOS> hence , saucy eunuch ! <EOS>
<SOS> peace ! <EOS>
<SOS> she hath betrayed me and shall die the death . <EOS>
<SOS> death of one person can be paid but once , and that she has discharged . <EOS>
<SOS> what thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand . <EOS>
<SOS> the last she spake was “ propn , most noble propn ! ” then in the midst a tearing groan did break the name of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> it was divided between her heart and lips . <EOS>
<SOS> she rendered life , propn name so buried in her . <EOS>
<SOS> dead , then ? <EOS>
<SOS> dead . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> go . <EOS>
<SOS> off , pluck off ! <EOS>
<SOS> o , cleave , my sides ! <EOS>
<SOS> heart , once be stronger than thy continent . <EOS>
<SOS> crack thy frail case ! —apace , propn , apace . <EOS>
<SOS> no more a soldier . <EOS>
<SOS> bruisèd pieces , go . <EOS>
<SOS> you have been nobly borne . <EOS>
<SOS> i will o ’ ertake thee , propn , and weep for my pardon . <EOS>
<SOS> since the torch is out , lie down and stray no farther . <EOS>
<SOS> now all labor propn what it does . <EOS>
<SOS> yea , very force entangles itself with strength . <EOS>
<SOS> seal then , and all is done.— propn come , my queen .— eros ! —stay for me . <EOS>
<SOS> where souls do couch on flowers , we ’ ll hand in hand , and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze . <EOS>
<SOS> dido and her propn shall want troops , and all the haunt be ours .— come , propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> what would my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> since propn died i have lived in such dishonor that the gods detest my baseness . <EOS>
<SOS> do propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the time is come . <EOS>
<SOS> thou strik ’ st not me , propn propn thou defeat ’ st . <EOS>
<SOS> put color in thy cheek . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods withhold me ! <EOS>
<SOS> shall i do that which all the parthian darts , though enemy , lost aim and could not ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn thou be windowed in great propn and see propn master thus with pleached arms , bending down his corrigible neck , his face subdued to penetrative shame , whilst the wheeled seat of fortunate propn , drawn before him , branded his baseness that ensued ? <EOS>
<SOS> i would not see propn . <EOS>
<SOS> draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn most useful for thy country . <EOS>
<SOS> o sir , pardon me ! <EOS>
<SOS> when i did make thee free , swor ’ st thou not then to do this when i bade thee ? <EOS>
<SOS> do it at once , or thy precedent services are all but accidents unpurposed . <EOS>
<SOS> draw and come . <EOS>
<SOS> turn from me then that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> where is he ? <EOS>
<SOS> i did not see him since . <EOS>
<SOS> what should i do i do not ? <EOS>
<SOS> in each thing give him way . <EOS>
<SOS> cross him in nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> tempt him not so too far . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish , forbear . <EOS>
<SOS> in time we hate that which we often fear . <EOS>
<SOS> but here comes propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sick and sullen . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— help me away , dear propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> i shall fall . <EOS>
<SOS> my sword is drawn . <EOS>
<SOS> my dear master , my captain , and my emperor , let me say , before i strike this bloody stroke , farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> propn said , man , and farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , great chief . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i strike now ? <EOS>
<SOS> now , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> why , there then ! <EOS>
<SOS> thus i do escape the sorrow of propn ’ s death . <EOS>
<SOS> my queen and eros have by their brave instruction got upon me a nobleness in record . <EOS>
<SOS> to do thus i learned of thee . <EOS>
<SOS> how ! <EOS>
<SOS> not dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , dispatch me ! <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the noise ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have done my work ill , friends . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , make an end of what i have begun ! <EOS>
<SOS> the star is fall ’ n . <EOS>
<SOS> and time is at his period . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , and woe ! <EOS>
<SOS> let him that loves me strike me dead . <EOS>
<SOS> not i . <EOS>
<SOS> nor i . <EOS>
<SOS> nor anyone . <EOS>
<SOS> propn death and fortunes bid thy followers fly . <EOS>
<SOS> this sword but shown to propn , with this tidings , shall enter me with him . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> there , propn , there . <EOS>
<SOS> lives he ? <EOS>
<SOS> wilt thou not answer , man ? <EOS>
<SOS> art thou there , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> draw thy sword and give me propn strokes for death . <EOS>
<SOS> most absolute lord , my mistress propn sent me to thee . <EOS>
<SOS> when did she send thee ? <EOS>
<SOS> now , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> where is she ? <EOS>
<SOS> locked in her monument . <EOS>
<SOS> she had a prophesying fear of what hath come to pass . <EOS>
<SOS> for when she saw— which never shall be found — you did suspect she had disposed with propn , and that your rage would not be purged , she sent you word she was dead . <EOS>
<SOS> too late , good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> call my guard , i prithee . <EOS>
<SOS> what ho , the propn ’ s guard ! <EOS>
<SOS> bear me , good friends , where propn bides . <EOS>
<SOS> propn the last service that i shall command you . <EOS>
<SOS> woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear all your true followers out . <EOS>
<SOS> most heavy day ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate to grace it with your sorrows . <EOS>
<SOS> bid that welcome which comes to punish us , and we punish it , seeming to bear it lightly . <EOS>
<SOS> take me up . <EOS>
<SOS> i have led you oft ; carry me now , good friends , and have my thanks for all . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , i will never go from hence . <EOS>
<SOS> be comforted , dear madam . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i will not . <EOS>
<SOS> all strange and terrible events are welcome , but comforts we despise . <EOS>
<SOS> our size of sorrow , proportioned to our cause , must be as great as that which makes it . <EOS>
<SOS> how now ? <EOS>
<SOS> is he dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> his death ’ s upon him , but not dead . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> help , propn , help , propn , help ! <EOS>
<SOS> peace ! <EOS>
<SOS> not propn ’ s valor hath o ’ erthrown propn , but propn ’ s hath triumphed on itself . <EOS>
<SOS> so it should be , that none but propn should conquer propn , but woe ’ tis so ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , but this dotage of our general propn o ’ erflows the measure . <EOS>
<SOS> those his goodly eyes , that o ’ er the files and musters of the war have glowed like plated propn , now bend , now turn the office and devotion of their view upon a tawny front . <EOS>
<SOS> his captain ’ s heart , which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst the buckles on his breast , reneges all temper and is become the bellows and the fan to cool a gypsy ’ s lust . <EOS>
<SOS> look where they come . <EOS>
<SOS> take but good note , and you shall see in him the triple pillar of the world transformed into a strumpet ’ s fool . <EOS>
<SOS> behold and see . <EOS>
<SOS> if it be love indeed , tell me how much . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s beggary in the love that can be reckoned . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll set a bourn how far to be beloved . <EOS>
<SOS> then must thou needs find out new propn , new earth . <EOS>
<SOS> news , my good lord , from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i am dying , propn , dying . <EOS>
<SOS> only i here importune death awhile , until of many thousand kisses the poor last i lay upon thy lips . <EOS>
<SOS> i dare not , dear , dear my lord , pardon , i dare not , propn i be taken . <EOS>
<SOS> not th ’ imperious show of the full - fortuned propn ever shall be brooched with me . <EOS>
<SOS> if knife , drugs , serpents , have propn , sting , or operation , i am safe . <EOS>
<SOS> your wife propn , with her modest eyes and still conclusion , shall acquire no honor demuring upon me . <EOS>
<SOS> assist , good friends . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , quick , or i am gone . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s sport indeed ! <EOS>
<SOS> how heavy weighs my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> had i great propn ’ s power , the strong - winged propn should fetch thee up and set thee by propn ’ s side . <EOS>
<SOS> and welcome , welcome ! <EOS>
<SOS> die when thou hast lived . <EOS>
<SOS> had my lips that power , thus would i wear them out . <EOS>
<SOS> a heavy sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> i am dying , propn , dying . <EOS>
<SOS> give me some wine and let me speak a little . <EOS>
<SOS> my resolution and my hands i ’ ll trust , none about propn . <EOS>
<SOS> now my spirit is going . <EOS>
<SOS> i can no more . <EOS>
<SOS> propn of men , woo ’ t die ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou no care of me ? <EOS>
<SOS> shall i abide in this dull world , which in thy absence is no better than a sty ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , withered is the garland of the war . <EOS>
<SOS> the soldier ’ s pole is fall ’ n ! <EOS>
<SOS> young boys and girls are level now with men . <EOS>
<SOS> the odds is gone , and there is nothing left remarkable propn the visiting moon . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s dead too , our sovereign . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> o madam , madam , madam ! <EOS>
<SOS> royal propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> peace , peace , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> no more but propn a woman , and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares . <EOS>
<SOS> all ’ s but naught . <EOS>
<SOS> how do you , women ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , what , good cheer ! <EOS>
<SOS> why , how now , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> my noble girls ! <EOS>
<SOS> good sirs , take heart . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll bury him , and then , what ’ s brave , what ’ s noble , let ’ s do propn after the high roman fashion and make death proud to take us . <EOS>
<SOS> come , away . <EOS>
<SOS> this case of that huge spirit now is cold . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , women , women ! <EOS>
<SOS> come . <EOS>
<SOS> we have no friend but resolution , and the briefest end . <EOS>
<SOS> go to him , propn , bid him yield . <EOS>
<SOS> being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks the pauses that he makes . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i shall . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is that ? <EOS>
<SOS> and what art thou that propn appear thus to us ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am called propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn i served , who best was worthy best to be served . <EOS>
<SOS> whilst he stood up and spoke , he was my master , and i wore my life to spend upon his haters . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou pleasest not , i yield thee up my life . <EOS>
<SOS> what is propn thou say ’ st ? <EOS>
<SOS> i say , o propn , propn is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack . <EOS>
<SOS> the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens . <EOS>
<SOS> the death of propn is not a single doom . <EOS>
<SOS> in the name lay a moiety of the world . <EOS>
<SOS> now , my dearest propn pray you , stand farther from me . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know by that same eye there ’ s some good news . <EOS>
<SOS> what , says the married woman you may go ? <EOS>
<SOS> would she had never given you leave to come ! <EOS>
<SOS> let her not say ’ tis i that keep you here . <EOS>
<SOS> i have no power upon you . <EOS>
<SOS> hers you are . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods best know— oh never was there queen so mightily betrayed ! <EOS>
<SOS> yet at the first i saw the treasons planted . <EOS>
<SOS> cleopatra— why should i think you can be mine , and true— though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods— who have been false to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> riotous madness , to be entangled with those mouth - made vows which break themselves in swearing ! <EOS>
<SOS> when you sued staying , then was the time for words . <EOS>
<SOS> no going then ! <EOS>
<SOS> eternity was in our lips and eyes , propn in our brows ’ bent , none our parts so poor but was a race of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> they are so still , or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , art turned the greatest liar . <EOS>
<SOS> this is his sword . <EOS>
<SOS> i robbed his wound of it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn it stained with his most noble blood . <EOS>
<SOS> look you , sad friends , the gods rebuke me , but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings . <EOS>
<SOS> his taints and honors waged equal with him . <EOS>
<SOS> a rarer spirit never did steer humanity , but you gods will give us some faults to make us men . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is touched . <EOS>
<SOS> i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day , or look on thine . <EOS>
<SOS> hear me , good friends— <EOS>
<SOS> but i will tell you at some meeter season . <EOS>
<SOS> the business of this man looks out of him . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll hear him what he says . <EOS>
<SOS> bid her have good heart . <EOS>
<SOS> she soon shall know of us , by some of ours , how honorable and how kindly we determine for her , for propn can not live to be ungentle . <EOS>
<SOS> so the gods preserve thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> go and say we purpose her no shame . <EOS>
<SOS> go , and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i shall . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , go you along . <EOS>
<SOS> where propn propn , to second propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> let him alone , for i remember now how he ’ s employed . <EOS>
<SOS> he shall in time be ready . <EOS>
<SOS> go with me and see what i can show in this . <EOS>
<SOS> propn paltry to be propn . <EOS>
<SOS> not being propn , he ’ s but propn ’ s knave , a minister of her will . <EOS>
<SOS> propn sends greeting to the propn of propn , and bids thee study on what fair demands thou mean ’ st to have him grant thee . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s thy name ? <EOS>
<SOS> my name is propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but i do not greatly care to be deceived , that have no use for trusting . <EOS>
<SOS> if your master would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , that majesty , to keep decorum , must no less beg than a kingdom . <EOS>
<SOS> if he please to give me conquered propn for my son , he gives me so much of mine own as i will kneel to him with thanks . <EOS>
<SOS> be of good cheer . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re fall ’ n into a princely hand . <EOS>
<SOS> fear nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> let me report to him your sweet dependency , and you shall find a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness where he for grace is kneeled to . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , tell him i am his fortune ’ s vassal , and i send him the greatness he has got . <EOS>
<SOS> i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience , and would gladly look him i ’ th ’ face . <EOS>
<SOS> this i ’ ll report , dear lady . <EOS>
<SOS> you see how easily she may be surprised . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> o propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> hold , worthy lady , hold ! <EOS>
<SOS> do not yourself such wrong , who are in this relieved but not betrayed . <EOS>
<SOS> what , of death too , that rids our dogs of languish ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , do not abuse my master ’ s bounty by propn undoing of yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> let the world see his nobleness well acted , which your death will never let come forth . <EOS>
<SOS> where art thou , death ? <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , come ! <EOS>
<SOS> come , come and take a queen worth many babes and beggars ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , temperance , lady ! <EOS>
<SOS> this mortal house i ’ ll ruin , do propn what he can . <EOS>
<SOS> know , sir , that i will not wait pinioned at your master ’ s court , nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull propn . <EOS>
<SOS> shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> rather a ditch in propn be gentle grave unto me . <EOS>
<SOS> rather on propn mud propn me stark naked and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring . <EOS>
<SOS> rather make my country ’ s high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains ! <EOS>
<SOS> you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , what thou hast done thy master propn knows , and he hath sent for thee . <EOS>
<SOS> for the propn , i ’ ll take her to my guard . <EOS>
<SOS> so , propn , it shall content me best . <EOS>
<SOS> be gentle to her . <EOS>
<SOS> most noble propn , you have heard of me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can not tell . <EOS>
<SOS> you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams . <EOS>
<SOS> is propn not your trick ? <EOS>
<SOS> i understand not , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i dreamt there was an emperor antony . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , such another sleep , that i might see but such another man ! <EOS>
<SOS> his reared arm propn the world . <EOS>
<SOS> for his bounty , there was no winter in propn , an autumn ’ twas that grew the more by reaping . <EOS>
<SOS> in his livery walked crowns and crownets . <EOS>
<SOS> realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket . <EOS>
<SOS> cleopatra— think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of ? <EOS>
<SOS> gentle madam , no . <EOS>
<SOS> you lie up to the hearing of the gods . <EOS>
<SOS> nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy , yet t ’ imagine an propn were nature ’ s piece ’ gainst fancy , condemning shadows quite . <EOS>
<SOS> hear me , good madam . <EOS>
<SOS> your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it as answering to the weight . <EOS>
<SOS> would i might never o ’ ertake pursued success , but i do feel , by the rebound of yours , a grief that smites my very heart at root . <EOS>
<SOS> i thank you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> know you what propn means to do with me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am loath to tell you what i would you knew . <EOS>
<SOS> arise , you shall not kneel . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , rise . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , the gods will have it thus . <EOS>
<SOS> take to you no hard thoughts . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll take my leave . <EOS>
<SOS> and may , through all the world ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn yours , and we , your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall hang in what place you please . <EOS>
<SOS> here , my good lord . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> i would i had thy inches . <EOS>
<SOS> thou shouldst know there were a heart in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> hear me , propn : the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile , but my full heart remains in use with you . <EOS>
<SOS> our propn shines o ’ er with civil swords . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn makes his approaches to the port of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my more particular , and that which most with you should safe my going , is propn ’ s death . <EOS>
<SOS> can propn die ? <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s dead , my propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall advise me in all for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the brief of money , plate , and jewels i am possessed of . <EOS>
<SOS> propn exactly valued , not petty things admitted . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s seleucus ? <EOS>
<SOS> here , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> this is my treasurer . <EOS>
<SOS> let him speak , my lord , upon his peril , that i have reserved to myself nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i had rather seal my lips than to my peril speak that which is not . <EOS>
<SOS> what have i kept back ? <EOS>
<SOS> enough to purchase what you have made known . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , blush not , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> see , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , behold how pomp is followed ! <EOS>
<SOS> the ingratitude of this propn does even make me wild . <EOS>
<SOS> thou shalt go back , i warrant thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll catch thine eyes , though they had wings . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , rarely base ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i ’ th ’ roll of conquest . <EOS>
<SOS> still be ’ t yours . <EOS>
<SOS> bestow it at your pleasure , and believe propn propn no merchant , to make prize with you of things that merchants sold . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore be cheered . <EOS>
<SOS> no , dear propn , for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel . <EOS>
<SOS> feed and sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend . <EOS>
<SOS> and so , adieu . <EOS>
<SOS> my master , and my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> not so . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but , hark thee , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> finish , good lady . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i will . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s the propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> make your best use of this . <EOS>
<SOS> i have performed your pleasure and my promise . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i shall remain your debtor . <EOS>
<SOS> i your servant . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i must attend on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , and thanks . <EOS>
<SOS> now , propn , what think ’ st thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou an egyptian puppet shalt be shown in propn , as well as i . <EOS>
<SOS> mechanic slaves with greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall uplift us to the view . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods forbid ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , ’ tis most certain , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , the good gods ! <EOS>
<SOS> nay , that ’ s certain . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll never see propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> for i am sure mine nails are stronger than mine eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> why , that ’ s the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents . <EOS>
<SOS> now , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> show me , my women , like a queen . <EOS>
<SOS> go fetch my best attires . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn this noise ? <EOS>
<SOS> here is a rural fellow that will not be denied your propn presence . <EOS>
<SOS> he brings you figs . <EOS>
<SOS> let him come in . <EOS>
<SOS> what poor an instrument may do a noble deed ! <EOS>
<SOS> he brings me liberty . <EOS>
<SOS> my resolution ’ s placed , and i have nothing of woman in me . <EOS>
<SOS> now from head to foot i am marble - constant . <EOS>
<SOS> now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the man . <EOS>
<SOS> avoid , and leave him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou the pretty worm of propn there , that kills and pains not ? <EOS>
<SOS> truly , i have him , but i would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal . <EOS>
<SOS> those that do die of it do seldom or never recover . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou any that have died on propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> very many , men and women too . <EOS>
<SOS> truly , she makes a very good report o ’ propn worm . <EOS>
<SOS> but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do . <EOS>
<SOS> but this is most falliable , the worm ’ s an odd worm . <EOS>
<SOS> i wish you all joy of the worm . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , ay . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for indeed there is no goodness in the worm . <EOS>
<SOS> very good . <EOS>
<SOS> will it eat me ? <EOS>
<SOS> you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman . <EOS>
<SOS> well , get thee gone . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> give me my robe . <EOS>
<SOS> put on my crown . <EOS>
<SOS> i have immortal longings in me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , yare , good propn , quick . <EOS>
<SOS> methinks i hear propn call . <EOS>
<SOS> i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act . <EOS>
<SOS> i hear him mock the luck of propn , which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath .— propn , i come ! <EOS>
<SOS> now to that name my courage prove my title ! <EOS>
<SOS> i am fire and air , my other elements i give to baser life .— so , have you done ? <EOS>
<SOS> come then and take the last warmth of my lips . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , kind propn . <EOS>
<SOS> iras , long farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> have i the aspic in my lips ? <EOS>
<SOS> dost fall ? <EOS>
<SOS> if thou and nature can so gently part , the stroke of death is as a lover ’ s pinch , which hurts , and is desired . <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou lie still ? <EOS>
<SOS> if thus thou vanishest , thou tell ’ st the world it is not worth leave - taking . <EOS>
<SOS> dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that i may say the gods themselves do weep ! <EOS>
<SOS> come , thou mortal wretch , with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie . <EOS>
<SOS> poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , couldst thou speak , that i might hear thee call great propn ass unpolicied ! <EOS>
<SOS> o eastern star ! <EOS>
<SOS> peace , peace ! <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou not see my baby at my breast , that sucks the nurse asleep ? <EOS>
<SOS> as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle— o antony ! —nay , i will take thee too . <EOS>
<SOS> what should i stay— in this wild world ? <EOS>
<SOS> so , fare thee well . <EOS>
<SOS> now boast thee , death , in thy possession lies a lass unparalleled . <EOS>
<SOS> propn windows , close , <EOS>
<SOS> and golden phoebus never be beheld of eyes again so royal ! <EOS>
<SOS> your crown ’ s awry . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll mend it and then play— where propn the propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> speak softly . <EOS>
<SOS> wake her not . <EOS>
<SOS> propn hath sent— too slow a messenger . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , come apace , dispatch ! <EOS>
<SOS> i partly feel thee . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s propn sent from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> call him . <EOS>
<SOS> what work is here , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> is this well done ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is well done and fitting for a princess descended of so many royal kings . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , soldier ! <EOS>
<SOS> how goes it here ? <EOS>
<SOS> all dead . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , thy thoughts touch their effects in this . <EOS>
<SOS> thyself art coming to see performed the dreaded act which thou so sought ’ st to hinder . <EOS>
<SOS> o most false love ! <EOS>
<SOS> where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water ? <EOS>
<SOS> now i see , i see , in propn ’ s death how mine received shall be . <EOS>
<SOS> by the fire that quickens propn slime , i go from hence propn soldier , servant , making peace or war as thou affects . <EOS>
<SOS> cut my lace , propn , come ! <EOS>
<SOS> but let it be . <EOS>
<SOS> i am quickly ill , and well , so propn loves . <EOS>
<SOS> my precious propn , forbear , and give true evidence to his love which stands an honorable trial . <EOS>
<SOS> so propn told me . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , turn aside and weep for her . <EOS>
<SOS> then bid adieu to me , and say the tears belong to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> o sir , you are too sure an augurer . <EOS>
<SOS> that you did fear is done . <EOS>
<SOS> the manner of their deaths ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do not see them bleed . <EOS>
<SOS> who was last with them ? <EOS>
<SOS> a simple countryman that brought her figs . <EOS>
<SOS> this was his basket . <EOS>
<SOS> poisoned , then . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , propn , this propn lived but now . <EOS>
<SOS> she stood and spake . <EOS>
<SOS> i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress . <EOS>
<SOS> tremblingly she stood and on the sudden dropped . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , noble weakness ! <EOS>
<SOS> here on her breast there is a vent of blood , and something blown . <EOS>
<SOS> the like is on her arm . <EOS>
<SOS> this is an aspic ’ s trail , and these fig leaves have slime upon them , such as th ’ aspic leaves upon the caves of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> take up her bed and bear her women from the monument . <EOS>
<SOS> she shall be buried by her propn . <EOS>
<SOS> no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous . <EOS>
<SOS> our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral , and then to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> come , propn , see high order in this great solemnity . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ ll heat my blood . <EOS>
<SOS> no more . <EOS>
<SOS> you can do better yet , but this is meetly . <EOS>
<SOS> now , by my sword— and target . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll leave you , lady . <EOS>
<SOS> courteous lord , one word . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you and i must part , but that ’ s not it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn sweating labor to bear such idleness so near the heart as propn this . <EOS>
<SOS> but , sir , forgive me , since my becomings kill me when they do not propn well to you . <EOS>
<SOS> your honor calls you hence . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , and all the gods go with you ! <EOS>
<SOS> upon your sword propn laurel victory , and smooth success be strewed before your feet . <EOS>
<SOS> let us go . <EOS>
<SOS> come . <EOS>
<SOS> our separation so abides and flies that thou , residing here , goes yet with me , and i , hence fleeting , here remain with thee . <EOS>
<SOS> you are too indulgent . <EOS>
<SOS> say this becomes him— as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things can not blemish — yet must propn no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness . <EOS>
<SOS> if he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness , full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s more news . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is strong at sea , and it appears he is beloved of those that only have feared propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i should have known no less . <EOS>
<SOS> it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were , and the ebbed man , propn loved till propn worth love , comes deared by being lacked . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i bring thee word menecrates and propn , famous pirates , make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound with keels of every kind . <EOS>
<SOS> many hot inroads they make in propn — the borders maritime propn blood to think on propn — and flush youth revolt . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , leave thy lascivious wassails . <EOS>
<SOS> when thou once propn beaten from propn , where thou propn propn and propn , consuls , at thy heel did famine follow , whom thou fought ’ st against , though daintily brought up , with patience more than savages could suffer . <EOS>
<SOS> thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at . <EOS>
<SOS> propn pity of him . <EOS>
<SOS> let his shames quickly drive him to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn time we twain did show ourselves i ’ th ’ field , and to that end assemble we immediate council . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn in our idleness . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow , propn , i shall be furnished to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time . <EOS>
<SOS> till which encounter it is my business too . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> charmian ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> that i might sleep out this great gap of time my propn is away . <EOS>
<SOS> you think of him too much . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , ’ tis treason ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i trust , not so . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s your highness ’ pleasure ? <EOS>
<SOS> not now to hear thee sing . <EOS>
<SOS> i take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has . <EOS>
<SOS> propn well for thee that , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou affections ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , gracious madam . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed ? <EOS>
<SOS> not in deed , madam , for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done . <EOS>
<SOS> stands he or sits he ? <EOS>
<SOS> or does he walk ? <EOS>
<SOS> or is he on his horse ? <EOS>
<SOS> o happy horse , to bear the weight of propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s speaking now , or murmuring “ where ’ s my serpent of old propn ? ” for so he calls me . <EOS>
<SOS> now i feed myself with most delicious poison . <EOS>
<SOS> think on me , that am with phoebus ’ amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , hear them , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> perform propn , or else we damn thee . ” how , my love ? <EOS>
<SOS> perchance ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , and most like . <EOS>
<SOS> you must not stay here longer . <EOS>
<SOS> call in the messengers . <EOS>
<SOS> as i am propn ’ s queen , propn blushest , propn , and that blood of thine is propn ’ s homager . <EOS>
<SOS> the messengers ! <EOS>
<SOS> sovereign of propn , hail ! <EOS>
<SOS> how much unlike art thou propn propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> yet , coming from him , that great med ’ cine hath with his tinct gilded thee . <EOS>
<SOS> how goes it with my brave propn propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> last thing he did , dear propn , he kissed — the last of many doubled kisses— this orient pearl . <EOS>
<SOS> mine ear must pluck it thence . <EOS>
<SOS> good friend , ” quoth he , “ say the firm propn to great propn sends this treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , to mend the petty present , i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms . <EOS>
<SOS> all the propn , propn thou , shall call her mistress . ” so he nodded , and soberly did mount an arm - gaunt steed , who neighed so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbed by him . <EOS>
<SOS> what was he , sad or merry ? <EOS>
<SOS> like to the time propn th ’ year between the extremes of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry . <EOS>
<SOS> note him , note him , good propn , ’ tis the man , but note him . <EOS>
<SOS> he was not sad , for he would shine on those that make their looks by his . <EOS>
<SOS> he was not merry , which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay in propn with his joy , but between both . <EOS>
<SOS> o heavenly mingle ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou sad or merry , the violence of either thee becomes , so does it no man else .— propn thou my posts ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , madam , twenty several messengers . <EOS>
<SOS> why do you send so thick ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s born that day when i forget to send to propn shall die a beggar . <EOS>
<SOS> ink and paper , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , my good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> did i , propn , ever love propn so ? <EOS>
<SOS> oh , that brave propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> be choked with such another emphasis ! <EOS>
<SOS> say , “ the brave propn . ” the valiant propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with propn paragon again my man of men . <EOS>
<SOS> by your most gracious pardon , i sing but after you . <EOS>
<SOS> my salad days , when i was green in judgment , cold in blood , to say as i said then . <EOS>
<SOS> we , ignorant of ourselves , propn often our own harms , which the wise powers deny us for our good , so find we profit by losing of our prayers . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall do well . <EOS>
<SOS> the people love me , and the sea is mine . <EOS>
<SOS> my powers are crescent , and my auguring hope says it will come to th ’ full . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn in propn sits at dinner , and will make no wars without doors . <EOS>
<SOS> propn gets money where he loses hearts . <EOS>
<SOS> lepidus flatters both , of both is flattered , but he neither loves , nor either cares for him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and propn are in the field . <EOS>
<SOS> a mighty strength they carry . <EOS>
<SOS> where have you this ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn false . <EOS>
<SOS> from propn , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> he dreams . <EOS>
<SOS> i know they are in propn together looking for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but all the charms of love , propn propn , soften thy wanned lip ! <EOS>
<SOS> let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both . <EOS>
<SOS> tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , keep his brain fuming . <EOS>
<SOS> this is most certain that i shall deliver : propn propn is every hour in propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> since he went from propn propn a space for farther travel . <EOS>
<SOS> his soldiership is twice the other twain . <EOS>
<SOS> but let us rear the higher our opinion , that our stirring can from the lap of propn ’ s widow pluck the propn lust - wearied propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not hope propn and propn shall well greet together . <EOS>
<SOS> i know not , propn , how lesser enmities may give way to greater . <EOS>
<SOS> be propn as our gods will have propn . <EOS>
<SOS> it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands . <EOS>
<SOS> come , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , ’ tis a worthy deed , and shall become you well , to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall entreat him to answer like himself . <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , were i the wearer of propn ’ s beard , i would not shave propn today . <EOS>
<SOS> propn not a time for private stomaching . <EOS>
<SOS> but small to greater matters must give way . <EOS>
<SOS> not if the small come first . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes the noble propn . <EOS>
<SOS> and yonder , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn spoken well . <EOS>
<SOS> were we before our armies , and to fight , i should do thus . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> thank you . <EOS>
<SOS> sit . <EOS>
<SOS> sit , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , then . <EOS>
<SOS> i must be laughed at propn or for nothing or a little , i should say myself offended , and with you propn propn th ’ world ; more laughed at , that i should once name you derogately , when to sound your name it not concerned me . <EOS>
<SOS> my being in propn , propn , what was propn to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> no more than my residing here at propn might be to you in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> yet if you there did practice on my state , your being in propn might be my question . <EOS>
<SOS> how intend you , “ practiced ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me . <EOS>
<SOS> your wife and brother made wars upon me , and their contestation was theme for you . <EOS>
<SOS> you were the word of war . <EOS>
<SOS> you do mistake your business . <EOS>
<SOS> my brother never did urge me in his act . <EOS>
<SOS> did he not rather propn my authority with yours , and make the wars alike against my stomach , having alike your cause ? <EOS>
<SOS> of this my letters before did satisfy you . <EOS>
<SOS> if you ’ ll patch a quarrel , as matter whole you have to make it with , it must not be with this . <EOS>
<SOS> you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me , but you patched up your excuses . <EOS>
<SOS> not so , not so . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you could not lack , i am certain on propn , very necessity of this thought , that i , your partner in the cause ’ gainst which he fought , could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace . <EOS>
<SOS> as for my wife , i would you had her spirit in such another . <EOS>
<SOS> the third propn th ’ world is yours , which with a snaffle you may pace easy , but not such a wife . <EOS>
<SOS> for that you must but say i could not help it . <EOS>
<SOS> i wrote to you when rioting in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> three kings i had newly feasted , and did want of what i was propn th ’ morning . <EOS>
<SOS> but next day i told him of myself , which was as much as to have asked him pardon . <EOS>
<SOS> let this fellow be nothing of our strife . <EOS>
<SOS> hear the ambassadors . <EOS>
<SOS> no messenger but thine , and all alone tonight we ’ ll wander through the streets and note the qualities of people . <EOS>
<SOS> you have broken the article of your oath , which you shall never have tongue to charge me with . <EOS>
<SOS> soft , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> no , propn , let him speak . <EOS>
<SOS> the honor is sacred which he talks on now , supposing that i lacked it .— but , on , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the article of my oath ? <EOS>
<SOS> to lend me arms and aid when i required them , the which you both denied . <EOS>
<SOS> neglected , rather , and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge . <EOS>
<SOS> propn noble spoken . <EOS>
<SOS> if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye , to forget them quite were to remember that the present need propn to atone you . <EOS>
<SOS> worthily spoken , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> or , if you borrow one another ’ s love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of propn , return it again . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art a soldier only . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore speak no more . <EOS>
<SOS> go to , then . <EOS>
<SOS> give me leave , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> speak , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> thou hast a sister by the mother ’ s side , propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> great propn propn is now a widower . <EOS>
<SOS> say not so , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> if propn heard you , your reproof were well deserved of rashness . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not married , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> let me hear propn further speak . <EOS>
<SOS> by this marriage , all little jealousies , which now seem great , and all great fears , which now import their dangers , would then be nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her . <EOS>
<SOS> will propn speak ? <EOS>
<SOS> the power of propn , and his power unto propn . <EOS>
<SOS> may i never to this good purpose , that so fairly shows , dream of impediment ! <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s my hand . <EOS>
<SOS> a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly . <EOS>
<SOS> let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never fly off our loves again ! <EOS>
<SOS> happily , amen ! <EOS>
<SOS> i did not think to draw my sword ’ gainst propn , for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me . <EOS>
<SOS> time calls upon ’ s . <EOS>
<SOS> of us must propn presently be sought , or else he seeks out us . <EOS>
<SOS> where lies he ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is his strength by land ? <EOS>
<SOS> great and increasing . <EOS>
<SOS> but by sea he is an absolute master . <EOS>
<SOS> so is the fame . <EOS>
<SOS> let us , propn , not lack your company . <EOS>
<SOS> noble propn , not sickness should detain me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested . <EOS>
<SOS> you stayed well by propn in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast — and but twelve persons there ! <EOS>
<SOS> is this true ? <EOS>
<SOS> this was but as a fly by an eagle . <EOS>
<SOS> we had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her . <EOS>
<SOS> i will tell you . <EOS>
<SOS> the poop was beaten gold , propn the sails , and so perfumèd that the winds were lovesick with them . <EOS>
<SOS> the oars were silver , which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made the water which they beat to follow faster , as amorous of their strokes . <EOS>
<SOS> on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling propn , with divers - colored fans , whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , and what they undid did . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , rare for propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> upon her landing , propn sent to her , invited her to supper . <EOS>
<SOS> she replied it should be better he became her guest , which she entreated . <EOS>
<SOS> royal wench ! <EOS>
<SOS> now propn must leave her utterly . <EOS>
<SOS> age can not wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety . <EOS>
<SOS> other women cloy the appetites they feed , but she makes hungry where most she satisfies , for vilest things become themselves in her , that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish . <EOS>
<SOS> let us go . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , make yourself my guest whilst you abide here . <EOS>
<SOS> humbly , sir , i thank you . <EOS>
<SOS> all which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you . <EOS>
<SOS> good night . <EOS>
<SOS> if you can , your reason ? <EOS>
<SOS> but yet hie you to propn again . <EOS>
<SOS> say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , propn propn or mine ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore , o propn , stay not by his side . <EOS>
<SOS> thy dæmon — that thy spirit which keeps thee — is noble , courageous , high , unmatchable where propn propn is not . <EOS>
