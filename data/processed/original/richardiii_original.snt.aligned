<SOS> why , so . <EOS>
<SOS> now have i done a good day ’ s work . <EOS>
<SOS> you peers , continue this united league . <EOS>
<SOS> dissemble not your hatred . <EOS>
<SOS> swear your love . <EOS>
<SOS> and with my hand i seal my true heart ’ s love . <EOS>
<SOS> and i as i love propn with my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> you have been factious one against the other.— propn , love propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> dorset , embrace him .— propn , love propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> this interchange of love , i here protest , upon my part shall be inviolable . <EOS>
<SOS> and so swear i . <EOS>
<SOS> now , princely propn , seal thou this league with thy embracements to my wife ’ s allies and make me happy in your unity . <EOS>
<SOS> a pleasing cordial , princely propn , is this thy vow unto my sickly heart . <EOS>
<SOS> and in good time , here comes propn propn propn and the duke . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow to my sovereign king and queen , and , princely peers , a happy time of day . <EOS>
<SOS> happy indeed , as we have spent the day . <EOS>
<SOS> a blessèd labor , my most sovereign lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn death to me to be at enmity ; i hate it , and desire all good men ’ s love . <EOS>
<SOS> a holy day shall this be kept hereafter . <EOS>
<SOS> i would to propn all strifes were well compounded . <EOS>
<SOS> my sovereign lord , i do beseech your highness to take our brother propn to your grace . <EOS>
<SOS> why , madam , have i offered love for this , to be so flouted in this royal presence ? <EOS>
<SOS> who knows not that the gentle duke is dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> who knows not he is dead ! <EOS>
<SOS> who knows he is ? <EOS>
<SOS> all - seeing propn , what a world is this ! <EOS>
<SOS> look i so pale , propn propn , as the rest ? <EOS>
<SOS> is clarence dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> the order was reversed . <EOS>
<SOS> but he , poor man , by your first order died , and that a wingèd propn did bear . <EOS>
<SOS> some tardy cripple bear the countermand , that came too lag to see him burièd . <EOS>
<SOS> propn grant that some , less noble and less loyal , propn in bloody thoughts , and not in blood , deserve not worse than wretched propn did , and yet go current from suspicion . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , peace . <EOS>
<SOS> my soul is full of sorrow . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not rise unless your propn hear me . <EOS>
<SOS> then say at once what is it thou requests . <EOS>
<SOS> the forfeit , sovereign , of my servant ’ s life , who slew today a riotous gentleman lately attendant on the duke of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> we know thy charge , propn , and will obey . <EOS>
<SOS> we are the queen ’ s abjects and must propn propn , farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> i know it pleaseth neither of us well . <EOS>
<SOS> well , your imprisonment shall not be long . <EOS>
<SOS> i will deliver you or else lie for you . <EOS>
<SOS> meantime , have patience . <EOS>
<SOS> i must perforce . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return . <EOS>
<SOS> simple , plain propn , i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to propn , if propn will take the present at our hands . <EOS>
<SOS> but who comes here ? <EOS>
<SOS> good time of day unto my gracious lord . <EOS>
<SOS> as much unto my good propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> well are you welcome to the open air . <EOS>
<SOS> how hath your lordship brooked imprisonment ? <EOS>
<SOS> my brother killed no man ; his fault was thought , and yet his punishment was bitter death . <EOS>
<SOS> who sued to me for him ? <EOS>
<SOS> this is the fruits of rashness . <EOS>
<SOS> propn you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen looked pale when they did hear of propn ' death ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , they did urge it still unto the king . <EOS>
<SOS> propn will revenge it . <EOS>
<SOS> come , lords , will you go to comfort propn with our company ? <EOS>
<SOS> we wait upon your grace . <EOS>
<SOS> good grandam , tell us , is our father dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> my pretty cousins , you mistake me both . <EOS>
<SOS> then , you conclude , my grandam , he is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> the king mine uncle is to blame for it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn will revenge it , whom i will importune with earnest prayers , all to that effect . <EOS>
<SOS> and so will i . <EOS>
<SOS> peace , children , peace . <EOS>
<SOS> the king doth love you well . <EOS>
<SOS> incapable and shallow innocents , you can not guess who caused your father ’ s death . <EOS>
<SOS> think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not think it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , what noise is this ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll join with black despair against my soul and to myself become an enemy . <EOS>
<SOS> why grow the branches when the root is gone ? <EOS>
<SOS> why wither not the leaves that want their sap ? <EOS>
<SOS> if you will live , lament . <EOS>
<SOS> if die , be brief , that our swift - wingèd souls may catch the king propn , or , like obedient subjects , follow him to his new kingdom of ne'er - changing night . <EOS>
<SOS> o , what cause have i , propn being but a moiety of my moan , to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries ! <EOS>
<SOS> all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes , that i , being governed by the watery moon , may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , for my husband , for my dear lord propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> ah , for our father , for our dear lord propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> alas for both , both mine , propn and propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> what stay had i but propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> and he ’ s gone . <EOS>
<SOS> what stay had we but propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> and he ’ s gone . <EOS>
<SOS> and they are gone . <EOS>
<SOS> was never widow had so dear a loss . <EOS>
<SOS> were never orphans had so dear a loss . <EOS>
<SOS> was never mother had so dear a loss . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , i am the mother of these griefs . <EOS>
<SOS> she for an propn weeps , and so do i ; i for a propn weep ; so doth not she . <EOS>
<SOS> these babes for propn weep and so do i ; i for an propn weep ; so do not they . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , bethink you , like a careful mother , of the young prince your son . <EOS>
<SOS> in him your comfort lives . <EOS>
<SOS> sister , have comfort . <EOS>
<SOS> all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star , but none can help our harms by wailing them.— propn , my mother , i do cry you mercy ; i did not see your grace . <EOS>
<SOS> humbly on my knee i crave your blessing . <EOS>
<SOS> propn bless thee , and put meekness in thy breast , love , charity , obedience , and true duty . <EOS>
<SOS> you cloudy princes and heart - sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan , now cheer each other in each other ’ s love . <EOS>
<SOS> though we have spent our harvest of this king , we are to reap the harvest of his son . <EOS>
<SOS> the broken rancor of your high - swoll'n hates , but lately splintered , knit , and joined together , must gently be preserved , cherished , and kept . <EOS>
<SOS> propn good that with some little train propn from propn the young prince be fet propn to propn , to be crowned our king . <EOS>
<SOS> why “ with some little train , ” my propn of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i hope the king made peace with all of us ; and the compact is firm and true in me . <EOS>
<SOS> and so in me , and so , i think , in all . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore i say with noble propn that it is meet so few should fetch the prince . <EOS>
<SOS> and so say i . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , whoever journeys to the prince , for propn ’ s sake let not us two at home . <EOS>
<SOS> for by the way i ’ ll sort occasion , as index to the story we late talked of , to part the queen ’ s proud kindred from the prince . <EOS>
<SOS> my other self , my council ’ s consistory , my oracle , my prophet , my dear cousin , i , as a child , will go by thy direction toward propn then , for we ’ ll not stay behind . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ? <EOS>
<SOS> i promise you i scarcely know myself . <EOS>
<SOS> hear you the news abroad ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , that the king is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> neighbors , propn speed . <EOS>
<SOS> give you good morrow , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> doth this news hold of good propn propn ’ s death ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , sir , it is too true , propn help the while . <EOS>
<SOS> then , masters , look to see a troublous world . <EOS>
<SOS> no , no , by propn ’ s good grace , his son shall reign . <EOS>
<SOS> woe to the land that ’ s governed by a child . <EOS>
<SOS> in him there is a hope of government , which , in his nonage , council under him , and , in his full and ripened years , himself , no doubt shall then , and till then , govern well . <EOS>
<SOS> with patience , noble lord , as prisoners must . <EOS>
<SOS> more pity that the eagle should be mewed while kites and buzzards prey at liberty . <EOS>
<SOS> what news abroad ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn very grievous to be thought upon . <EOS>
<SOS> where is he , in his bed ? <EOS>
<SOS> he is . <EOS>
<SOS> go you before , and i will follow you . <EOS>
<SOS> so stood the state when propn the propn was crowned in propn but at nine months old . <EOS>
<SOS> stood the state so ? <EOS>
<SOS> better it were they all came by his father , or by the father there were none at all , for emulation who shall now be nearest will touch us all too near if propn prevent not . <EOS>
<SOS> o , full of danger is the duke of propn , and the queen ’ s sons and brothers haught and proud , and were they to be ruled , and not to rule , this sickly land might solace as before . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come , we fear the worst . <EOS>
<SOS> all will be well . <EOS>
<SOS> untimely storms make men expect a dearth . <EOS>
<SOS> all may be well ; but if propn sort it so , ' propn more than we deserve or i expect . <EOS>
<SOS> before the days of change , still is it so . <EOS>
<SOS> but leave it all to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> whither away ? <EOS>
<SOS> marry , we were sent for to the justices . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow or next day they will be here . <EOS>
<SOS> i long with all my heart to see the prince . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope he is much grown since last i saw him . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , mother , but i would not have it so . <EOS>
<SOS> why , my young cousin ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is good to grow . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , one night as we did sit at supper , my uncle rivers talked how i did grow more than my brother : “ ay , ” quoth my uncle propn , “ small herbs have grace ; great weeds do grow apace . ” and since , methinks i would not grow so fast because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste . <EOS>
<SOS> good faith , good faith , the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> he was the wretched ’ st thing when he was young , so long a - growing and so leisurely , that if this rule were true , he should be gracious . <EOS>
<SOS> and so no doubt he is , my gracious madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope he is , but yet let mothers doubt . <EOS>
<SOS> now , by my troth , if i had been remembered , i could have given my uncle ’ s grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touched mine . <EOS>
<SOS> how , my pretty york ? <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee let me hear it . <EOS>
<SOS> marry , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old . <EOS>
<SOS> twas full two years ere i could get a tooth . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , this would have been a biting jest . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , pretty propn , who told thee this ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , his nurse . <EOS>
<SOS> his nurse ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , she was dead ere thou wast born . <EOS>
<SOS> if ’ twere not she , i can not tell who told me . <EOS>
<SOS> a parlous boy ! <EOS>
<SOS> go to , you are too shrewd . <EOS>
<SOS> good madam , be not angry with the child . <EOS>
<SOS> pitchers have ears . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes a messenger . <EOS>
<SOS> what news ? <EOS>
<SOS> such news , my lord , as grieves me to report . <EOS>
<SOS> how doth the prince ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , madam , and in health . <EOS>
<SOS> what is thy news then ? <EOS>
<SOS> the mighty dukes , propn and propn . <EOS>
<SOS> for what offence ? <EOS>
<SOS> the sum of all i can , i have disclosed . <EOS>
<SOS> why , or for what , the nobles were committed is all unknown to me , my gracious lord . <EOS>
<SOS> ay me ! <EOS>
<SOS> i see the ruin of my house . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre . <EOS>
<SOS> my husband lost his life to get the crown , and often up and down my sons were tossed for me to joy , and weep , their gain and loss . <EOS>
<SOS> o , preposterous and frantic outrage , end thy damnèd spleen , or let me die , to look on death no more . <EOS>
<SOS> the weary way hath made you melancholy . <EOS>
<SOS> no , uncle , but our crosses on the way have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy . <EOS>
<SOS> i want more uncles here to welcome me . <EOS>
<SOS> those uncles which you want were dangerous . <EOS>
<SOS> your grace attended to their sugared words but looked not on the poison of their hearts . <EOS>
<SOS> propn keep you from them , and from such false friends . <EOS>
<SOS> propn keep me from false friends , but they were none . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , the mayor of propn comes to greet you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn bless your grace with health and happy days . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , what a slug is propn that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no ! <EOS>
<SOS> and in good time here comes the sweating lord . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> what , will our mother come ? <EOS>
<SOS> on what occasion propn he knows , not i , the queen your mother and your brother propn have taken sanctuary . <EOS>
<SOS> the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace , but by his mother was perforce withheld . <EOS>
<SOS> not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin . <EOS>
<SOS> weigh it but with the grossness of this age , you break not sanctuary in seizing him . <EOS>
<SOS> this prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it and therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn have i heard of sanctuary men , but sanctuary children , ne'er till now . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , you shall o'errule my mind for once.— come on , propn propn , will you go with me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i go , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> good lords , make all the speedy haste you may . <EOS>
<SOS> say , uncle propn , if our brother come , where shall we sojourn till our coronation ? <EOS>
<SOS> where it seems best unto your royal self . <EOS>
<SOS> i do not like the propn , of any place.— did propn propn build that place , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> he did , my gracious lord , begin that place , which , since , succeeding ages have re - edified . <EOS>
<SOS> is it upon record , or else reported successively from age to age , he built it ? <EOS>
<SOS> upon record , my gracious lord . <EOS>
<SOS> but say , my lord , it were not registered , methinks the truth should live from age to age , as propn retailed to all posterity , even to the general all - ending day . <EOS>
<SOS> what say you , uncle ? <EOS>
<SOS> death makes no conquest of this conqueror , for now he lives in fame , though not in life . <EOS>
<SOS> he can not live , i hope , and must not die propn propn be packed with post - horse up to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> for then i ’ ll marry propn ’ s youngest daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> what though i killed her husband and her father ? <EOS>
<SOS> the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father ; the which will i , not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto . <EOS>
<SOS> but yet i run before my horse to market . <EOS>
<SOS> propn still breathes ; propn still lives and reigns . <EOS>
<SOS> when they are gone , then must i count my gains . <EOS>
<SOS> what , my gracious lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn of propn , how fares our loving brother ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , my dread lord — so must i call you now . <EOS>
<SOS> how fares our cousin , noble propn of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i thank you , gentle uncle . <EOS>
<SOS> o , my lord , you said that idle weeds are fast in growth . <EOS>
<SOS> the prince my brother hath outgrown me far . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> and therefore is he idle ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , my fair cousin , i must not say so . <EOS>
<SOS> then is he more beholding to you than i . <EOS>
<SOS> he may command me as my sovereign , but you have power in me as in a kinsman . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , uncle , give me this dagger . <EOS>
<SOS> my dagger , little cousin ? <EOS>
<SOS> with all my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> a beggar , brother ? <EOS>
<SOS> of my kind uncle , that i know will give , and being but a toy , which is no grief to give . <EOS>
<SOS> a greater gift than that i ’ ll give my cousin . <EOS>
<SOS> a greater gift ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , that ’ s the sword to it . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , gentle cousin , were it light enough . <EOS>
<SOS> o , then i see you will part but with light gifts . <EOS>
<SOS> in weightier things you ’ ll say a beggar nay . <EOS>
<SOS> it is too heavy for your grace to wear . <EOS>
<SOS> i weigh it lightly , were it heavier . <EOS>
<SOS> how ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , your grace knows how to bear with him . <EOS>
<SOS> you mean , to bear me , not to bear with me.— propn , my brother mocks both you and me . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall not sleep in quiet at the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> why , what should you fear ? <EOS>
<SOS> marry , my uncle propn ' angry ghost . <EOS>
<SOS> my grandam told me he was murdered there . <EOS>
<SOS> i fear no uncles dead . <EOS>
<SOS> nor none that live , i hope . <EOS>
<SOS> an if they live , i hope i need not fear . <EOS>
<SOS> no doubt , no doubt . <EOS>
<SOS> o , ’ tis a parlous boy , propn , quick , ingenious , forward , capable . <EOS>
<SOS> he is all the mother propn , from the top to toe . <EOS>
<SOS> well , let them rest .— come hither , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he , for his father ’ s sake , so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him . <EOS>
<SOS> what think ’ st thou then of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> will not he ? <EOS>
<SOS> he will do all in all as propn doth . <EOS>
<SOS> well then , no more but this : go , gentle propn , and , as it were far off , sound thou propn propn how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the propn to sit about the coronation . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou dost find him tractable to us , encourage him and show him all our reasons . <EOS>
<SOS> if he be leaden , icy , cold , unwilling , be thou so too , and so break off the talk , and give us notice of his inclination ; for we tomorrow hold divided councils , wherein thyself shalt highly be employed . <EOS>
<SOS> commend me to propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my good lords both , with all the heed i can . <EOS>
<SOS> shall we hear from you , propn , ere we sleep ? <EOS>
<SOS> you shall , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> at propn propn , there shall you find us both . <EOS>
<SOS> now , my lord , what shall we do , if we perceive propn propn will not yield to our complots ? <EOS>
<SOS> chop off his head . <EOS>
<SOS> something we will determine . <EOS>
<SOS> and look when i am king , claim thou of me the earldom of propn , and all the moveables propn the king my brother was possessed . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll claim that promise at your propn ’ s hands . <EOS>
<SOS> and look to have it yielded with all kindness . <EOS>
<SOS> come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form . <EOS>
<SOS> one from the propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> upon the stroke of four . <EOS>
<SOS> can not my propn propn sleep these tedious nights ? <EOS>
<SOS> so it appears by that i have to say . <EOS>
<SOS> first , he commends him to your noble self . <EOS>
<SOS> what then ? <EOS>
<SOS> then certifies your lordship that this night he dreamt the boar had razèd his helm besides , he says there are two councils kept , and that may be determined at the one which may make you and him to rue at th ' other . <EOS>
<SOS> his honor and myself are at the one , and at the other is my good friend propn , where nothing can proceed that toucheth us propn i shall not have intelligence . <EOS>
<SOS> tell him his fears are shallow , without instance . <EOS>
<SOS> and for his dreams , i wonder he ’ s so simple to trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers . <EOS>
<SOS> to fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase . <EOS>
<SOS> many good morrows to my noble lord . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you are early stirring . <EOS>
<SOS> what news , what news in this our tott'ring state ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is a reeling world indeed , my lord , and i believe will never stand upright till propn wear the garland of the realm . <EOS>
<SOS> how “ wear the garland ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou mean the crown ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , my good lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders before i ’ ll see the crown so foul misplaced . <EOS>
<SOS> but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , on my life , and hopes to find you forward upon his party for the gain thereof ; and thereupon he sends you this good news , that this same very day your enemies , the kindred of the queen , must die at propn . <EOS>
<SOS> indeed , i am no mourner for that news , because they have been still my adversaries . <EOS>
<SOS> propn keep your lordship in that gracious mind . <EOS>
<SOS> well , propn , ere a fortnight make me older i ’ ll send some packing that yet think not on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a vile thing to die , my gracious lord , when men are unprepared and look not for it . <EOS>
<SOS> o monstrous , monstrous ! <EOS>
<SOS> and so falls it out with propn , propn , propn ; and so ’ twill do with some men else that think themselves as safe as thou and i , who , as thou know ’ st , are dear to princely propn and to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the princes both make high account of you— i know they do , and i have well deserved it . <EOS>
<SOS> fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , good morrow . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow , propn you may jest on , but , by the propn propn , i do not like these several councils , i . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i hold my life as dear as you do yours , and never in my days , i do protest , was it so precious to me as ’ tis now . <EOS>
<SOS> think you but that i know our state secure , i would be so triumphant as i am ? <EOS>
<SOS> pray propn , i say , i prove a needless coward ! <EOS>
<SOS> what , shall we toward the propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> the day is spent . <EOS>
<SOS> set down , set down your honorable load , if honor may be shrouded in a hearse , propn i awhile obsequiously lament propn ' untimely fall of virtuous propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn you what , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> today the lords you talked of are beheaded . <EOS>
<SOS> they , for their truth , might better wear their heads than some that have accused them wear their hats . <EOS>
<SOS> but come , my lord , let ’ s away . <EOS>
<SOS> go on before . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll talk with this good fellow . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , sirrah ! <EOS>
<SOS> how goes the world with thee ? <EOS>
<SOS> the better that your lordship please to ask . <EOS>
<SOS> i tell thee , man , ’ tis better with me now than when thou propn me last where now we meet . <EOS>
<SOS> but now , i tell thee — keep it to thyself— this day those enemies are put to death , and i in better state than propn i was . <EOS>
<SOS> propn hold it , to your propn ’ s good content ! <EOS>
<SOS> there , drink that for me . <EOS>
<SOS> i thank your honor . <EOS>
<SOS> well met , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i am glad to see your honor . <EOS>
<SOS> i thank thee , good propn propn , with all my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> i am in your debt for your last exercise . <EOS>
<SOS> come the next sabbath , and i will content you . <EOS>
<SOS> your friends at propn , they do need the priest ; your propn hath no shriving work in hand . <EOS>
<SOS> good faith , and when i met this holy man , the men you talk of came into my mind . <EOS>
<SOS> what , go you toward the propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i shall return before your lordship thence . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , like enough , for i stay dinner there . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll wait upon your lordship . <EOS>
<SOS> dispatch . <EOS>
<SOS> the limit of your lives is out . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> o thou bloody prison , fatal and ominous to noble peers ! <EOS>
<SOS> now propn ’ s curse is fall'n upon our heads , when she exclaimed on propn , you , and i , for standing by when propn stabbed her son . <EOS>
<SOS> then cursed she propn . <EOS>
<SOS> o , remember , propn , to hear her prayer for them , as now for us ! <EOS>
<SOS> and for my sister and her princely sons , be satisfied , dear propn , with our true blood , which , as thou know ’ st , unjustly must be spilt . <EOS>
<SOS> make haste . <EOS>
<SOS> the hour of death is expiate . <EOS>
<SOS> come , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> come , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> let us all embrace . <EOS>
<SOS> in propn ’ s name , speak . <EOS>
<SOS> when is the royal day ? <EOS>
<SOS> is all things ready for the royal time ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is , and wants but nomination . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow , then , i judge a happy day . <EOS>
<SOS> who knows the propn propn ’ s mind herein ? <EOS>
<SOS> who is most inward with the noble duke ? <EOS>
<SOS> your grace , we think , should soonest know his mind . <EOS>
<SOS> we know each other ’ s faces ; for our hearts , he knows no more of mine than i of yours , or i of his , my lord , than you of mine.— propn propn , you and he are near in love . <EOS>
<SOS> i thank his grace . <EOS>
<SOS> i know he loves me well . <EOS>
<SOS> but for his purpose in the coronation , i have not sounded him , nor he delivered his gracious pleasure any way therein . <EOS>
<SOS> but you , my honorable lords , may name the time , and in the duke ’ s behalf i ’ ll give my voice , which i presume he ’ ll take in gentle part . <EOS>
<SOS> in happy time here comes the duke himself . <EOS>
<SOS> my noble lords and cousins all , good morrow . <EOS>
<SOS> had you not come upon your cue , my lord , propn propn propn had pronounced your part— i mean your voice for crowning of the king . <EOS>
<SOS> than my propn propn no man might be bolder . <EOS>
<SOS> propn of propn , a word with you . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll go with you . <EOS>
<SOS> we have not yet set down this day of triumph . <EOS>
<SOS> where is my lord the duke of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have sent for these strawberries . <EOS>
<SOS> his grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s some conceit or other likes him well when that he bids good morrow with such spirit . <EOS>
<SOS> i think there ’ s never a man in propn can lesser hide his love or hate than he , for by his face straight shall you know his heart . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray propn he be not , i say . <EOS>
<SOS> then be your eyes the witness of their evil . <EOS>
<SOS> if they have done this deed , my noble lord— if ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou protector of this damnèd strumpet , propn thou to me of “ ifs ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou art a traitor— off with his head . <EOS>
<SOS> woe , woe for propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn did dream the boar did raze his helm , and i did scorn it and disdain to fly . <EOS>
<SOS> three times today my foot - cloth horse did stumble , and started when he looked upon the propn , as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse . <EOS>
<SOS> o , now i need the priest that spake to me ! <EOS>
<SOS> i now repent i told the pursuivant , as too triumphing , how mine enemies today at propn bloodily were butchered , and i myself secure in grace and favor . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , propn , now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor propn ' wretched head . <EOS>
<SOS> make a short shrift . <EOS>
<SOS> he longs to see your head . <EOS>
<SOS> o momentary grace of mortal men , which we more hunt for than the grace of propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> who builds his hopes in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast , ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come , dispatch . <EOS>
<SOS> propn bootless to exclaim . <EOS>
<SOS> o bloody propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , i prophesy the propn time to thee that ever wretched age hath looked upon.— come , lead me to the block . <EOS>
<SOS> bear him my head . <EOS>
<SOS> they smile at me that shortly shall be dead . <EOS>
<SOS> propn looks are at my service , like enforcèd smiles , and both are ready in their offices , at any time to grace my stratagems . <EOS>
<SOS> but what , is propn gone ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , o'erlook the walls . <EOS>
<SOS> if ever he have wife , let her be made more miserable by the death of him than i am made by my poor lord and thee.— come now towards propn with your holy load , taken from propn ’ s to be interrèd there . <EOS>
<SOS> what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , the reason we have sent— look back ! <EOS>
<SOS> defend thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> here are enemies . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and our innocence defend and guard us ! <EOS>
<SOS> be patient . <EOS>
<SOS> they are friends , propn and propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here is the head of that ignoble traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected propn . <EOS>
<SOS> so dear i loved the man that i must weep . <EOS>
<SOS> so smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue that , his apparent open guilt omitted— i mean his conversation with propn ’ s wife— he lived from all attainder of suspects . <EOS>
<SOS> had he done so ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , think you we are propn or infidels ? <EOS>
<SOS> i never looked for better at his hands after he once fell in with propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but , my good lord , your graces ' words shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak ; and do not doubt , right noble princes both , but i ’ ll acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this case . <EOS>
<SOS> and to that end we wished your lordship here propn ' avoid the censures of the carping world . <EOS>
<SOS> moreover , urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust , which stretched to their servants , daughters , wives , even where his raging eye or savage heart , without control , lusted to make his prey . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , for a need , thus far come near my person : tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate propn , noble propn my princely father then had wars in propn , and , by true computation of the time , found that the issue was not his begot , which well appearèd in his lineaments , being nothing like the noble duke my father . <EOS>
<SOS> yet touch this sparingly , as ’ twere far off , because , my lord , you know my mother lives . <EOS>
<SOS> and so , my lord , adieu . <EOS>
<SOS> if you thrive well , bring them to propn ’ s propn , where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well - learnèd bishops . <EOS>
<SOS> i go ; and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the propn affords . <EOS>
<SOS> go , propn , with all speed to propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of propn out of sight , and to give order that no manner of person have any time recourse unto the princes . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the indictment of the good propn propn , which in a set hand fairly is engrossed , that it may be today read o'er in propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s a good world the while . <EOS>
<SOS> who is so gross that can not see this palpable device ? <EOS>
<SOS> bad is the world , and all will come to naught when such ill dealing must be seen in thought . <EOS>
<SOS> now , by the holy mother of our propn , the citizens are mum , say not a word . <EOS>
<SOS> touched you the bastardy of propn ’ s children ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> his answer was , the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder . <EOS>
<SOS> would not they speak ? <EOS>
<SOS> will not the mayor then and his brethren come ? <EOS>
<SOS> the mayor is here at hand . <EOS>
<SOS> and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen , good my lord , for on that ground i ’ ll make a holy descant . <EOS>
<SOS> and be not easily won to our requests . <EOS>
<SOS> i go . <EOS>
<SOS> an if you plead as well for them as i can say “ nay ” to thee for myself , no doubt we bring it to a happy issue . <EOS>
<SOS> go , go , up to the leads . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn propn knocks . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i think the duke will not be spoke withal . <EOS>
<SOS> now , propn , what says your lord to my request ? <EOS>
<SOS> he doth entreat your grace , my noble lord , to visit him tomorrow or next day . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , good propn , to the gracious duke . <EOS>
<SOS> tell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , no less importing than our general good , in deep designs , and matters of great moment are come to have some conference with his grace . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll signify so much unto him straight . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> he is not lolling on a lewd love bed , but on his knees at meditation ; not dallying with a brace of courtesans , but meditating with two deep divines ; not sleeping , to engross his idle body , but praying , to enrich his watchful soul . <EOS>
<SOS> happy were propn would this virtuous prince take on his grave the sovereignty thereof . <EOS>
<SOS> but sure i fear we shall not win him to it . <EOS>
<SOS> marry , propn defend his grace should say us nay ! <EOS>
<SOS> i fear he will . <EOS>
<SOS> here propn comes again . <EOS>
<SOS> now , propn , what says his grace ? <EOS>
<SOS> he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to come to him , his grace not being warned thereof before . <EOS>
<SOS> he fears , my lord , you mean no good to him . <EOS>
<SOS> sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him . <EOS>
<SOS> when holy and devout religious men are at their beads , ’ tis much to draw them thence , so sweet is zealous contemplation . <EOS>
<SOS> see where his propn stands , ’ tween two clergymen . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , there needs no such apology . <EOS>
<SOS> i do beseech your propn pardon me , who , earnest in the service of my propn , deferred the visitation of my friends . <EOS>
<SOS> i do suspect i have done some offense that seems disgracious in the city ’ s eye , and that you come to reprehend my ignorance . <EOS>
<SOS> you have , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , behold this pattern of thy butcheries . <EOS>
<SOS> o , gentlemen , see , see dead propn ’ s wounds open their congealed mouths and bleed propn propn , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , for ’ tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells . <EOS>
<SOS> o earth , which this blood drink ’ st revenge his death ! <EOS>
<SOS> either propn with lightning strike the murderer dead , or earth gape open wide and eat him quick , as thou dost swallow up this good king ’ s blood , which his hell - governed arm hath butcherèd ! <EOS>
<SOS> if not to answer , you might haply think tongue - tied ambition , not replying , yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , which fondly you would here impose on me . <EOS>
<SOS> first , if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth , yet so much is my poverty of spirit , so mighty and so many my defects , that i would rather hide me from my greatness , being a bark to brook no mighty sea , than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered . <EOS>
<SOS> but , propn be thanked , there is no need of me , and much i need to help you , were there need . <EOS>
<SOS> the royal tree hath left us royal fruit , which , mellowed by the stealing hours of time , will well become the seat of majesty , and make , no doubt , us happy by his reign . <EOS>
<SOS> on him i lay what you would lay on me , the right and fortune of his happy stars , which propn defend that i should wring from him . <EOS>
<SOS> for first was he contract to propn propn your mother lives a witness to that vow— and afterward by substitute betrothed to propn , sister to the king of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> these both put off , a poor petitioner , a care - crazed mother to a many sons , a beauty - waning and distressèd widow , even in the afternoon of her best days , made prize and purchase of his wanton eye , seduced the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathed bigamy . <EOS>
<SOS> refuse not , mighty lord , this proffered love . <EOS>
<SOS> o , make them joyful . <EOS>
<SOS> grant their lawful suit . <EOS>
<SOS> alas , why would you heap this care on me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am unfit for state and majesty . <EOS>
<SOS> i do beseech you , take it not amiss ; i can not , nor i will not , yield to you . <EOS>
<SOS> zounds , i ’ ll entreat no more . <EOS>
<SOS> o , do not swear , my lord of propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> if you deny them , all the land will rue it . <EOS>
<SOS> will you enforce me to a world of cares ? <EOS>
<SOS> call them again . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not made of stones , but penetrable to your kind entreaties , propn against my conscience and my soul . <EOS>
<SOS> propn bless your grace ! <EOS>
<SOS> we see it and will say it . <EOS>
<SOS> in saying so , you shall but say the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> then i salute you with this royal title : long live propn , propn ’ s worthy king ! <EOS>
<SOS> amen . <EOS>
<SOS> tomorrow will it please you to be crowned ? <EOS>
<SOS> even when you please , since you will have it so . <EOS>
<SOS> who meets us here ? <EOS>
<SOS> my niece propn propn in the hand of her kind aunt of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> now , for my life , she ’ s wandering to the propn , on pure heart ’ s love , to greet the tender prince.— propn , well met . <EOS>
<SOS> whither away ? <EOS>
<SOS> no farther than the propn , and , as i guess , upon the like devotion as yourselves , to gratulate the gentle princes there . <EOS>
<SOS> kind sister , thanks . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll enter all together . <EOS>
<SOS> and in good time here the lieutenant comes.— propn propn , pray you , by your leave , how doth the prince and my young son of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> right well , dear madam . <EOS>
<SOS> by your patience , i may not suffer you to visit them . <EOS>
<SOS> the king hath strictly charged the contrary . <EOS>
<SOS> the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i mean , the propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the propn protect him from that kingly title ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn he set bounds between their love and me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am their mother . <EOS>
<SOS> who shall bar me from them ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am their father ’ s mother . <EOS>
<SOS> i will see them . <EOS>
<SOS> their aunt i am in law , in love their mother . <EOS>
<SOS> then bring me to their sights . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll bear thy blame and take thy office from thee , on my peril . <EOS>
<SOS> no , madam , no . <EOS>
<SOS> i may not leave it so . <EOS>
<SOS> i am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me . <EOS>
<SOS> let me but meet you ladies one hour hence , and i ’ ll salute your propn of propn as mother and reverend looker - on , of two fair queens . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , cut my lace asunder , that my pent heart may have some scope to beat , or else i swoon with this dead - killing news ! <EOS>
<SOS> o , unpleasing news ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn mother ’ s name is ominous to children . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall have letters from me to my son in your behalf , to meet you on the way . <EOS>
<SOS> be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay . <EOS>
<SOS> o ill - dispersing wind of misery ! <EOS>
<SOS> and i in all unwillingness will go . <EOS>
<SOS> o , would to propn that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were red - hot steel to sear me to the brains ! <EOS>
<SOS> to feed my humor , wish thyself no harm . <EOS>
<SOS> no ? <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> poor heart , adieu . <EOS>
<SOS> i pity thy complaining . <EOS>
<SOS> no more than from my soul i mourn for yours . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , thou woeful welcomer of glory . <EOS>
<SOS> rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow for tender princes , use my babies well . <EOS>
<SOS> so foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you know no rules of charity , which renders good for bad , blessings for curses . <EOS>
<SOS> villain , thou know ’ st not law of propn nor man . <EOS>
<SOS> no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity . <EOS>
<SOS> but i know none , and therefore am no beast . <EOS>
<SOS> more wonderful , when angels are so angry . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , divine perfection of a woman , of these supposèd crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , defused infection of a man , of these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursèd self . <EOS>
<SOS> fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself . <EOS>
<SOS> fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself . <EOS>
<SOS> by such despair i should accuse myself . <EOS>
<SOS> my gracious sovereign . <EOS>
<SOS> give me thy hand . <EOS>
<SOS> thus high , by thy advice and thy assistance is propn propn seated . <EOS>
<SOS> but shall we wear these glories for a day , or shall they last and we rejoice in them ? <EOS>
<SOS> still live they , and forever let them last . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , propn , now do i play the touch , to try if thou be current gold indeed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn lives ; think now what i would speak . <EOS>
<SOS> say on , my loving lord . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn so — but propn lives . <EOS>
<SOS> true , noble prince . <EOS>
<SOS> o bitter consequence that propn still should live “ true noble prince ” ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , thou wast not wo nt to be so dull . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i be plain ? <EOS>
<SOS> what sayest thou now ? <EOS>
<SOS> your grace may do your pleasure . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , tut , thou art all ice ; thy kindness freezes . <EOS>
<SOS> say , have i thy consent that they shall die ? <EOS>
<SOS> give me some little breath , some pause , dear lord , before i positively speak in this . <EOS>
<SOS> i will resolve you herein presently . <EOS>
<SOS> and unrespective boys . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is his name ? <EOS>
<SOS> his name , my lord , is propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i partly know the man . <EOS>
<SOS> go , call him hither , boy no more shall be the neighbor to my counsels propn he so long held out with me , untired , and stops he now for breath ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , be it so . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , propn propn , what ’ s the news ? <EOS>
<SOS> know , my long lord , the marquess propn , as i hear , is fled to propn , in the parts where he abides . <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn it abroad that propn my wife is very grievous sick . <EOS>
<SOS> inquire me out some mean poor gentleman , whom i will marry straight to propn ' daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> look how thou dream ’ st ! <EOS>
<SOS> i say again , give out that propn my queen is sick and like to die . <EOS>
<SOS> is thy name propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , and your most obedient subject . <EOS>
<SOS> art thou indeed ? <EOS>
<SOS> dar ’ st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine ? <EOS>
<SOS> why then , thou hast it . <EOS>
<SOS> two deep enemies , foes to my rest , and my sweet sleep ’ s disturbers , are they that i would have thee deal upon . <EOS>
<SOS> tyrrel , i mean those bastards in the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> let me have open means to come to them , and soon i ’ ll rid you from the fear of them . <EOS>
<SOS> thou sing ’ st sweet music . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , come hither , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> go , by this token . <EOS>
<SOS> rise , and lend thine ear . <EOS>
<SOS> there is no more but so . <EOS>
<SOS> say it is done , and i will love thee and prefer thee for it . <EOS>
<SOS> i will dispatch it straight . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i have considered in my mind the late request that you did sound me in . <EOS>
<SOS> well , let that rest . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is fled to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i hear the news , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , he is your wife ’ s son . <EOS>
<SOS> well , look unto it . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i claim the gift , my due by promise , for which your honor and your faith is pawned— propn ' earldom of propn and the movables which you promisèd i shall possess . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , look to your wife . <EOS>
<SOS> if she convey letters to propn , you shall answer it . <EOS>
<SOS> what says your highness to my just request ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do remember me , propn the propn did prophesy that propn should be king , when propn was a little peevish boy . <EOS>
<SOS> a king , perhaps— my lord— how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me , i being by , that i should kill him ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , your promise for the earldom— propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> when last i was at propn , the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it propn , at which name i started , because a bard of propn told me once i should not live long after i saw propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn ay , what ’ s o'clock ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me . <EOS>
<SOS> well , but what ’ s o'clock ? <EOS>
<SOS> upon the stroke of ten . <EOS>
<SOS> well , let it strike . <EOS>
<SOS> why let it strike ? <EOS>
<SOS> because that , like a jack , thou keep ’ st the stroke propn thy begging and my meditation . <EOS>
<SOS> i am not in the giving vein today . <EOS>
<SOS> why then , resolve me whether you will or no . <EOS>
<SOS> thou troublest me ; i am not in the vein . <EOS>
<SOS> and is it thus ? <EOS>
<SOS> repays he my deep service with such deep contempt ? <EOS>
<SOS> made i him king for this ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , let me think on propn and be gone to propn , while my fearful head is on ! <EOS>
<SOS> the tyrannous and bloody act is done , the most arch deed of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and propn , whom i did suborn to do this piece of ruthless butchery , propn they were fleshed villains , bloody dogs , melted with tenderness and mild compassion , wept like two children in their deaths ' sad story . <EOS>
<SOS> their lips were four red roses on a stalk , and in their summer beauty kissed each other . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , am i happy in thy news ? <EOS>
<SOS> if to have done the thing you gave in charge propn your happiness , be happy then , for it is done . <EOS>
<SOS> but propn thou see them dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> i did , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> and buried , gentle propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> the chaplain of the propn hath buried them , but where , to say the truth , i do not know . <EOS>
<SOS> come to me , propn , soon at after - supper , when thou shalt tell the process of their death . <EOS>
<SOS> meantime , but think how i may do thee good , and be inheritor of thy desire . <EOS>
<SOS> farewell till then . <EOS>
<SOS> i humbly take my leave . <EOS>
<SOS> the son of propn have i pent up close , his daughter meanly have i matched in marriage , the sons of propn sleep in propn ’ s bosom , and propn my wife hath bid this world goodnight . <EOS>
<SOS> now , for i know the propn propn aims at young propn , my brother ’ s daughter , and by that knot looks proudly on the crown , to her go i , a jolly thriving wooer . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> good or bad news , that thou propn in so bluntly ? <EOS>
<SOS> bad news , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is fled to propn , and propn , backed with the hardy propn , is in the field , and still his power increaseth . <EOS>
<SOS> propn with propn troubles me more near than propn and his rash - levied strength . <EOS>
<SOS> say that i slew them not . <EOS>
<SOS> then say they were not slain . <EOS>
<SOS> but dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee . <EOS>
<SOS> i did not kill your husband . <EOS>
<SOS> why then , he is alive . <EOS>
<SOS> in thy foul throat thou liest . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn saw propn murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood , the which thou once didst bend against her breast , but that thy brothers beat aside the point . <EOS>
<SOS> i was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue , that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders . <EOS>
<SOS> thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind , that never dream ’ st on aught but butcheries . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou not kill this king ? <EOS>
<SOS> i grant you . <EOS>
<SOS> dost grant me , hedgehog ? <EOS>
<SOS> then , propn grant me too propn mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed . <EOS>
<SOS> o , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous . <EOS>
<SOS> the better for the propn of propn that hath him . <EOS>
<SOS> he is in propn , where thou shalt never come . <EOS>
<SOS> let him thank me , that holp to send him thither , for he was fitter for that place than earth . <EOS>
<SOS> here in these confines slyly have i lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies . <EOS>
<SOS> a dire induction am i witness to , and will to propn , hoping the consequence will prove as bitter , black , and tragical . <EOS>
<SOS> withdraw thee , wretched propn . <EOS>
<SOS> who comes here ? <EOS>
<SOS> ah , my poor princes ! <EOS>
<SOS> ah , my tender babes , my unblown flowers , new - appearing sweets , if yet your gentle souls fly in the air and be not fixed in doom perpetual , propn about me with your airy wings and hear your mother ’ s lamentation . <EOS>
<SOS> propn about her ; say that right for right propn dimmed your infant morn to agèd night . <EOS>
<SOS> so many miseries have crazed my voice that my woe - wearied tongue is still and mute . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , why art thou dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> wilt thou , o propn , fly from such gentle lambs and throw them in the entrails of the wolf ? <EOS>
<SOS> when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ? <EOS>
<SOS> give mine the benefit of seigniory , and let my griefs frown on the upper hand . <EOS>
<SOS> i had a propn too , and thou did ’ st kill him ; i had a propn too ; thou holp ’ st to kill him . <EOS>
<SOS> o upright , just , and true - disposing propn , how do i thank thee that this carnal cur propn on the issue of his mother ’ s body and makes her pew - fellow with others ' moan ! <EOS>
<SOS> o propn ’ s wife , triumph not in my woes ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn witness with me , i have wept for thine . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn he is dead , that killed my propn , propn other propn dead , to quit my propn ; propn propn , he is but boot , because both they matched not the high perfection of my loss . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn he is dead that stabbed my propn , and the beholders of this frantic play , propn ' adulterate propn , propn , propn , propn , untimely smothered in their dusky graves . <EOS>
<SOS> propn yet lives , hell ’ s black intelligencer , only reserved their factor to buy souls and send them thither . <EOS>
<SOS> cancel his bond of life , dear propn i pray , that i may live to say , “ the dog is dead . ” <EOS>
<SOS> o , thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me curse that bottled spider , that foul bunch - backed toad ! <EOS>
<SOS> i called thee then “ vain flourish of my fortune . ” i called thee then poor shadow , “ painted queen , ” the presentation of but what i was , the flattering index of a direful pageant , one heaved a - high , to be hurled down below , a mother only mocked with two fair babes , a dream of what thou wast , a garish flag to be the aim of every dangerous shot , a sign of dignity , a breath , a bubble , a queen in jest , only to fill the scene . <EOS>
<SOS> where is thy husband now ? <EOS>
<SOS> where be thy brothers ? <EOS>
<SOS> where are thy two sons ? <EOS>
<SOS> thus hath the course of justice whirled about and left thee but a very prey to time , having no more but thought of what thou wast to torture thee the more , being what thou art . <EOS>
<SOS> thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not propn the just proportion of my sorrow ? <EOS>
<SOS> these english woes will make me smile in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> o , thou well - skilled in curses , stay awhile , and teach me how to curse mine enemies . <EOS>
<SOS> forbear to sleep the nights , and fast the days ; compare dead happiness with living woe ; think that thy babes were sweeter than they were , and he that slew them fouler than he is . <EOS>
<SOS> bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse . <EOS>
<SOS> revolving this will teach thee how to curse . <EOS>
<SOS> my words are dull . <EOS>
<SOS> o , quicken them with thine ! <EOS>
<SOS> thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine . <EOS>
<SOS> why should calamity be full of words ? <EOS>
<SOS> if so , then be not tongue - tied . <EOS>
<SOS> go with me , and in the breath of bitter words let ’ s smother my damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered . <EOS>
<SOS> who intercepts my expedition ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , she that might have intercepted thee , by strangling thee in her accursèd womb , from all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou that forehead with a golden crown where should be branded , if that right were right , the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown and the dire death of my poor sons and brothers ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell me , thou villain - slave , where are my children ? <EOS>
<SOS> where is gentle propn , propn , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> where is kind propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> strike alarum , drums ! <EOS>
<SOS> let not the heavens hear these telltale women propn on the propn propn anointed . <EOS>
<SOS> strike , i say ! <EOS>
<SOS> either be patient and entreat me fair , or with the clamorous report of war thus will i drown your exclamations . <EOS>
<SOS> art thou my son ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , i thank propn , my father , and yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> then patiently hear my impatience . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i have a touch of your condition , which can not brook the accent of reproof . <EOS>
<SOS> o , let me speak ! <EOS>
<SOS> do then , but i ’ ll not hear . <EOS>
<SOS> i will be mild and gentle in my words . <EOS>
<SOS> and brief , good mother , for i am in haste . <EOS>
<SOS> art thou so hasty ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have stayed for thee , propn knows , in torment and in agony . <EOS>
<SOS> and came i not at last to comfort you ? <EOS>
<SOS> what comfortable hour canst thou name , that ever graced me in thy company ? <EOS>
<SOS> faith , none but propn propn , that called your grace to breakfast once , forth of my company . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , hear me speak . <EOS>
<SOS> you speak too bitterly . <EOS>
<SOS> hear me a word , for i shall never speak to thee again . <EOS>
<SOS> so . <EOS>
<SOS> though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse propn in me . <EOS>
<SOS> i say amen to her . <EOS>
<SOS> stay , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i must talk a word with you . <EOS>
<SOS> i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter . <EOS>
<SOS> you have a daughter called propn , virtuous and fair , royal and gracious . <EOS>
<SOS> and must she die for this ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , let her live , and i ’ ll corrupt her manners , stain her beauty , propn myself as false to propn ’ s bed , throw over her the veil of infamy . <EOS>
<SOS> so she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter , i will confess she was not propn ’ s daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> wrong not her birth . <EOS>
<SOS> she is a royal princess . <EOS>
<SOS> to save her life , i ’ ll say she is not so . <EOS>
<SOS> and only in that safety died her brothers . <EOS>
<SOS> no , to their lives ill friends were contrary . <EOS>
<SOS> my babes were destined to a fairer death if grace had blessed thee with a fairer life . <EOS>
<SOS> whose hand soever launched their tender hearts , propn head , all indirectly , gave direction . <EOS>
<SOS> no doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stone - hard heart , to revel in the entrails of my lambs . <EOS>
<SOS> but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes , and i , in such a desp'rate bay of death , like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft , propn all to pieces on thy rocky bosom . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , so thrive i in my enterprise and dangerous success of bloody wars as i intend more good to you and yours than ever you or yours were by me harmed ! <EOS>
<SOS> what good is covered with the face of propn , to be discovered , that can do me good ? <EOS>
<SOS> the advancement of your children , gentle lady . <EOS>
<SOS> up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads . <EOS>
<SOS> unto the dignity and height of fortune , the high imperial type of this earth ’ s glory . <EOS>
<SOS> and thou unfit for any place but hell . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it . <EOS>
<SOS> some dungeon . <EOS>
<SOS> your bedchamber . <EOS>
<SOS> ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest ! <EOS>
<SOS> so will it , madam till i lie with you . <EOS>
<SOS> be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness ' date . <EOS>
<SOS> then know that from my soul i love thy daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> my daughter ’ s mother thinks it with her soul . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think ? <EOS>
<SOS> that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul . <EOS>
<SOS> be not so hasty to confound my meaning . <EOS>
<SOS> even he that makes her queen . <EOS>
<SOS> who else should be ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> how think you of it ? <EOS>
<SOS> how canst thou woo her ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , with all my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> you mock me , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> this is not the way to win your daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> there is no other way , unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be propn , that hath done all this . <EOS>
<SOS> say that i did all this for love of her . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , then indeed she can not choose but hate thee , having bought love with such a bloody spoil . <EOS>
<SOS> look what is done can not be now amended . <EOS>
<SOS> men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , which after - hours give leisure to repent . <EOS>
<SOS> if i did take the kingdom from your sons , to make amends i ’ ll give it to your daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> if i have killed the issue of your womb , to quicken your increase i will beget propn issue of your blood upon your daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> a grandam ’ s name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother . <EOS>
<SOS> your children were vexation to your youth , but mine shall be a comfort to your age . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not make you what amends i would ; therefore accept such kindness as i can . <EOS>
<SOS> what , we have many goodly days to see ! <EOS>
<SOS> go then , my mother ; to thy daughter go . <EOS>
<SOS> what were i best to say ? <EOS>
<SOS> her father ’ s brother would be her lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> or shall i say her uncle ? <EOS>
<SOS> or he that slew her brothers and her uncles ? <EOS>
<SOS> under what title shall i woo for thee , that propn , the law , my honor and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years ? <EOS>
<SOS> infer fair propn ’ s peace by this alliance . <EOS>
<SOS> which she shall purchase with still - lasting war . <EOS>
<SOS> tell her the king , that may command , entreats— that , at her hands , which the king ’ s propn forbids . <EOS>
<SOS> say she shall be a high and mighty queen . <EOS>
<SOS> to vail the title , as her mother doth . <EOS>
<SOS> say i will love her everlastingly . <EOS>
<SOS> but how long shall that title “ ever ” last ? <EOS>
<SOS> sweetly in force unto her fair life ’ s end . <EOS>
<SOS> but how long fairly shall her sweet life last ? <EOS>
<SOS> as long as heaven and nature lengthens it . <EOS>
<SOS> as long as hell and propn likes of it . <EOS>
<SOS> say i , her sovereign , am her subject low . <EOS>
<SOS> but she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty . <EOS>
<SOS> be eloquent in my behalf to her . <EOS>
<SOS> an honest tale speeds best being plainly told . <EOS>
<SOS> then plainly to her tell my loving tale . <EOS>
<SOS> plain and not honest is too harsh a style . <EOS>
<SOS> your reasons are too shallow and too quick . <EOS>
<SOS> o no , my reasons are too deep and dead— too deep and dead , poor infants , in their graves . <EOS>
<SOS> harp not on that string , madam ; that is past . <EOS>
<SOS> harp on it still shall i till heart - strings break . <EOS>
<SOS> now by my propn , my propn , and my crown— profaned , dishonored , and the third usurped . <EOS>
<SOS> i swear— by nothing , for this is no oath . <EOS>
<SOS> then , by myself— thyself is self - misused . <EOS>
<SOS> now , by the world— ' propn full of thy foul wrongs . <EOS>
<SOS> my father ’ s death— propn life hath it dishonored . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou hadst feared to break an oath by propn , propn ' imperial metal circling now thy head had graced the tender temples of my child , and both the princes had been breathing here , which now , two tender bedfellows for dust , propn broken faith hath made the prey for worms . <EOS>
<SOS> what canst thou swear by now ? <EOS>
<SOS> the time to come . <EOS>
<SOS> the children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered , ungoverned youth , to wail it in their age ; the parents live whose children thou hast butchered , old barren plants , to wail it with their age . <EOS>
<SOS> swear not by time to come , for that thou hast propn ere used , by times ill - used o'erpast . <EOS>
<SOS> as i intend to prosper and repent , so thrive i in my dangerous affairs of hostile arms ! <EOS>
<SOS> myself myself confound , propn and fortune bar me happy hours , propn , yield me not thy light , nor night thy rest , be opposite all planets of good luck to my proceedings if , with dear heart ’ s love , propn devotion , holy thoughts , i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> in her consists my happiness and thine . <EOS>
<SOS> urge the necessity and state of times , and be not peevish found in great designs . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i be tempted of the devil thus ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , if the devil tempt you to do good . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , if your self ’ s remembrance wrong yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> yet thou didst kill my children . <EOS>
<SOS> but in your daughter ’ s womb i bury them , where , in that nest of spicery , they will breed selves of themselves , to your recomforture . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i go win my daughter to thy will ? <EOS>
<SOS> and be a happy mother by the deed . <EOS>
<SOS> i go . <EOS>
<SOS> write to me very shortly , and you shall understand from me her mind . <EOS>
<SOS> to our shores throng many doubtful hollow - hearted friends , unarmed and unresolved to beat them back . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thought that propn is their admiral ; and there they hull , expecting but the aid of propn to welcome them ashore . <EOS>
<SOS> some light - foot friend post to the duke of propn propn , thyself , or propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , fly to the duke . <EOS>
<SOS> i will , my lord , with all convenient haste . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , come hither . <EOS>
<SOS> post to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> o true , good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> bid him levy straight the greatest strength and power that he can make and meet me suddenly at propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i go . <EOS>
<SOS> what , may it please you , shall i do at propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , what wouldst thou do there before i go ? <EOS>
<SOS> your propn told me i should post before . <EOS>
<SOS> my mind is changed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , what news with you ? <EOS>
<SOS> none good , my liege , to please you with the hearing , nor none so bad but well may be reported . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , a riddle ! <EOS>
<SOS> neither good nor bad . <EOS>
<SOS> what propn thou run so many mile about when thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way ? <EOS>
<SOS> once more , what news ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn is on the seas . <EOS>
<SOS> there let him sink , and be the seas on him ! <EOS>
<SOS> white - livered runagate , what doth he there ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , as you guess ? <EOS>
<SOS> stirred up by propn , propn , and propn , he makes for propn , here to claim the crown . <EOS>
<SOS> it is my day , my life . <EOS>
<SOS> black night o'ershade thy day , and death thy life . <EOS>
<SOS> curse not thyself , fair creature ; thou art both . <EOS>
<SOS> i would i were , to be revenged on thee . <EOS>
<SOS> his better doth not breathe upon the earth . <EOS>
<SOS> is the chair empty ? <EOS>
<SOS> is the sword unswayed ? <EOS>
<SOS> is the king dead , the empire unpossessed ? <EOS>
<SOS> what heir of propn is there alive but we ? <EOS>
<SOS> and who is propn ’ s king but great propn ’ s heir ? <EOS>
<SOS> then tell me , what makes he upon the seas ? <EOS>
<SOS> where is thy power , then , to beat him back ? <EOS>
<SOS> where be thy tenants and thy followers ? <EOS>
<SOS> are they not now upon the western shore , propn - conducting the rebels from their ships ? <EOS>
<SOS> cold friends to me . <EOS>
<SOS> what do they in the north when they should serve their sovereign in the west ? <EOS>
<SOS> they have not been commanded , mighty king . <EOS>
<SOS> propn your propn to give me leave , i ’ ll muster up my friends and meet your grace where and what time your propn shall please . <EOS>
<SOS> most mighty sovereign , you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful . <EOS>
<SOS> i never was nor never will be false . <EOS>
<SOS> go then and muster men , but leave behind your son propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my gracious sovereign , now in propn , as i by friends am well advertisèd , propn propn propn and the haughty prelate , propn of propn , his elder brother , with many more confederates are in arms . <EOS>
<SOS> in propn , my liege , the propn are in arms , and every hour more competitors propn to the rebels , and their power grows strong . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , the army of great propn out on you , owls ! <EOS>
<SOS> nothing but songs of death . <EOS>
<SOS> but this good comfort bring i to your highness : the propn navy is dispersed by tempest . <EOS>
<SOS> propn on , march on , since we are up in arms , if not to fight with foreign enemies , yet to beat down these rebels here at home . <EOS>
<SOS> while we reason here , a royal battle might be won and lost . <EOS>
<SOS> someone take order propn be brought to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the rest march on with me . <EOS>
<SOS> but , tell me , where is princely propn now ? <EOS>
<SOS> at propn , or at propn in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn propn , a renownèd soldier ; propn propn propn , propn propn propn , propn , redoubted propn , propn propn propn , and propn ap propn , with a valiant crew , and many other of great name and worth ; and towards propn they do bend their power , if by the way they be not fought withal . <EOS>
<SOS> now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of propn , and all the clouds that loured upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried . <EOS>
<SOS> propn - visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front ; and now , instead of mounting barbèd steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries , he capers nimbly in a lady ’ s chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute . <EOS>
<SOS> will not propn propn let me speak with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , my good lord . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore be patient . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and propn ’ s children , propn and propn , propn propn propn and thy fair son propn , propn , and all that have miscarrièd by underhand , corrupted , foul injustice , if that your moody , discontented souls do through the clouds behold this present hour , even for revenge mock my destruction.— this is all propn ' day , fellow , is it not ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is . <EOS>
<SOS> why , then all propn ' day is my body ’ s doomsday . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the day which , in propn propn ’ s time , i wished might fall on me when i was found false to his children and his wife ’ s allies . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the day wherein i wished to fall by the false faith of him who most i trusted . <EOS>
<SOS> this , this all propn ' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs . <EOS>
<SOS> that high all - seer which i dallied with propn turned my feignèd prayer on my head and given in earnest what i begged in jest . <EOS>
<SOS> thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points in their masters ' bosoms . <EOS>
<SOS> wrong hath but wrong , and blame the due of blame . <EOS>
<SOS> i doubt not but his friends will turn to us . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath no friends but who are friends for fear . <EOS>
<SOS> which in his dearest need will fly from him . <EOS>
<SOS> all for our vantage . <EOS>
<SOS> then , in propn ’ s name , march . <EOS>
<SOS> true hope is swift , and flies with swallow ’ s wings . <EOS>
<SOS> kings it makes gods , and meaner creatures kings . <EOS>
<SOS> my heart is ten times lighter than my looks . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn of propn here , most gracious liege . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , we must have knocks , ha , must we not ? <EOS>
<SOS> we must both give and take , my loving lord . <EOS>
<SOS> up with my tent ! —here will i lie tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> but where tomorrow ? <EOS>
<SOS> well , all ’ s one for that . <EOS>
<SOS> six or seven thousand is their utmost power . <EOS>
<SOS> why , our battalia trebles that account . <EOS>
<SOS> besides , the king ’ s name is a tower of strength which they upon the adverse party want . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s lack no discipline , make no delay , for , lords , tomorrow is a busy day . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn of propn , you , propn propn propn , and you , propn propn propn , stay with me . <EOS>
<SOS> the earl of propn keeps his regiment— propn propn propn , bear my goodnight to him , and by the second hour in the morning propn the earl to see me in my tent . <EOS>
<SOS> unless i have mista'en his colors much , which well i am assured i have not done , his regiment lies half a mile , at least , propn from the mighty power of the king . <EOS>
<SOS> if without peril it be possible , propn propn , make some good means to speak with him , and give him from me this most needful note . <EOS>
<SOS> upon my life , my lord , i ’ ll undertake it . <EOS>
<SOS> he lives that loves thee better than he could . <EOS>
<SOS> name him . <EOS>
<SOS> plantagenet . <EOS>
<SOS> why , that was he . <EOS>
<SOS> the selfsame name , but one of better nature . <EOS>
<SOS> where is he ? <EOS>
<SOS> here . <EOS>
<SOS> why dost thou spit at me ? <EOS>
<SOS> would it were mortal poison for thy sake . <EOS>
<SOS> never came poison from so sweet a place . <EOS>
<SOS> never hung poison on a fouler toad . <EOS>
<SOS> out of my sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou dost infect mine eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> thine eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine . <EOS>
<SOS> would they were basilisks to strike thee dead . <EOS>
<SOS> good night , good propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> come , gentlemen , let us consult upon tomorrow ’ s business into my tent . <EOS>
<SOS> the dew is raw and cold . <EOS>
<SOS> what is “ t o ” clock ? <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s suppertime , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> it ’ s nine o'clock . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not sup tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> give me some ink and paper . <EOS>
<SOS> what , is my beaver easier than it was ? <EOS>
<SOS> and all my armor laid into my tent ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , hie thee to thy charge . <EOS>
<SOS> i go , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> stir with the lark tomorrow , gentle propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i warrant you , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou the melancholy propn propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn the earl of propn and himself , much about cockshut time , from troop to troop went through the army cheering up the soldiers . <EOS>
<SOS> so , i am satisfied . <EOS>
<SOS> set it down . <EOS>
<SOS> is ink and paper ready ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , about the mid of night come to my tent and help to arm me . <EOS>
<SOS> leave me , i say . <EOS>
<SOS> fortune and victory sit on thy helm ! <EOS>
<SOS> all comfort that the dark night can afford be to thy person , noble father - in - law . <EOS>
<SOS> tell me , how fares our loving mother ? <EOS>
<SOS> i , by attorney , bless thee from thy mother , who prays continually for propn ’ s good . <EOS>
<SOS> in brief , for so the season bids us be , prepare thy battle early in the morning , and put thy fortune to the arbitrament of bloody strokes and mortal - staring war . <EOS>
<SOS> i , as i may — that which i would i can not , — with best advantage will deceive the time , and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms . <EOS>
<SOS> but on thy side i may not be too forward , propn , being seen , thy brother , tender propn , be executed in his father ’ s sight . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the leisure and the fearful time cuts off the ceremonious vows of love and ample interchange of sweet discourse , which so - long - sundered friends should dwell upon . <EOS>
<SOS> propn give us leisure for these rites of love ! <EOS>
<SOS> once more , adieu . <EOS>
<SOS> be valiant , and speed well . <EOS>
<SOS> once more , good night , kind lords and gentlemen . <EOS>
<SOS> o thou , whose captain i account myself , look on my forces with a gracious eye . <EOS>
<SOS> make us thy ministers of chastisement , that we may praise thee in the victory ! <EOS>
<SOS> to thee i do commend my watchful soul , propn i let fall the windows of mine eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> sleeping and waking , o , defend me still ! <EOS>
<SOS> think upon propn , and with guilty fear let fall thy lance . <EOS>
<SOS> despair , and die ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish . <EOS>
<SOS> think on propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> despair and die ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn adversary ’ s wife doth pray for thee . <EOS>
<SOS> the last was i that felt thy tyranny . <EOS>
<SOS> o , in the battle think on propn , and die in terror of thy guiltiness . <EOS>
<SOS> dream on , dream on , of bloody deeds and death . <EOS>
<SOS> but cheer thy heart , and be thou not dismayed . <EOS>
<SOS> give me another horse ! <EOS>
<SOS> bind up my wounds ! <EOS>
<SOS> have mercy , propn , i did but dream . <EOS>
<SOS> o coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me ! <EOS>
<SOS> what do i fear ? <EOS>
<SOS> myself ? <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s none else by . <EOS>
<SOS> propn loves propn ; that is , i and i . <EOS>
<SOS> is there a murderer here ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , i am . <EOS>
<SOS> then fly ! <EOS>
<SOS> what , from myself ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i love myself . <EOS>
<SOS> wherefore ? <EOS>
<SOS> for any good that i myself have done unto myself ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , no ! <EOS>
<SOS> alas , i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself . <EOS>
<SOS> i am a villain . <EOS>
<SOS> fool , of thyself speak well . <EOS>
<SOS> fool , do not flatter . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> zounds , who is there ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord , ’ tis i . <EOS>
<SOS> the early village cock propn twice done salutation to the morn . <EOS>
<SOS> your friends are up and buckle on their armor . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , i have dreamed a fearful dream ! <EOS>
<SOS> what think ’ st thou , will our friends prove all true ? <EOS>
<SOS> no doubt , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> by the apostle propn , shadows tonight have struck more terror to the soul of propn than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers propn in proof and led by shallow propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn not yet near day . <EOS>
<SOS> come , go with me ; under our tents i ’ ll play the eavesdropper to see if any mean to shrink from me . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here . <EOS>
<SOS> how have you slept , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> the sweetest sleep and fairest - boding dreams that ever entered in a drowsy head have i since your departure had , my lords . <EOS>
<SOS> methought their souls whose bodies propn murdered propn to my tent and cried on victory . <EOS>
<SOS> i promise you , my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream . <EOS>
<SOS> how far into the morning is it , lords ? <EOS>
<SOS> upon the stroke of four . <EOS>
<SOS> why , then ’ tis time to arm and give direction . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and our good cause fight upon our side . <EOS>
<SOS> the prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls , like high - reared bulwarks , stand before our faces . <EOS>
<SOS> propn except , those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow . <EOS>
<SOS> for what is he they follow ? <EOS>
<SOS> if you do sweat to put a tyrant down , you sleep in peace , the tyrant being slain . <EOS>
<SOS> if you do fight against your country ’ s foes , your country ’ s fat shall pay your pains the hire . <EOS>
<SOS> if you do fight in safeguard of your wives , your wives shall welcome home the conquerors . <EOS>
<SOS> if you do free your children from the sword , your children ’ s children quits it in your age . <EOS>
<SOS> then , in the name of propn and all these rights , advance your standards . <EOS>
<SOS> i would they were , that i might die at once , for now they kill me with a living death . <EOS>
<SOS> i never sued to friend , nor enemy ; my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word . <EOS>
<SOS> if thy revengeful heart can not forgive , propn , here i lend thee this sharp - pointed sword , which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee , i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , do not pause ; for i did kill propn propn but ’ twas thy beauty that provokèd me . <EOS>
<SOS> what said propn as touching propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> that he was never trainèd up in arms . <EOS>
<SOS> he said the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> and what said propn then ? <EOS>
<SOS> he smiled and said “ the better for our purpose . ” he was in the right , and so indeed it is . <EOS>
<SOS> tell the clock there . <EOS>
<SOS> give me a calendar . <EOS>
<SOS> not i , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> the sun will not be seen today . <EOS>
<SOS> the sky doth frown and lour upon our army . <EOS>
<SOS> i would these dewy tears were from the ground . <EOS>
<SOS> not shine today ? <EOS>
<SOS> arm , arm , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> the foe vaunts in the field . <EOS>
<SOS> come , bustle , bustle . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn of propn , propn propn of propn , propn have the leading of this foot and horse . <EOS>
<SOS> they thus directed , we will follow in the main battle , whose puissance on either side shall be well wingèd with our chiefest horse . <EOS>
<SOS> this , and propn propn to boot — what think ’ st thou , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> a good direction , warlike sovereign . <EOS>
<SOS> this found i on my tent this morning . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> i hear their drum . <EOS>
<SOS> amaze the welkin with your broken staves— <EOS>
<SOS> what says propn propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> will he bring his power ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , he doth deny to come . <EOS>
<SOS> off with his son propn ’ s head ! <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , the enemy is past the marsh . <EOS>
<SOS> after the battle let propn propn die . <EOS>
<SOS> upon them ! <EOS>
<SOS> victory sits on our helms . <EOS>
<SOS> rescue , my lord of propn , rescue , rescue ! <EOS>
<SOS> the king enacts more wonders than a man , daring an opposite to every danger . <EOS>
<SOS> his horse is slain , and all on foot he fights , seeking for propn in the throat of death . <EOS>
<SOS> rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost ! <EOS>
<SOS> a horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse ! <EOS>
<SOS> withdraw , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll help you to a horse . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and your arms be praised , victorious friends ! <EOS>
<SOS> great propn of propn , say amen to all ! <EOS>
<SOS> but tell me , is young propn propn living ? <EOS>
<SOS> he is , my lord , and safe in propn town , propn , if it please you , we may now withdraw us . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn of propn , propn , propn propn , propn propn propn , and propn propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> and then , as we have ta'en the sacrament , we will unite the white rose and the red . <EOS>
<SOS> smile propn upon this fair conjunction , that long have frowned upon their enmity . <EOS>
<SOS> what traitor hears me and says not “ amen ? ” propn hath long been mad and scarred herself . <EOS>
<SOS> o , now let propn and propn , the true succeeders of each royal house , by propn ’ s fair ordinance conjoin together , and let their heirs , propn , if thy will be so . <EOS>
<SOS> abate the edge of traitors , gracious propn , that would reduce these bloody days again , and make poor propn weep in streams of blood ! <EOS>
<SOS> let them not live to taste this land ’ s increase , that would with treason wound this fair land ’ s peace . <EOS>
<SOS> now civil wounds are stopped , peace lives again . <EOS>
<SOS> that she may long live here , propn say amen . <EOS>
<SOS> take up the sword again , or take up me . <EOS>
<SOS> arise , dissembler . <EOS>
<SOS> though i wish thy death , i will not be the executioner . <EOS>
<SOS> i have already . <EOS>
<SOS> that was in thy rage . <EOS>
<SOS> speak it again and , even with the word , this hand , which for thy love did kill thy love , propn for thy love kill a far truer love . <EOS>
<SOS> to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory . <EOS>
<SOS> i would i knew thy heart . <EOS>
<SOS> propn figured in my tongue . <EOS>
<SOS> i fear me both are false . <EOS>
<SOS> then never man was man true . <EOS>
<SOS> well , well , put up your sword . <EOS>
<SOS> say then my peace is made . <EOS>
<SOS> that shall you know hereafter . <EOS>
<SOS> but shall i live in hope ? <EOS>
<SOS> all men i hope live so . <EOS>
<SOS> propn to wear this ring . <EOS>
<SOS> wear both of them , for both of them are thine . <EOS>
<SOS> and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand , propn dost confirm his happiness forever . <EOS>
<SOS> what is it ? <EOS>
<SOS> that it would please you leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner , and presently repair to propn propn , where , after i have solemnly interred at propn propn this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears , i will with all expedient duty see you . <EOS>
<SOS> for divers unknown reasons , i beseech you , grant me this boon . <EOS>
<SOS> with all my heart , and much it joys me too to see you are become so propn propn and propn , go along with me . <EOS>
<SOS> bid me farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> sirs , take up the corse . <EOS>
<SOS> towards propn , noble lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> there attend my coming . <EOS>
<SOS> was ever woman in this humor wooed ? <EOS>
<SOS> was ever woman in this humor won ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll have her , but i will not keep her long . <EOS>
<SOS> and yet to win her , all the world to nothing ! <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn she forgot already that brave prince , propn , her lord , whom i some three months since propn in my angry mood at propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> a sweeter and a propn gentleman , framed in the prodigality of nature , young , valiant , wise , and , no doubt , right royal , the spacious world can not again afford . <EOS>
<SOS> and will she yet abase her eyes on me , that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed ? <EOS>
<SOS> on me , whose all not equals propn ’ s moiety ? <EOS>
<SOS> on me , that halts and am misshapen thus ? <EOS>
<SOS> my dukedom to a beggarly denier , i do mistake my person all this while ! <EOS>
<SOS> upon my life , she finds , although i can not , myself to be a marv'lous proper man . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body . <EOS>
<SOS> since i am crept in favor with myself , i will maintain it with some little cost . <EOS>
<SOS> but first i ’ ll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love . <EOS>
<SOS> shine out , fair sun , till i have bought a glass , that i may see my shadow as i pass . <EOS>
<SOS> have patience , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s no doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustomed health . <EOS>
<SOS> if he were dead , what would betide on me ? <EOS>
<SOS> ah , he is young , and his minority is put unto the trust of propn propn , a man that loves not me nor none of you . <EOS>
<SOS> is it concluded that he shall be propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> it is determined , not concluded yet ; but so it must be if the king miscarry . <EOS>
<SOS> propn make your propn joyful , as you have been . <EOS>
<SOS> saw you the king today , my lord of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> but now the duke of propn and i are come from visiting his majesty . <EOS>
<SOS> what likelihood of his amendment , lords ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , good hope . <EOS>
<SOS> his grace speaks cheerfully . <EOS>
<SOS> propn grant him health . <EOS>
<SOS> did you confer with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> would all were well — but that will never be . <EOS>
<SOS> they do me wrong , and i will not endure it ! <EOS>
<SOS> who is it that complains unto the king that i , forsooth , am stern and love them not ? <EOS>
<SOS> can not a plain man live and think no harm , but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken , sly , insinuating jacks ? <EOS>
<SOS> to whom in all this presence speaks your grace ? <EOS>
<SOS> to thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace . <EOS>
<SOS> when have i injured thee ? <EOS>
<SOS> or any of your faction ? <EOS>
<SOS> a plague upon you all ! <EOS>
<SOS> his royal grace , whom propn preserve better than you would wish , can not be quiet scarce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints . <EOS>
<SOS> brother of propn , you mistake the matter . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not tell . <EOS>
<SOS> the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come , we know your meaning , brother propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you envy my advancement , and my friends ' . <EOS>
<SOS> propn grant we never may have need of you . <EOS>
<SOS> meantime propn grants that we have need of you . <EOS>
<SOS> our brother is imprisoned by your means , myself disgraced , and the nobility held in contempt , while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble . <EOS>
<SOS> by propn that raised me to this careful height from that contented hap which i enjoyed , i never did incense his majesty against the duke of propn , but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him . <EOS>
<SOS> and therefore , since i can not prove a lover to entertain these fair well - spoken days , i am determinèd to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days . <EOS>
<SOS> plots have i laid , inductions dangerous , by drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , to set my brother propn and the king in deadly hate , the one against the other ; and if propn propn be as true and just as i am subtle , false , and treacherous , this day should propn closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that “ g ” of propn ’ s heirs the murderer shall be . <EOS>
<SOS> his majesty , tend'ring my person ’ s safety , hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> upon what cause ? <EOS>
<SOS> because my name is propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , my lord , that fault is none of yours . <EOS>
<SOS> he should , for that , commit your godfathers . <EOS>
<SOS> o , belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be new christened in the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but what ’ s the matter , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> may i know ? <EOS>
<SOS> what may she not ? <EOS>
<SOS> i wis , your grandam had a worser match . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn of propn , i have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs . <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts that oft i have endured . <EOS>
<SOS> i had rather be a country servant - maid than a great queen with this condition , to be so baited , scorned , and stormèd at . <EOS>
<SOS> small joy have i in being propn ’ s queen . <EOS>
<SOS> so should we you , if you should be our king . <EOS>
<SOS> if i should be ? <EOS>
<SOS> i had rather be a peddler . <EOS>
<SOS> hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out in sharing that which you have pilled from me ! <EOS>
<SOS> which of you trembles not that looks on me ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , wrinkled witch , what propn thou in my sight ? <EOS>
<SOS> but repetition of what thou hast marred . <EOS>
<SOS> that will i make before i let thee go . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou not banishèd on pain of death ? <EOS>
<SOS> i was , but i do find more pain in banishment than death can yield me here by my abode . <EOS>
<SOS> the sorrow that i have by right is yours , and all the pleasures you usurp are mine . <EOS>
<SOS> o , ’ twas the foulest deed to slay that babe , and the most merciless that e'er was heard of ! <EOS>
<SOS> tyrants themselves wept when it was reported . <EOS>
<SOS> what , were you snarling all before i came , ready to catch each other by the throat , and turn you all your hatred now on me ? <EOS>
<SOS> thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , outlive thy glory , like my wretched self . <EOS>
<SOS> have done thy charm , thou hateful , withered hag . <EOS>
<SOS> and leave out thee ? <EOS>
<SOS> stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me . <EOS>
<SOS> the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> ha ? <EOS>
<SOS> i call thee not . <EOS>
<SOS> i cry thee mercy , then , for i did think that thou hadst called me all these bitter names . <EOS>
<SOS> why , so i did , but looked for no reply . <EOS>
<SOS> o , let me make the period to my curse ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn done by me , and ends in “ propn . ” thus have you breathed your curse against yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> poor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune , why strew ’ st thou sugar on that bottled spider , whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ? <EOS>
<SOS> the day will come that thou shalt wish for me to help thee curse that poisonous bunch - backed toad . <EOS>
<SOS> false - boding woman , end thy frantic curse , propn to thy harm thou move our patience . <EOS>
<SOS> propn shame upon you , you have all moved mine . <EOS>
<SOS> were you well served , you would be taught your duty . <EOS>
<SOS> to serve me well , you all should do me duty : teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects . <EOS>
<SOS> o , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty ! <EOS>
<SOS> they that stand high have many blasts to shake them , and if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces . <EOS>
<SOS> good counsel , marry . <EOS>
<SOS> learn it , learn it , marquess . <EOS>
<SOS> it touches you , my lord , as much as me . <EOS>
<SOS> and turns the sun to shade . <EOS>
<SOS> urge neither charity nor shame to me . <EOS>
<SOS> uncharitably with me have you dealt , and shamefully my hopes by you are butchered . <EOS>
<SOS> my charity is outrage , life my shame , and in that shame still live my sorrows ' rage . <EOS>
<SOS> have done , have done . <EOS>
<SOS> thy garments are not spotted with our blood , nor thou within the compass of my curse . <EOS>
<SOS> nor no one here , for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air . <EOS>
<SOS> what doth she say , my lord of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing that i respect , my gracious lord . <EOS>
<SOS> what , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel , and soothe the devil that i warn thee from ? <EOS>
<SOS> my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses . <EOS>
<SOS> and so doth mine . <EOS>
<SOS> i muse why she ’ s at liberty . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not blame her . <EOS>
<SOS> i never did her any , to my knowledge . <EOS>
<SOS> yet you have all the vantage of her wrong . <EOS>
<SOS> marry , as for propn , he is well repaid ; he is franked up to fatting for his pains . <EOS>
<SOS> propn pardon them that are the cause thereof . <EOS>
<SOS> so do i ever propn had i cursed now , i had cursed myself . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , propn , when i know , for i protest as yet i do not . <EOS>
<SOS> but , as i can learn , he hearkens after prophecies and dreams , and from the crossrow plucks the letter and says a wizard told him that by “ g ” his issue disinherited should be . <EOS>
<SOS> and for my name of propn begins with it follows in his thought that i am he . <EOS>
<SOS> why , this it is when men are ruled by women . <EOS>
<SOS> propn not the king that sends you to the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn propn his wife , propn , ’ tis she that tempers him to this extremity . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , his majesty doth call for you , — and for your grace , —and yours , my gracious lords . <EOS>
<SOS> we wait upon your grace . <EOS>
<SOS> i do the wrong , and first begin to brawl . <EOS>
<SOS> now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on propn , propn , propn ; but then i sigh and , with a piece of scripture , tell them that propn bids us do good for evil ; and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stolen out of propn propn , and seem a saint when most i play the devil . <EOS>
<SOS> but , soft ! <EOS>
<SOS> are you now going to dispatch this thing ? <EOS>
<SOS> we are , my lord , and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is . <EOS>
<SOS> well thought upon . <EOS>
<SOS> i have it here about me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , tut , my lord , we will not stand to prate . <EOS>
<SOS> talkers are no good doers . <EOS>
<SOS> be assured we go to use our hands and not our tongues . <EOS>
<SOS> your eyes drop millstones , when fools ' eyes drop tears . <EOS>
<SOS> i like you lads . <EOS>
<SOS> go , go , dispatch . <EOS>
<SOS> we will , my noble lord . <EOS>
<SOS> why looks your grace so heavily today ? <EOS>
<SOS> what was your dream , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you tell me . <EOS>
<SOS> methoughts that i had broken from the propn and was embarked to cross to propn , and in my company my brother propn , who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches . <EOS>
<SOS> thence we looked toward propn and cited up a thousand fearful times , during the wars of propn and propn that had befall'n us . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , methought what pain it was to drown , what dreadful noise of waters in my ears , what sights of ugly death within my eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wracks , a thousand men that fishes gnawed upon , propn of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , inestimable stones , unvalued jewels , all scattered in the bottom of the sea . <EOS>
<SOS> had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep ? <EOS>
<SOS> methought i had , and often did i strive to yield the ghost , but still the envious flood stopped in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty , vast , and wand'ring air , but smothered it within my panting bulk , who almost burst to belch it in the sea . <EOS>
<SOS> i passed , methought , the melancholy flood , with that sour ferryman which poets write of , unto the kingdom of perpetual night . <EOS>
<SOS> the first that there did greet my stranger - soul was my great father - in - law , renownèd propn , who spake aloud , “ what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false propn ? ” and so he vanished . <EOS>
<SOS> no marvel , lord , though it affrighted you . <EOS>
<SOS> i am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it . <EOS>
<SOS> ah keeper , keeper , i have done those things , that now give evidence against my soul , for propn ’ s sake , and see how he requites me.— o propn , if my deep prayers can not appease thee , but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , yet execute thy wrath in me alone ! <EOS>
<SOS> o , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children ! — propn , i prithee sit by me awhile . <EOS>
<SOS> my soul is heavy , and i fain would sleep . <EOS>
<SOS> i will , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn give your grace good rest . <EOS>
<SOS> sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , makes the night morning , and the noontide night . <EOS>
<SOS> princes have but their titles for their glories , an outward honor for an inward toil , <EOS>
<SOS> what wouldst thou , fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> and how propn thou hither ? <EOS>
<SOS> i would speak with propn , and i came hither on my legs . <EOS>
<SOS> what , so brief ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn better , sir , to be brief than tedious .— let him see our commission , and talk no more . <EOS>
<SOS> i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of propn to your hands . <EOS>
<SOS> there lies the duke asleep , and there the keys . <EOS>
<SOS> you may , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a point of wisdom . <EOS>
<SOS> fare you well . <EOS>
<SOS> what , shall i stab him as he sleeps ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ ll say ’ twas done cowardly , when he wakes . <EOS>
<SOS> why , he shall never wake until the great propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> why , then he ’ ll say we stabbed him sleeping . <EOS>
<SOS> the urging of that word “ judgment ” hath bred a kind of remorse in me . <EOS>
<SOS> what , art thou afraid ? <EOS>
<SOS> not to kill him , having a warrant , but to be damned for killing him , from the which no warrant can defend me . <EOS>
<SOS> i thought thou hadst been resolute . <EOS>
<SOS> so i am — to let him live . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll back to the duke of propn and tell him so . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , i prithee stay a little . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope this passionate humor of mine will change . <EOS>
<SOS> it was wo nt to hold me but while one tells twenty . <EOS>
<SOS> how dost thou feel thyself now ? <EOS>
<SOS> faith , some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me . <EOS>
<SOS> remember our reward when the deed ’ s done . <EOS>
<SOS> zounds , he dies ! <EOS>
<SOS> i had forgot the reward . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s thy conscience now ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , in the duke of propn ’ s purse . <EOS>
<SOS> so when he opens his purse to give us our reward , thy conscience flies out . <EOS>
<SOS> propn no matter . <EOS>
<SOS> let it go . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s few or none will entertain it . <EOS>
<SOS> what if it come to thee again ? <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll not meddle with it . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a blushing , shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man ’ s bosom . <EOS>
<SOS> i am strong - framed . <EOS>
<SOS> he can not prevail with me . <EOS>
<SOS> spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation . <EOS>
<SOS> come , shall we fall to work ? <EOS>
<SOS> take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room . <EOS>
<SOS> o excellent device— and make a sop of him . <EOS>
<SOS> strike ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , we ’ ll reason with him . <EOS>
<SOS> where art thou , keeper ? <EOS>
<SOS> give me a cup of wine . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall have wine enough , my lord , anon . <EOS>
<SOS> in propn ’ s name , what art thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> a man , as you are . <EOS>
<SOS> but not , as i am , royal . <EOS>
<SOS> nor you , as we are , loyal . <EOS>
<SOS> thy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble . <EOS>
<SOS> my voice is now the king propn , my looks mine own . <EOS>
<SOS> your eyes do menace me . <EOS>
<SOS> why look you pale ? <EOS>
<SOS> who sent you hither ? <EOS>
<SOS> wherefore do you come ? <EOS>
<SOS> to , to , propn to murder me ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , ay . <EOS>
<SOS> you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so , and therefore can not have the hearts to do it . <EOS>
<SOS> wherein , my friends , have i offended you ? <EOS>
<SOS> offended us you have not , but the king . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall be reconciled to him again . <EOS>
<SOS> never , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore prepare to die . <EOS>
<SOS> are you drawn forth among a world of men to slay the innocent ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is my offense ? <EOS>
<SOS> where is the evidence that doth accuse me ? <EOS>
<SOS> what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge ? <EOS>
<SOS> or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor propn ' death before i be convict by course of law ? <EOS>
<SOS> to threaten me with death is most unlawful . <EOS>
<SOS> i charge you , as you hope to have redemption , by propn ’ s dear blood shed for our grievous sins , that you depart , and lay no hands on me . <EOS>
<SOS> what we will do , we do upon command . <EOS>
<SOS> even so . <EOS>
<SOS> an please your worship , propn , you may partake of anything we say . <EOS>
<SOS> we speak no treason , man . <EOS>
<SOS> we say the king is wise and virtuous , and his noble queen well struck in years , fair , and not jealous . <EOS>
<SOS> we say that propn ’ s wife hath a pretty foot , a cherry lip , a bonny eye , a passing pleasing tongue , and that the queen ’ s kindred are made gentlefolks . <EOS>
<SOS> how say you , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> can you deny all this ? <EOS>
<SOS> with this , my lord , myself have naught to do . <EOS>
<SOS> her husband , knave . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou betray me ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do beseech your grace to pardon me , and withal propn your conference with the noble duke . <EOS>
<SOS> and he that hath commanded is our king . <EOS>
<SOS> and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too . <EOS>
<SOS> whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend . <EOS>
<SOS> how canst thou urge propn ’ s dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in such dear degree ? <EOS>
<SOS> for whose sake did i that ill deed ? <EOS>
<SOS> for propn , for my brother , for his sake . <EOS>
<SOS> if propn will be avengèd for this deed , o , know you yet he doth it publicly ! <EOS>
<SOS> take not the quarrel from his powerful arm ; he needs no indirect or lawless course to cut off those that have offended him . <EOS>
<SOS> my brother ’ s love , the devil , and my rage . <EOS>
<SOS> i am his brother , and i love him well . <EOS>
<SOS> you are deceived . <EOS>
<SOS> your brother propn hates you . <EOS>
<SOS> o , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear . <EOS>
<SOS> go you to him from me . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , so we will . <EOS>
<SOS> tell him , when that our princely father propn blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , he little thought of this divided friendship . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn think of this , and he will weep . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep . <EOS>
<SOS> right , as snow in harvest . <EOS>
<SOS> come , you deceive yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> propn he that sends us to destroy you here . <EOS>
<SOS> why , so he doth , when he delivers you from this earth ’ s thralldom to the joys of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> make peace with propn , for you must die , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> have you that holy feeling in your souls to counsel me to make my peace with propn , and art you yet to your own souls so blind that thou will war with propn by murd'ring me ? <EOS>
<SOS> o sirs , consider : they that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , and save your souls . <EOS>
<SOS> which of you — if you were a prince ’ s son being pent from liberty , as i am now— if two such murderers as yourselves came to you , would not entreat for life ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , you would beg , were you in my distress . <EOS>
<SOS> propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> propn cowardly and womanish . <EOS>
<SOS> look behind you , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> take that , and that . <EOS>
<SOS> how now ? <EOS>
<SOS> what mean ’ st thou , that thou propn me not ? <EOS>
<SOS> by heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been . <EOS>
<SOS> i would he knew that i had saved his brother . <EOS>
<SOS> so do not i . <EOS>
<SOS> go , coward as thou art . <EOS>
<SOS> well , i ’ ll go hide the body in some hole till that the duke give order for his burial . <EOS>
<SOS> and when i have my meed , i will away , for this will out , and then i must not stay . <EOS>
