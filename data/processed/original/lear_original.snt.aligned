<SOS> weapons , arms ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s the matter here ? <EOS>
<SOS> keep peace , upon your lives . <EOS>
<SOS> he dies that strikes again . <EOS>
<SOS> what is the matter ? <EOS>
<SOS> the messengers from our sister and the king . <EOS>
<SOS> what is your difference ? <EOS>
<SOS> speak . <EOS>
<SOS> i am scarce in breath , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> a tailor made thee . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art a strange fellow . <EOS>
<SOS> a tailor make a man ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , a tailor , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> a stone - cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o ' th ' trade . <EOS>
<SOS> speak yet . <EOS>
<SOS> peace , sirrah ! <EOS>
<SOS> you beastly knave , know you no reverence ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , sir , but anger hath a privilege . <EOS>
<SOS> why art thou angry ? <EOS>
<SOS> smile you my speeches as i were a fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , art thou mad , old fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> why dost thou call him “ knave ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s his offense ? <EOS>
<SOS> his countenance likes me not . <EOS>
<SOS> no more perchance does mine , nor his , nor hers . <EOS>
<SOS> this is some fellow , who , having been praised for bluntness , doth affect a saucy roughness and constrains the garb quite from his nature . <EOS>
<SOS> he can not flatter , he . <EOS>
<SOS> an honest mind and plain , he must speak truth . <EOS>
<SOS> an they will take it , so . <EOS>
<SOS> if not , he ’ s plain . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , in good faith , or in sincere verity , under th ' allowance of your great aspect , whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire on flickering propn ' front— what mean ’ st by this ? <EOS>
<SOS> to go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much . <EOS>
<SOS> i know , sir , i am no flatterer . <EOS>
<SOS> i never gave him any . <EOS>
<SOS> none of these rogues and cowards but propn is their fool . <EOS>
<SOS> call not your stocks for me . <EOS>
<SOS> i serve the king , on whose employment i was sent to you . <EOS>
<SOS> you shall do small respect , show too bold malice against the grace and person of my master , stocking his messenger . <EOS>
<SOS> fetch forth the stocks ! <EOS>
<SOS> as i have life and honor , there shall he sit till noon . <EOS>
<SOS> till noon ? <EOS>
<SOS> till night , my lord , and all night too . <EOS>
<SOS> why , madam , if i were your father ’ s dog , you should not use me so . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , being his knave , i will . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a fellow of the selfsame color our sister speaks of .— come , bring away the stocks ! <EOS>
<SOS> let me beseech your grace not to do so . <EOS>
<SOS> his fault is much , and the good king his master will check him for propn . <EOS>
<SOS> the king his master needs must take it ill , that he , so slightly valued in his messenger , should have him thus restrained . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll answer that . <EOS>
<SOS> my sister may receive it much more worse to have her gentleman abused , assaulted for following her affairs .— put in his legs . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sorry for thee , friend . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll entreat for thee . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you do not , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> a good man ’ s fortune may grow out at heels . <EOS>
<SOS> give you good morrow . <EOS>
<SOS> the duke propn to blame in this . <EOS>
<SOS> propn be ill taken . <EOS>
<SOS> obey you , love you , and most honor you . <EOS>
<SOS> haply when i shall we d that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him , half my care and duty . <EOS>
<SOS> sure , i shall never marry like my sisters , to love my father all . <EOS>
<SOS> but goes thy heart with this ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , good my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> so young and so untender ? <EOS>
<SOS> so young , my lord , and true . <EOS>
<SOS> let it be so . <EOS>
<SOS> thy truth then be thy dower . <EOS>
<SOS> the barbarous scythian , or he that makes his generation messes to gorge his appetite , shall to my bosom be as well neighbored , pitied , and relieved as thou my sometime daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> good my liege— peace , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i heard myself proclaimed , and by the happy hollow of a tree escaped the hunt . <EOS>
<SOS> no port is free , no place that guard and most unusual vigilance does not attend my taking . <EOS>
<SOS> my face i ’ ll grime with filth , propn my loins , elf all my hair in knots , and with presented nakedness outface the winds and persecutions of the sky . <EOS>
<SOS> poor propn ! ” “ poor tom ! ” — that ’ s something yet . <EOS>
<SOS> propn i nothing am . <EOS>
<SOS> propn strange that they should so depart from home , and not send back my messenger . <EOS>
<SOS> as i learned , the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou this shame thy pastime ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> look , he wears cruel garters . <EOS>
<SOS> horses are tied by the heads , dogs and bears by the neck , monkeys by the loins , and men by the legs . <EOS>
<SOS> it is both he and she : your son and daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> yes . <EOS>
<SOS> no , no , they would not . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , they have . <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , i swear “ no . ” by propn , i swear “ ay . ” they durst not do propn . <EOS>
<SOS> they could not , would not do propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn worse than murder to do upon respect such violent outrage . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , when at their home i did commend your highness ' letters to them . <EOS>
<SOS> he raised the house with loud and coward cries . <EOS>
<SOS> your son and daughter found this trespass worth the shame which here it suffers . <EOS>
<SOS> fathers that wear rags do make their children blind . <EOS>
<SOS> but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , that arrant whore , propn turns the key to th ' poor . <EOS>
<SOS> but for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year . <EOS>
<SOS> o , how this mother swells up toward my heart ! <EOS>
<SOS> with the earl , sir , here within . <EOS>
<SOS> follow me not . <EOS>
<SOS> stay here . <EOS>
<SOS> made you no more offense but what you speak of ? <EOS>
<SOS> none . <EOS>
<SOS> how chance the king comes with so small a train ? <EOS>
<SOS> an thou hadst been set i ' th ' stocks for that question , thou ’ dst well deserved it . <EOS>
<SOS> why , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there ’ s no laboring i ' th ' winter . <EOS>
<SOS> all that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men , and there ’ s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that ’ s stinking . <EOS>
<SOS> let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill , lest it break thy neck with following it . <EOS>
<SOS> but the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after . <EOS>
<SOS> when a wise man gives thee better counsel , give me mine again . <EOS>
<SOS> i would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it . <EOS>
<SOS> that sir which serves and seeks for gain , and follows but for form , will pack when it begins to rain and leave thee in the storm . <EOS>
<SOS> but i will tarry . <EOS>
<SOS> the fool will stay . <EOS>
<SOS> and let the wise man fly . <EOS>
<SOS> where learned you this , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> not i ' th ' stocks , fool . <EOS>
<SOS> deny to speak with me ? <EOS>
<SOS> they are sick ? <EOS>
<SOS> they are weary ? <EOS>
<SOS> the images of revolt and flying off . <EOS>
<SOS> my dear lord , you know the fiery quality of the duke , how unremoveable and fixed he is in his own course . <EOS>
<SOS> vengeance , plague , death , confusion ! <EOS>
<SOS> fiery ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> what “ quality ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , propn , propn , i ’ d speak with the propn of propn and his wife . <EOS>
<SOS> well , my good lord , i have informed them so . <EOS>
<SOS> informed them ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou understand me , man ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , my good lord . <EOS>
<SOS> the king would speak with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> are they “ informed ” of this ? <EOS>
<SOS> my breath and blood ! <EOS>
<SOS> fiery ” ? <EOS>
<SOS> the “ fiery ” duke ? <EOS>
<SOS> tell the hot duke that lear— no , but not yet . <EOS>
<SOS> maybe he is not well . <EOS>
<SOS> i would have all well betwixt you . <EOS>
<SOS> o me , my heart , my rising heart ! <EOS>
<SOS> but down . <EOS>
<SOS> good morrow to you both . <EOS>
<SOS> hail to your grace . <EOS>
<SOS> i am glad to see your highness . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i think you are . <EOS>
<SOS> i know what reason i have to think so : if thou shouldst not be glad , i would divorce me from thy mother ’ s tomb , sepulchring an adultress . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , propn sister ’ s naught . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , she hath tied sharp - toothed unkindness , like a vulture , here . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , sir , take patience . <EOS>
<SOS> say , how is that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can not think my sister in the least would fail her obligation . <EOS>
<SOS> if , sir , perchance she have restrained the riots of your followers , ' propn on such ground and to such wholesome end as clears her from all blame . <EOS>
<SOS> my curses on her ! <EOS>
<SOS> o sir , you are old . <EOS>
<SOS> nature in you stands on the very verge of his confine . <EOS>
<SOS> you should be ruled and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore i pray you that to our sister you do make return . <EOS>
<SOS> say you have wronged her , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> ask her forgiveness ? <EOS>
<SOS> on my knees i beg that you ’ ll vouchsafe me raiment , bed , and food . ” good sir , no more . <EOS>
<SOS> these are unsightly tricks . <EOS>
<SOS> return you to my sister . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , fie ! <EOS>
<SOS> you nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes ! <EOS>
<SOS> infect her beauty , you fen - sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun , to fall and blister ! <EOS>
<SOS> o the blessed gods ! <EOS>
<SOS> so will you wish on me when the rash mood is on . <EOS>
<SOS> her eyes are fierce , but thine do comfort and not burn . <EOS>
<SOS> thy half o ' th ' kingdom hast thou not forgot , wherein i thee endowed . <EOS>
<SOS> good sir , to the purpose . <EOS>
<SOS> hence , and avoid my sight ! — so be my grave my peace as here i give her father ’ s heart from her .— propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn propn and propn , with my two daughters ' dowers digest this third . <EOS>
<SOS> let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , whom i have ever honored as my king , loved as my father , as my master followed , as my great patron thought on in my prayers— the bow is bent and drawn . <EOS>
<SOS> let it fall rather , though the fork invade the region of my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> be propn unmannerly when propn is mad . <EOS>
<SOS> what wouldst thou do , old man ? <EOS>
<SOS> think ’ st thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows ? <EOS>
<SOS> to plainness honor ’ s bound when majesty falls to folly . <EOS>
<SOS> what trumpet propn that ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know propn — my sister propn . <EOS>
<SOS> this approves her letter that she would soon be here . <EOS>
<SOS> this is a slave whose easy borrowed pride propn in the fickle grace of her he follows.— out , varlet , from my sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> what means your grace ? <EOS>
<SOS> who stocked my servant ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i have good hope propn didst not know on propn .— who comes here ? <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , wilt thou take her by the hand ? <EOS>
<SOS> how have i offended ? <EOS>
<SOS> i set him there , sir , but his own disorders deserved much less advancement . <EOS>
<SOS> you ! <EOS>
<SOS> did you ? <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , father , being weak , seem so . <EOS>
<SOS> if till the expiration of your month , you will return and sojourn with my sister , dismissing half your train , come then to me . <EOS>
<SOS> i am now from home , and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment . <EOS>
<SOS> return to her , and fifty men dismissed ? <EOS>
<SOS> return with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , the hot - blooded propn that dowerless took our youngest born — i could as well be brought to knee his throne , and , squirelike , pension beg to keep base life afoot . <EOS>
<SOS> return with her ? <EOS>
<SOS> persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to this detested groom . <EOS>
<SOS> at your choice , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> now , i prithee , daughter , do not make me mad . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not trouble thee , my child . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll no more meet , no more see one another . <EOS>
<SOS> but yet thou art my flesh , my blood , my daughter— or rather a disease that ’ s in my flesh , which i must needs call mine . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art a boil , a plague - sore or embossèd carbuncle in my corrupted blood . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll not chide thee . <EOS>
<SOS> i do not bid the thunder - bearer shoot , nor tell tales of thee to high - judging propn . <EOS>
<SOS> mend when thou canst . <EOS>
<SOS> be better at thy leisure . <EOS>
<SOS> i can be patient . <EOS>
<SOS> i can stay with propn , i and my hundred knights . <EOS>
<SOS> not altogether so , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i looked not for you yet , nor am provided for your fit welcome . <EOS>
<SOS> give ear , sir , to my sister . <EOS>
<SOS> for those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old , and so— but she knows what she does . <EOS>
<SOS> i dare avouch it , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> how , in one house , should many people under two commands hold amity ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn hard ; almost impossible . <EOS>
<SOS> why might not you , my lord , receive attendance from those that she calls servants , or from mine ? <EOS>
<SOS> why not , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> if then they chanced to slack you , we could control them . <EOS>
<SOS> if you will come to me— for now i spy a danger — i entreat you to bring but five and twenty . <EOS>
<SOS> to no more will i give place or notice . <EOS>
<SOS> i gave you all— and in good time you gave it . <EOS>
<SOS> made you my guardians , my depositaries , but kept a reservation to be followed with such a number . <EOS>
<SOS> what , must i come to you with five and twenty , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> said you so ? <EOS>
<SOS> and speak propn again , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> no more with me . <EOS>
<SOS> not being the worst propn in some rank of praise . <EOS>
<SOS> hear me , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> what need you five and twenty , ten , or five to follow in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you ? <EOS>
<SOS> what need one ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , reason not the need ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou art a lady . <EOS>
<SOS> if only to go warm were gorgeous , why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear ’ st , which scarcely keeps thee warm . <EOS>
<SOS> but , for true need— you heavens , give me that patience , patience i need . <EOS>
<SOS> you see me here , you gods , a poor old man , as full of grief as age , wretched in both . <EOS>
<SOS> if it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts against their father , fool me not so much to bear it tamely . <EOS>
<SOS> no , you unnatural hags , <EOS>
<SOS> i will have such revenges on you both that all the world shall — i will do such things— what they are yet i know not , but they shall be the terrors of the earth . <EOS>
<SOS> you think i ’ ll weep ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , i ’ ll not weep . <EOS>
<SOS> i have full cause of weeping , but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , or ere i ’ ll weep .— o propn , i shall go mad ! <EOS>
<SOS> let us withdraw . <EOS>
<SOS> propn be a storm . <EOS>
<SOS> this house is little . <EOS>
<SOS> the old man and his people can not be well bestowed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn his own blame . <EOS>
<SOS> propn put himself from rest , and must needs taste his folly . <EOS>
<SOS> so am i purposed . <EOS>
<SOS> where is my lord of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> followed the old man forth . <EOS>
<SOS> he is returned . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is he going ? <EOS>
<SOS> he calls to horse , but will i know not whither . <EOS>
<SOS> propn best to give him way . <EOS>
<SOS> he leads himself . <EOS>
<SOS> for many miles about there ’ s scarce a bush . <EOS>
<SOS> o sir , to wilful men , the injuries that they themselves procure must be their schoolmasters . <EOS>
<SOS> shut up your doors . <EOS>
<SOS> he is attended with a desperate train . <EOS>
<SOS> and what they may incense him to , being apt to have his ear abused , wisdom bids fear . <EOS>
<SOS> shut up your doors , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a wild night . <EOS>
<SOS> my propn counsels well . <EOS>
<SOS> come out o ' th ' storm . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there , besides foul weather ? <EOS>
<SOS> one minded like the weather , most unquietly . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> contending with the fretful elements . <EOS>
<SOS> bids the winds blow the earth into the sea or swell the curlèd water ' bove the main , that things might change or cease . <EOS>
<SOS> tears his white hair , which the impetuous blasts , with eyeless rage , catch in their fury and make nothing of . <EOS>
<SOS> strives in his little world of man to outscorn the to - and - fro – conflicting wind and rain . <EOS>
<SOS> this night — wherein the cub - drawn bear would couch , the lion and the belly - pinchèd wolf keep their fur dry — unbonneted he runs , and bids what will take all . <EOS>
<SOS> but who is with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> none but the fool , who labors to outjest his heart - struck injuries . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i do know you , and dare upon the warrant of my note propn a dear thing to you . <EOS>
<SOS> from propn there comes a power into this scattered kingdom , who already , wise in our negligence , have secret feet in some of our best ports and are at point to show their open banner . <EOS>
<SOS> now to you . <EOS>
<SOS> i am a gentleman of blood and breeding , and from some knowledge and assurance offer this office to you . <EOS>
<SOS> i will talk further with you . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> have you no more to say ? <EOS>
<SOS> rage , blow ! <EOS>
<SOS> you cataracts and hurricanoes , spout till you have drenched our steeples , drowned the cocks ! <EOS>
<SOS> you sulfurous and thought - executing fires , propn - couriers of oak - cleaving thunderbolts , singe my white head ! <EOS>
<SOS> and thou , all - shaking thunder , propn flat the thick rotundity o ' th ' world , propn nature ’ s molds , all germens spill at once that make ingrateful man ! <EOS>
<SOS> o nuncle , court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o ' door . <EOS>
<SOS> good nuncle , in , and ask thy daughters blessing . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s a night pities neither wise man nor fool . <EOS>
<SOS> rumble thy bellyful ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , fire ! <EOS>
<SOS> spout , rain ! <EOS>
<SOS> nor rain , wind , thunder , fire are my daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> i tax not you , you elements , with unkindness . <EOS>
<SOS> why then , let fall your horrible pleasure . <EOS>
<SOS> here i stand , your slave— a poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man . <EOS>
<SOS> he that has a house to put ’ s head in has a good headpiece . <EOS>
<SOS> answer my life my judgment , propn youngest daughter does not love thee least , nor are those empty - hearted whose low sound propn no hollowness . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , on thy life , no more . <EOS>
<SOS> out of my sight ! <EOS>
<SOS> see better , propn , and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye . <EOS>
<SOS> now , by propn now , by propn , propn , propn swear ’ st thy gods in vain . <EOS>
<SOS> o vassal ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> dear sir , forbear ! <EOS>
<SOS> hear me , recreant ! <EOS>
<SOS> for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i will be the pattern of all patience . <EOS>
<SOS> i will say nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> marry , here ’ s grace and a codpiece — that ’ s a wise man and a fool . <EOS>
<SOS> let the great gods that keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads find out their enemies now . <EOS>
<SOS> some friendship will it lend you ' gainst the tempest . <EOS>
<SOS> repose you there , while i to this hard house— more harder than the stones whereof ’ tis raised , which even but now , demanding after you , denied me to come in — return , and force their scanted courtesy . <EOS>
<SOS> my wits begin to turn.— come on , my boy . <EOS>
<SOS> true , my good boy .— come , bring us to this hovel . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll speak a prophecy ere i go . <EOS>
<SOS> then comes the time , who lives to see propn , that going shall be used with feet . <EOS>
<SOS> this prophecy propn shall make , for i live before his time . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , alack , propn , i like not this unnatural dealing . <EOS>
<SOS> when i desire their leave that i might pity him , they took from me the use of mine own house , charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him , entreat for him , nor any way sustain him . <EOS>
<SOS> most savage and unnatural ! <EOS>
<SOS> go to , say you nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a division betwixt the dukes . <EOS>
<SOS> propn dangerous to be spoken . <EOS>
<SOS> i have locked the letter in my closet . <EOS>
<SOS> these injuries the king now bears will be revenged home . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s part of a power already footed . <EOS>
<SOS> we must incline to the king . <EOS>
<SOS> i will look him and privily relieve him . <EOS>
<SOS> go you and maintain talk with the duke , that my charity be not of him perceived . <EOS>
<SOS> if he ask for me , i am ill and gone to bed . <EOS>
<SOS> though i die for it — as no less is threatened me — the king my old master must be relieved . <EOS>
<SOS> there is some strange thing toward , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , be careful . <EOS>
<SOS> this courtesy , forbid thee , shall the duke instantly know , and of that letter too . <EOS>
<SOS> the younger rises when the old doth fall . <EOS>
<SOS> here is the place , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> good my lord , enter . <EOS>
<SOS> the tyranny of the open night propn too rough for nature to endure . <EOS>
<SOS> let me alone . <EOS>
<SOS> good my lord , enter here . <EOS>
<SOS> propn break my heart ? <EOS>
<SOS> i had rather break mine own . <EOS>
<SOS> good my lord , enter . <EOS>
<SOS> propn think ’ st ’ tis much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin . <EOS>
<SOS> so ’ tis to thee . <EOS>
<SOS> but where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt . <EOS>
<SOS> thou ’ dst shun a bear , but if thy flight lay toward the raging sea propn meet the bear i ' th ' mouth . <EOS>
<SOS> when the mind ’ s free , the body ’ s delicate . <EOS>
<SOS> the tempest in my mind propn from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there — filial ingratitude . <EOS>
<SOS> is it not as this mouth should tear this hand for lifting food to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> but i will punish home . <EOS>
<SOS> no , i will weep no more . <EOS>
<SOS> in such a night to shut me out ! <EOS>
<SOS> pour on , i will endure . <EOS>
<SOS> in such a night as this ! <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , propn , your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all— oh , that way madness lies . <EOS>
<SOS> let me shun that . <EOS>
<SOS> no more of that . <EOS>
<SOS> good my lord , enter here . <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , go in thyself . <EOS>
<SOS> seek thine own ease . <EOS>
<SOS> this tempest will not give me leave to ponder on things would hurt me more . <EOS>
<SOS> but i ’ ll go in . <EOS>
<SOS> expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , that thou mayst shake the superflux to them and show the heavens more just . <EOS>
<SOS> come not in here , nuncle . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s a spirit . <EOS>
<SOS> help me , help me ! <EOS>
<SOS> give me thy hand . <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> a spirit , a spirit . <EOS>
<SOS> he says his name propn propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what art thou that dost grumble there i ' th ' straw ? <EOS>
<SOS> come forth . <EOS>
<SOS> away ! <EOS>
<SOS> the foul fiend follows me ! <EOS>
<SOS> through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind . <EOS>
<SOS> hum ! <EOS>
<SOS> go to thy cold bed and warm thee . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou give all to thy two daughters , and art thou come to this ? <EOS>
<SOS> bless thy five wits . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn a - cold . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , do - de , do - de , do - de . <EOS>
<SOS> bless thee from whirlwinds , star - blasting , and taking ! <EOS>
<SOS> do propn propn some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes . <EOS>
<SOS> there could i have him now — and there — and there again — and there . <EOS>
<SOS> what , has his daughters brought him to this pass ? — propn thou save nothing ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou give 'em all ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed . <EOS>
<SOS> now all the plagues that in the pendulous air propn fated o'er men ’ s faults light on thy daughters ! <EOS>
<SOS> he hath no daughters , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> death , traitor ! <EOS>
<SOS> nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> is it the fashion that discarded fathers should have thus little mercy on their flesh ? <EOS>
<SOS> twas this flesh begot those pelican daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> this cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen . <EOS>
<SOS> take heed o ' th ' foul fiend . <EOS>
<SOS> obey thy parents , keep thy word ’ s justice , swear not , commit not with man ’ s sworn spouse , set not thy sweet heart on proud array . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn a- cold . <EOS>
<SOS> what hast thou been ? <EOS>
<SOS> wine loved i deeply , dice dearly , and in woman outparamoured the propn . <EOS>
<SOS> still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind , says , “ propn , mun , nonny . ” propn my boy , my boy , cessez . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art the thing itself . <EOS>
<SOS> unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor , bare , forked animal as thou propn propn , off , you lendings ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn here . <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , nuncle , be contented . <EOS>
<SOS> propn a naughty night to swim in . <EOS>
<SOS> now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher ’ s heart — a small spark , all the rest on ’ s body cold . <EOS>
<SOS> look , here comes a walking fire . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the foul fiend propn . <EOS>
<SOS> he begins at curfew and walks till the first cock . <EOS>
<SOS> and aroint thee , witch , aroint thee ! <EOS>
<SOS> how fares your grace ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> what is propn you seek ? <EOS>
<SOS> what are you there ? <EOS>
<SOS> your names ? <EOS>
<SOS> peace , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn he ’ s called , and propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn propn a - cold . <EOS>
<SOS> go in with me . <EOS>
<SOS> my duty can not suffer to obey in all your daughters ' hard commands . <EOS>
<SOS> though their injunction be to bar my doors and let this tyrannous night take hold upon you , yet have i ventured to come seek you out and bring you where both fire and food is ready . <EOS>
<SOS> first let me talk with this philosopher.— <EOS>
<SOS> away ! <EOS>
<SOS> by propn , this shall not be revoked . <EOS>
<SOS> why , fare thee well , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s propn and propn , my noble lord . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> we first address towards you , who with this king propn rivaled for our daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> let me ask you one word in private . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou blame him ? <EOS>
<SOS> his daughters seek his death . <EOS>
<SOS> ah , that good kent— he said it would be thus , poor banished man . <EOS>
<SOS> thou propn the king grows mad . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll tell thee , friend , i am almost mad myself . <EOS>
<SOS> i had a son , now outlawed from my blood . <EOS>
<SOS> he sought my life , but lately , very late . <EOS>
<SOS> i loved him , friend— no father his son dearer . <EOS>
<SOS> what a night propn this ! <EOS>
<SOS> o , cry your mercy , propn propn propn a - cold . <EOS>
<SOS> keep thee warm . <EOS>
<SOS> come let ’ s in all . <EOS>
<SOS> this way , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> come , good propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i will have my revenge ere i depart his house . <EOS>
<SOS> how , my lord , i may be censured , that nature thus gives way to loyalty , something fears me to think of . <EOS>
<SOS> i now perceive it was not altogether your brother ’ s evil disposition made him seek his death , but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself . <EOS>
<SOS> how malicious is my fortune , that i must repent to be just ! <EOS>
<SOS> go with me to the duchess . <EOS>
<SOS> if the matter of this paper be certain , you have mighty business in hand . <EOS>
<SOS> true or false , it hath made thee propn of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i will lay trust upon thee , and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love . <EOS>
<SOS> here is better than the open air . <EOS>
<SOS> take it thankfully . <EOS>
<SOS> i will piece out the comfort with what addition i can . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not be long from you . <EOS>
<SOS> all the power of his wits have given way to his impatience . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods reward your kindness ! <EOS>
<SOS> a king , a king ! <EOS>
<SOS> no , he ’ s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son , for he ’ s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him . <EOS>
<SOS> to have a thousand with red burning spits come hissing in upon 'em ! <EOS>
<SOS> the foul fiend bites my back . <EOS>
<SOS> it shall be done . <EOS>
<SOS> the foul fiend haunts propn propn in the voice of a nightingale . <EOS>
<SOS> hoppedance cries in propn ’ s belly for two white herring . <EOS>
<SOS> croak not , black angel . <EOS>
<SOS> i have no food for thee . <EOS>
<SOS> sit you too . <EOS>
<SOS> let us deal justly . <EOS>
<SOS> i here take my oath before this honorable assembly , she kicked the poor king her father . <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , mistress . <EOS>
<SOS> is your name propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> she can not deny it . <EOS>
<SOS> and here ’ s another , whose warped looks proclaim what store her heart is made on . <EOS>
<SOS> stop her there ! <EOS>
<SOS> arms , arms , sword , fire , corruption in the place ! <EOS>
<SOS> false justicer , why hast thou let her ’ scape ? <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ ll mar my counterfeiting . <EOS>
<SOS> the little dogs and all , propn , propn , and propn — see , they bark at me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn will throw his head at them .— propn , you curs ! <EOS>
<SOS> tooth that poisons if it bite , propn , greyhound , mongrel grim , <EOS>
<SOS> hound or spaniel , brach or him , propn tyke or trundle - propn propn will make them weep and wail . <EOS>
<SOS> for with throwing thus my head , propn leap the hatch , and all are fled . <EOS>
<SOS> be thy mouth or black or white , do - de , propn - propn . <EOS>
<SOS> cessez ! <EOS>
<SOS> come , march to wakes and fairs and market towns . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn , thy horn is dry . <EOS>
<SOS> is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts ? <EOS>
<SOS> now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile . <EOS>
<SOS> make no noise , make no noise . <EOS>
<SOS> draw the curtains — so , so , so . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll go to supper i ' th ' morning . <EOS>
<SOS> so , so , so . <EOS>
<SOS> and i ’ ll go to bed at noon . <EOS>
<SOS> here , sir , but trouble him not . <EOS>
<SOS> his wits are gone . <EOS>
<SOS> good friend , i prithee , take him in thy arms . <EOS>
<SOS> there is a litter ready . <EOS>
<SOS> come , help to bear thy master . <EOS>
<SOS> come , come , away . <EOS>
<SOS> when we our betters see bearing our woes , we scarcely think our miseries our foes . <EOS>
<SOS> who alone suffers , suffers most i ' th ' mind , leaving free things and happy shows behind . <EOS>
<SOS> but then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , away ! <EOS>
<SOS> what will hap more tonight , safe ’ scape the king ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , lurk . <EOS>
<SOS> hang him instantly . <EOS>
<SOS> propn out his eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> leave him to my displeasure .— edmund , keep you our sister company . <EOS>
<SOS> the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding . <EOS>
<SOS> advise the duke where you are going , to a most festinate preparation . <EOS>
<SOS> we are bound to the like . <EOS>
<SOS> our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us .— propn , dear sister . <EOS>
<SOS> how now ? <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord of propn hath conveyed him hence . <EOS>
<SOS> some five or six and thirty of his knights , hot questrists after him , met him at gate , who with some other of the lord ’ s dependants are gone with him towards propn , where they boast to have well - armèd friends . <EOS>
<SOS> get horses for your mistress . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sweet lord , and sister . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund , farewell . <EOS>
<SOS> go seek the traitor propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn him like a thief , bring him before us . <EOS>
<SOS> ingrateful fox , ’ tis he . <EOS>
<SOS> bind fast his corky arms . <EOS>
<SOS> what mean your graces ? <EOS>
<SOS> good my friends , consider you are my guests . <EOS>
<SOS> do me no foul play , friends . <EOS>
<SOS> bind him , i say . <EOS>
<SOS> most royal majesty , i crave no more than hath your highness offered . <EOS>
<SOS> nor will you tender less . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , there she stands . <EOS>
<SOS> i know no answer . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , will you , with those infirmities she owes— unfriended , new adopted to our hate , dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath— take her or leave her ? <EOS>
<SOS> then leave her , sir , for by the power that made me , i tell you all her wealth . <EOS>
<SOS> hard , hard .— o filthy traitor ! <EOS>
<SOS> unmerciful lady as you are , i ’ m none . <EOS>
<SOS> to this chair bind him .— propn , thou shalt find— by the kind gods , ’ tis most ignobly done to pluck me by the beard . <EOS>
<SOS> so white , and such a traitor ? <EOS>
<SOS> naughty lady , these hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin will quicken and accuse thee . <EOS>
<SOS> i am your host . <EOS>
<SOS> with robbers ' hands my hospitable favors you should not ruffle thus . <EOS>
<SOS> what will you do ? <EOS>
<SOS> come , sir , what letters had you late from propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> be simple - answered , for we know the truth . <EOS>
<SOS> and what confederacy have you with the traitors late footed in the kingdom ? <EOS>
<SOS> to whose hands you have sent the lunatic king . <EOS>
<SOS> speak . <EOS>
<SOS> i have a letter guessingly set down , which came from one that ’ s of a neutral heart , and not from one opposed . <EOS>
<SOS> cunning . <EOS>
<SOS> and false . <EOS>
<SOS> where hast thou sent the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> wherefore to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> wast thou not charged at propn propn to propn ? — let him first answer that . <EOS>
<SOS> i am tied to th ' stake , and i must stand the course . <EOS>
<SOS> wherefore to propn , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> because i would not see thy cruèl nails propn out his poor old eyes , nor thy fierce sister in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs . <EOS>
<SOS> the sea , with such a storm as his bare head in hell - black night endured , would have buoyed up , and quenched the stellèd fires . <EOS>
<SOS> yet poor old heart , he holp the heavens to rain . <EOS>
<SOS> if wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time , thou shouldst have said , “ good porter , turn the key , ” all cruèls else subscribed . <EOS>
<SOS> but i shall see the wingèd vengeance overtake such children . <EOS>
<SOS> see ” ’ t shalt thou never .— fellows , hold the chair.— upon these eyes of thine i ’ ll set my foot . <EOS>
<SOS> he that will think to live till he be old , give me some help ! <EOS>
<SOS> o cruel ! <EOS>
<SOS> o you gods ! <EOS>
<SOS> one side will mock another — th ' other too . <EOS>
<SOS> but better service have i never done you than now to bid you hold . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , you dog ? <EOS>
<SOS> if you did wear a beard upon your chin , i ’ d shake it on this quarrel . <EOS>
<SOS> what do you mean ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay then , come on , and take the chance of anger . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , i am slain ! —my lord , you have one eye left to see some mischief on him . <EOS>
<SOS> oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> where is thy luster now ? <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s my son propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> out , treacherous villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou call ’ st on him that hates thee . <EOS>
<SOS> it was he that made the overture of thy treasons to us , who is too good to pity thee . <EOS>
<SOS> o my follies ! <EOS>
<SOS> then propn was abused . <EOS>
<SOS> go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell his way to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i have received a hurt . <EOS>
<SOS> follow me , lady.— turn out that eyeless villain . <EOS>
<SOS> throw this slave upon the dunghill .— propn , i bleed apace . <EOS>
<SOS> untimely comes this hurt . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your arm . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll never care what wickedness i do , if this man come to good . <EOS>
<SOS> if she live long , and in the end meet the old course of death , propn will all turn monsters . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s follow the old earl , and get the propn to lead him where he would . <EOS>
<SOS> his roguish madness allows itself to any thing . <EOS>
<SOS> go thou . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to apply to his bleeding face . <EOS>
<SOS> now propn help him ! <EOS>
<SOS> the lamentable change is from the best ; the worst returns to laughter . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , then , thou unsubstantial air that i embrace ! <EOS>
<SOS> but who comes here ? <EOS>
<SOS> my father , poorly led ? <EOS>
<SOS> world , world , o world ! <EOS>
<SOS> but that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , propn would not yield to age . <EOS>
<SOS> i have been your tenant and your father ’ s tenant these fourscore years . <EOS>
<SOS> away , get thee away . <EOS>
<SOS> good friend , be gone . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , you can not see your way . <EOS>
<SOS> i have no way , and therefore want no eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> i stumbled when i saw . <EOS>
<SOS> full oft ’ tis seen , our means secure us and our mere defects prove our commodities . <EOS>
<SOS> o dear son propn , the food of thy abusèd father ’ s wrath , might i but live to see thee in my touch , i ’ d say i had eyes again ! <EOS>
<SOS> how now ? <EOS>
<SOS> who ’ s there ? <EOS>
<SOS> madman and beggar too . <EOS>
<SOS> my son came then into my mind , and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him . <EOS>
<SOS> i have heard more since . <EOS>
<SOS> is that the naked fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , he is mad . <EOS>
<SOS> propn the time ’ s plague when madmen lead the blind . <EOS>
<SOS> do as i bid thee . <EOS>
<SOS> or rather , do thy pleasure . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , naked fellow— propn propn propn a - cold . <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , fellow . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou the way to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn hath been scared out of his good wits . <EOS>
<SOS> so bless thee , master . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , master . <EOS>
<SOS> there is a cliff , whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confinèd deep . <EOS>
<SOS> bring me but to the very brim of it , and i ’ ll repair the misery thou dost bear with something rich about me . <EOS>
<SOS> from that place i shall no leading need . <EOS>
<SOS> give me thy arm . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn shall lead thee . <EOS>
<SOS> welcome , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i marvel our mild husband not met us on the way . <EOS>
<SOS> now , where ’ s your master ? <EOS>
<SOS> sure , her offense must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it ( or your fore - vouched affection propn into taint ) , which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle could never plant in me . <EOS>
<SOS> go to , go to . <EOS>
<SOS> better thou propn not been born than not t ' have pleased me better . <EOS>
<SOS> is it no more but this — a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do ? — my lord of propn , what say you to the lady ? <EOS>
<SOS> love ’ s not love when it is mingled with regards that stands propn from th ' entire point . <EOS>
<SOS> will you have her ? <EOS>
<SOS> she is herself a dowry . <EOS>
<SOS> yours in the ranks of death . <EOS>
<SOS> my most dear propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , the difference of man and man ! <EOS>
<SOS> to thee a woman ’ s services are due . <EOS>
<SOS> my fool usurps my body . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , here comes my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i have been worth the whistle . <EOS>
<SOS> o propn , you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face . <EOS>
<SOS> i fear your disposition . <EOS>
<SOS> that nature , which contemns its origin can not be bordered certain in itself . <EOS>
<SOS> she that herself will sliver and disbranch from her material sap perforce must wither and come to deadly use . <EOS>
<SOS> no more . <EOS>
<SOS> the text is foolish . <EOS>
<SOS> wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile . <EOS>
<SOS> filths savor but themselves . <EOS>
<SOS> what have you done ? <EOS>
<SOS> tigers , not daughters , what have you performed ? <EOS>
<SOS> could my good brother suffer you to do it— a man , a prince by him so benefited ? <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s thy drum ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou changèd and self - covered thing , for shame ! <EOS>
<SOS> bemonster not thy feature . <EOS>
<SOS> were propn my fitness to let these hands obey my blood , they are apt enough to dislocate and tear propn flesh and bones . <EOS>
<SOS> howe'er thou art a fiend , a woman ’ s shape doth shield thee . <EOS>
<SOS> marry , your manhood , mew ! <EOS>
<SOS> what news ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s eyes ? <EOS>
<SOS> but oh , poor propn lost he his other eye ? <EOS>
<SOS> both , both , my lord.— this letter , madam , craves a speedy answer . <EOS>
<SOS> propn from your sister . <EOS>
<SOS> one way i like this well . <EOS>
<SOS> but being widow , and my propn with her , may all the building in my fancy pluck upon my hateful life . <EOS>
<SOS> come with my lady hither . <EOS>
<SOS> he is not here . <EOS>
<SOS> no , my good lord . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , my good lord . <EOS>
<SOS> twas he informed against him , and quit the house on purpose that their punishment might have the freer course . <EOS>
<SOS> tell me what more thou know ’ st . <EOS>
<SOS> why the propn of propn is so suddenly gone back know you the reason ? <EOS>
<SOS> something he left imperfect in the state which , since his coming forth , is thought of ; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary . <EOS>
<SOS> who hath he left behind him general ? <EOS>
<SOS> the propn of propn , propn propn propn . <EOS>
<SOS> did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> it seemed she was a queen over her passion , who , most rebel - like , sought to be king o'er her . <EOS>
<SOS> o , then it moved her ? <EOS>
<SOS> in brief , propn would be a rarity most beloved if all could so become it . <EOS>
<SOS> made she no verbal question ? <EOS>
<SOS> faith , once or twice she heaved the name of “ father ” pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart , propn , “ propn , sisters ! <EOS>
<SOS> shame of ladies , sisters ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , father , sisters ! <EOS>
<SOS> what , i ' th ' storm , i ' th ' night ? <EOS>
<SOS> let pity not be believed . ” there she shook the holy water from her heavenly eyes , and clamor moistened . <EOS>
<SOS> then away she started to deal with grief alone . <EOS>
<SOS> you spoke not with her since ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> was this before the king returned ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , since . <EOS>
<SOS> why , good sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> a sovereign shame so elbows him . <EOS>
<SOS> his own unkindness that stripped her from his benediction turned her to foreign casualties , gave her dear rights to his dog - hearted daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> these things sting his mind so venomously that burning shame detains him from propn . <EOS>
<SOS> alack , poor gentleman ! <EOS>
<SOS> of propn ’ s and propn ’ s powers you heard not ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn so . <EOS>
<SOS> they are afoot . <EOS>
<SOS> well , sir , i ’ ll bring you to our master propn and leave you to attend him . <EOS>
<SOS> some dear cause will in concealment wrap me up awhile . <EOS>
<SOS> when i am known aright you shall not grieve lending me this acquaintance . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , go along with me . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , ’ tis he . <EOS>
<SOS> why , he was met even now as mad as the vexed sea , singing aloud , crowned with rank fumiter and furrow - weeds , with burdocks , hemlock , nettles , cuckoo - flowers , propn , and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn .— a century send forth . <EOS>
<SOS> search every acre in the high - grown field , and bring him to our eye . <EOS>
<SOS> there is means , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> our foster nurse of nature is repose , the which he lacks — that to provoke in him are many simples operative , whose power will close the eye of anguish . <EOS>
<SOS> all blessed secrets , all you unpublished virtues of the earth , spring with my tears . <EOS>
<SOS> be aidant and remediate in the good man ’ s distress . <EOS>
<SOS> seek , seek for him , lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it . <EOS>
<SOS> news , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> the british powers are marching hitherward . <EOS>
<SOS> propn known before . <EOS>
<SOS> our preparation stands in expectation of them . <EOS>
<SOS> o dear father , it is thy business that i go about . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore great propn my mourning and importuned tears hath pitied . <EOS>
<SOS> no blown ambition doth our arms incite , but love — dear love ! —and our aged father ’ s right . <EOS>
<SOS> soon may i hear and see him . <EOS>
<SOS> but are my brother ’ s powers set forth ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> himself in person there ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , with much ado . <EOS>
<SOS> your sister is the better soldier . <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn spake not with your lord at home ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> what might import my sister ’ s letter to him ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know not , lady . <EOS>
<SOS> faith , he is posted hence on serious matter . <EOS>
<SOS> it was great ignorance , propn ’ s eyes being out , to let him live . <EOS>
<SOS> where he arrives he moves all hearts against us . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund i think is gone in pity of his misery to dispatch his nighted life ; moreover to descry the strength o ' th ' enemy . <EOS>
<SOS> i must needs after him , madam , with my letter . <EOS>
<SOS> our troops set forth tomorrow . <EOS>
<SOS> stay with us . <EOS>
<SOS> the ways are dangerous . <EOS>
<SOS> peace be with propn . <EOS>
<SOS> since that respects and fortunes are his love , i shall not be his wife . <EOS>
<SOS> thee and thy virtues here i seize upon , be it lawful i take up what ’ s cast away . <EOS>
<SOS> not all the dukes of waterish propn can buy this unprized precious maid of me.— bid them farewell , propn , though unkind . <EOS>
<SOS> let her be thine , for we have no such daughter , nor shall ever see that face of hers again . <EOS>
<SOS> bid farewell to your sisters . <EOS>
<SOS> i may not , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> my lady charged my duty in this business . <EOS>
<SOS> why should she write to propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn some things — i know not what . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i had rather— i know your lady does not love her husband . <EOS>
<SOS> i am sure of that . <EOS>
<SOS> and at her late being here she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks to noble edmund . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you are of her bosom . <EOS>
<SOS> i , madam ? <EOS>
<SOS> i speak in understanding . <EOS>
<SOS> therefore i do advise you , take this note . <EOS>
<SOS> my lord is dead . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund and i have talked , and more convenient is he for my hand than for your lady propn . <EOS>
<SOS> you may gather more . <EOS>
<SOS> fare thee well . <EOS>
<SOS> when shall we come to th ' top of that same hill ? <EOS>
<SOS> methinks the ground is even . <EOS>
<SOS> horrible steep . <EOS>
<SOS> no , truly . <EOS>
<SOS> why then , your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes ' anguish . <EOS>
<SOS> so may it be indeed . <EOS>
<SOS> methinks thy voice is altered , and thou speak ’ st in better phrase and matter than thou didst . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re much deceived . <EOS>
<SOS> in nothing am i changed but in my garments . <EOS>
<SOS> methinks you ’ re better spoken . <EOS>
<SOS> come on , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> here ’ s the place . <EOS>
<SOS> stand still . <EOS>
<SOS> how fearful and dizzy ’ tis to cast one ’ s eyes so low ! <EOS>
<SOS> the crows and choughs that wing the midway air propn scarce so gross as beetles . <EOS>
<SOS> halfway down propn one that gathers samphire — dreadful trade ! <EOS>
<SOS> and yon tall anchoring bark , <EOS>
<SOS> the murmuring surge that on th ' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes can not be heard so high . <EOS>
<SOS> set me where you stand . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> you are now within a foot of th ' extreme verge . <EOS>
<SOS> let go my hand . <EOS>
<SOS> now fare you well , good sir . <EOS>
<SOS> with all my heart . <EOS>
<SOS> o you mighty gods , this world i do renounce , and in your sights shake patiently my great affliction off . <EOS>
<SOS> gone , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> away , and let me die . <EOS>
<SOS> ten masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell . <EOS>
<SOS> thy life ’ s a miracle . <EOS>
<SOS> speak yet again . <EOS>
<SOS> but have i fall'n , or no ? <EOS>
<SOS> from the dread summit of this chalky bourn . <EOS>
<SOS> look up a - height . <EOS>
<SOS> the shrill - gorged lark so far can not be seen or heard . <EOS>
<SOS> do but look up . <EOS>
<SOS> twas yet some comfort when misery could beguile the tyrant ’ s rage and frustrate his proud will . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your arm . <EOS>
<SOS> up so . <EOS>
<SOS> how is propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> feel you your legs ? <EOS>
<SOS> you stand . <EOS>
<SOS> too well , too well . <EOS>
<SOS> this is above all strangeness . <EOS>
<SOS> upon the crown o ' th ' cliff , what thing was that which parted from you ? <EOS>
<SOS> a poor unfortunate beggar . <EOS>
<SOS> as i stood here below , methought his eyes were two full moons . <EOS>
<SOS> he had a thousand noses , horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea . <EOS>
<SOS> it was some fiend . <EOS>
<SOS> i do remember now . <EOS>
<SOS> henceforth i ’ ll bear affliction till it do cry out itself , “ enough , enough , ” and die . <EOS>
<SOS> that thing you speak of , i took it for a man . <EOS>
<SOS> propn free and patient thoughts . <EOS>
<SOS> but who comes here ? <EOS>

<SOS> alack , alack the day ! <EOS>
<SOS> when we are born , we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools . <EOS>
<SOS> this a good block . <EOS>
<SOS> it were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll put propn in proof . <EOS>
<SOS> and when i have stol'n upon these sons - in - law , then , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill ! <EOS>

<SOS> you are a royal one , and we obey you . <EOS>
<SOS> then there ’ s life in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> a sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , past speaking of in a king . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , gentle sir . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , speed you . <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s your will ? <EOS>
<SOS> do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward ? <EOS>
<SOS> most sure and vulgar . <EOS>
<SOS> everyone hears that that can distinguish sound . <EOS>
<SOS> but , by your favor , how near ’ s the other army ? <EOS>
<SOS> near and on speedy foot . <EOS>
<SOS> the main descry stands in the hourly thought . <EOS>
<SOS> i thank you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s all . <EOS>
<SOS> i know you what you are , and like a sister am most loath to call your faults as they are named . <EOS>
<SOS> but yet , alas , stood i within his grace , i would prefer him to a better place . <EOS>
<SOS> so farewell to you both . <EOS>
<SOS> prescribe not us our duty . <EOS>
<SOS> propn shall unfold what plighted cunning hides , who covers faults at last with shame derides . <EOS>
<SOS> well may you prosper . <EOS>
<SOS> come , my fair propn . <EOS>
<SOS> sister , it is not a little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both . <EOS>
<SOS> i think our father will hence tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s most certain , and with you . <EOS>
<SOS> next month with us . <EOS>
<SOS> you see how full of changes his age is . <EOS>
<SOS> he always loved our sister most , and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly . <EOS>
<SOS> though that the queen on special cause is here , her army is moved on . <EOS>
<SOS> i thank you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> you ever gentle gods , take my breath from me . <EOS>
<SOS> let not my worser spirit tempt me again to die before you please . <EOS>
<SOS> well pray you , father . <EOS>
<SOS> now , good sir , what are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> a most poor man made tame to fortune ’ s blows , who by the art of known and feeling sorrows am pregnant to good pity . <EOS>
<SOS> hearty thanks . <EOS>
<SOS> the bounty and the benison of propn to boot and boot . <EOS>
<SOS> most happy ! <EOS>
<SOS> that eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh to raise my fortunes . <EOS>
<SOS> thou old unhappy traitor , propn thyself remember . <EOS>
<SOS> now let thy friendly hand propn strength enough to propn . <EOS>
<SOS> wherefore , bold peasant , propn thou support a published traitor ? <EOS>
<SOS> hence , lest that th ' infection of his fortune take like hold on thee . <EOS>
<SOS> let go his arm . <EOS>
<SOS> propn not let go , zir , without vurther ' casion . <EOS>
<SOS> let go , slave , or thou diest ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn pick your teeth , zir . <EOS>
<SOS> come , no matter vor your foins . <EOS>
<SOS> if ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body . <EOS>
<SOS> i know thee well — a serviceable villain , as duteous to the vices of thy mistress as badness would desire . <EOS>
<SOS> what , is he dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s see these pockets . <EOS>
<SOS> the letters that he speaks of may be my friends . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s dead . <EOS>
<SOS> i am only sorry he had no other death ’ s - man . <EOS>
<SOS> let us see . <EOS>
<SOS> leave , gentle wax , and , manners , blame us not . <EOS>
<SOS> their papers is more lawful . <EOS>
<SOS> let our reciprocal vows be remembered . <EOS>
<SOS> the king is mad . <EOS>
<SOS> better i were distract— so should my thoughts be severed from my griefs , and woes by wrong imaginations lose the knowledge of themselves . <EOS>
<SOS> give me your hand . <EOS>
<SOS> far off methinks i hear the beaten drum . <EOS>
<SOS> come , father , i ’ ll bestow you with a friend . <EOS>
<SOS> o thou good propn , how shall i live and work to match thy goodness ? <EOS>
<SOS> my life will be too short , and every measure fail me . <EOS>
<SOS> to be acknowledged , madam , is o'erpaid . <EOS>
<SOS> all my reports go with the modest truth , nor more , nor clipped , but so . <EOS>
<SOS> be better suited . <EOS>
<SOS> i prithee , put them off . <EOS>
<SOS> my boon i make it that you know me not till time and i think meet . <EOS>
<SOS> then be propn so , my good lord.— how does the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sleeps still . <EOS>
<SOS> so please your majesty that we may wake the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> he hath slept long . <EOS>
<SOS> is he arrayed ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> be by , good madam , when we do awake him . <EOS>
<SOS> i doubt not of his temperance . <EOS>
<SOS> very well . <EOS>
<SOS> please you , draw near .— louder the music there ! <EOS>
<SOS> kind and dear princess ! <EOS>
<SOS> had you not been their father , these white flakes did challenge pity of them . <EOS>
<SOS> and wast thou fain , poor father , to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn in short and musty straw ? <EOS>
<SOS> alack , alack ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn wonder that thy life and wits at once had not concluded all .— he wakes . <EOS>
<SOS> speak to him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , do you . <EOS>
<SOS> propn fittest . <EOS>
<SOS> how does my royal lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> how fares your majesty ? <EOS>
<SOS> you do me wrong to take me out o ' th ' grave . <EOS>
<SOS> thou art a soul in bliss , but i am bound upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears do scald like molten lead . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , do you know me ? <EOS>
<SOS> you are a spirit , i know . <EOS>
<SOS> where did you die ? <EOS>
<SOS> let him alone awhile . <EOS>
<SOS> where have i been ? <EOS>
<SOS> where am i ? <EOS>
<SOS> fair daylight ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am mightily abused . <EOS>
<SOS> i should ev'n die with pity to see another thus . <EOS>
<SOS> i know not what to say . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not swear these are my hands . <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s see . <EOS>
<SOS> i feel this pinprick . <EOS>
<SOS> would i were assured of my condition . <EOS>
<SOS> pray , do not mock me . <EOS>
<SOS> i am a very foolish fond old man , propn and upward , not an hour more nor less . <EOS>
<SOS> and to deal plainly i fear i am not in my perfect mind . <EOS>
<SOS> methinks i should know you , and know this man . <EOS>
<SOS> nor i know not where i did lodge last night . <EOS>
<SOS> do not laugh at me , for as i am a man , i think this lady to be my child propn . <EOS>
<SOS> and so i am , i am . <EOS>
<SOS> be your tears wet ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes , faith . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray , weep not . <EOS>
<SOS> if you have poison for me , i will drink it . <EOS>
<SOS> you have some cause ; they have not . <EOS>
<SOS> no cause , no cause . <EOS>
<SOS> am i in propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> in your own kingdom , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> do not abuse me . <EOS>
<SOS> be comforted , good madam . <EOS>
<SOS> the great rage , you see , is killed in him . <EOS>
<SOS> and yet it is danger to make him even o'er the time he has lost . <EOS>
<SOS> desire him to go in . <EOS>
<SOS> trouble him no more till further settling . <EOS>
<SOS> will propn please your highness walk ? <EOS>
<SOS> you must bear with me . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you now , forget and forgive . <EOS>
<SOS> i am old and foolish . <EOS>
<SOS> holds it true , sir , that the propn of propn was so slain ? <EOS>
<SOS> most certain , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> who is conductor of his people ? <EOS>
<SOS> as ’ tis said , the bastard son of propn . <EOS>
<SOS> they say propn , his banished son , is with the propn of propn in propn . <EOS>
<SOS> propn is changeable . <EOS>
<SOS> propn time to look about . <EOS>
<SOS> the powers of the kingdom approach apace . <EOS>
<SOS> the arbitrament is like to be bloody . <EOS>
<SOS> fare you well , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> propn to be doubted , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> now , sweet lord , you know the goodness i intend upon you . <EOS>
<SOS> tell me but truly — but then speak the truth— do you not love my sister ? <EOS>
<SOS> in honored love . <EOS>
<SOS> i am doubtful that you have been conjunct and bosomed with her as far as we call hers . <EOS>
<SOS> no , by mine honor , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> propn the infirmity of his age . <EOS>
<SOS> yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself . <EOS>
<SOS> the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash . <EOS>
<SOS> then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long - engrafted condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them . <EOS>
<SOS> such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of propn ’ s banishment . <EOS>
<SOS> there is further compliment of leave - taking between propn and him . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , let ’ s sit together . <EOS>
<SOS> if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears , this last surrender of his will but offend us . <EOS>
<SOS> we shall further think on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> we must do something , and i ' th ' heat . <EOS>
<SOS> i never shall endure her . <EOS>
<SOS> dear my lord , be not familiar with her . <EOS>
<SOS> fear me not.— she and the duke her husband ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , you speak nobly . <EOS>
<SOS> why is this reasoned ? <EOS>
<SOS> let ’ s then determine with the ancient of war on our proceedings . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall attend you presently at your tent . <EOS>
<SOS> sister , you ’ ll go with us ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> propn most convenient . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , go with us . <EOS>
<SOS> stay till i have read the letter . <EOS>
<SOS> i was forbid it . <EOS>
<SOS> when time shall serve , let but the herald cry , and i ’ ll appear again . <EOS>
<SOS> why , fare thee well . <EOS>
<SOS> i will o'erlook thy paper . <EOS>
<SOS> draw up your powers . <EOS>
<SOS> we will greet the time . <EOS>
<SOS> which of them shall i take ? <EOS>
<SOS> both ? <EOS>
<SOS> one ? <EOS>
<SOS> or neither ? <EOS>
<SOS> neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive . <EOS>
<SOS> to take the widow propn , makes mad her sister propn , and hardly shall i carry out my side , her husband being alive . <EOS>
<SOS> now , then , we ’ ll use his countenance for the battle , which being done , let her who would be rid of him devise his speedy taking off . <EOS>
<SOS> if ever i return to you again , i ’ ll bring you comfort . <EOS>
<SOS> grace go with you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> away , old man . <EOS>
<SOS> give me thy hand . <EOS>
<SOS> away ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn propn hath lost , he and his daughter ta'en . <EOS>
<SOS> give me thy hand . <EOS>
<SOS> come on . <EOS>
<SOS> no further , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> come on . <EOS>
<SOS> and that ’ s true too . <EOS>
<SOS> some officers take them away . <EOS>
<SOS> good guard until their greater pleasures first be known that are to censure them . <EOS>
<SOS> no , no , no , no ! <EOS>
<SOS> come , let ’ s away to prison . <EOS>
<SOS> we two alone will sing like birds i ' th ' cage . <EOS>
<SOS> when thou dost ask me blessing , i ’ ll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness . <EOS>
<SOS> and we ’ ll wear out in a walled prison packs and sects of great ones that ebb and flow by the moon . <EOS>
<SOS> take them away . <EOS>
<SOS> upon such sacrifices , my propn , the gods themselves throw incense . <EOS>
<SOS> have i caught thee ? <EOS>
<SOS> he that parts us shall bring a brand from propn and fire us hence like foxes . <EOS>
<SOS> propn thine eyes . <EOS>
<SOS> the good years shall devour them , flesh and fell , propn they shall make us weep . <EOS>
<SOS> we ’ ll see 'em starve first . <EOS>
<SOS> come . <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , captain . <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll do propn , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> about it , and write “ happy ” when thou ’ st done . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i say , instantly , and carry it so as i have set it down . <EOS>
<SOS> i can not draw a cart , nor eat dried oats . <EOS>
<SOS> if it be man ’ s work , i ’ ll do propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i do require them of you , so to use them as we shall find their merits and our safety may equally determine . <EOS>
<SOS> with him i sent the queen , my reason all the same , and they are ready propn or at further space t ' appear where you shall hold your session . <EOS>
<SOS> the question of propn and her father requires a fitter place . <EOS>
<SOS> i hold you but a subject of this war , not as a brother . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s as we list to grace him . <EOS>
<SOS> not so hot . <EOS>
<SOS> in his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition . <EOS>
<SOS> that were the most if he should husband you . <EOS>
<SOS> that eye that told you so looked but asquint . <EOS>
<SOS> mean you to enjoy him then ? <EOS>
<SOS> nor in thine , lord . <EOS>
<SOS> half - blooded fellow , yes . <EOS>
<SOS> stay yet . <EOS>
<SOS> an interlude ! <EOS>
<SOS> thou art armed , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> let the trumpet sound . <EOS>
<SOS> sick , oh , sick ! <EOS>
<SOS> my sickness grows upon me . <EOS>
<SOS> she is not well . <EOS>
<SOS> convey her to my tent . <EOS>
<SOS> come hither , propn .— let the trumpet propn and read out this . <EOS>
<SOS> sound , trumpet ! <EOS>
<SOS> again ! <EOS>
<SOS> again ! <EOS>
<SOS> what are you ? <EOS>
<SOS> well then , propn propn , i must have your land . <EOS>
<SOS> now , gods , stand up for bastards ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn banished thus ? <EOS>
<SOS> all this done upon the gad ? — edmund , how now ? <EOS>
<SOS> what news ? <EOS>
<SOS> o , know , my name is lost . <EOS>
<SOS> yet am i noble as the adversary i come to cope withal . <EOS>
<SOS> which is that adversary ? <EOS>
<SOS> what ’ s he that speaks for propn , propn of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> himself . <EOS>
<SOS> what sayst thou to him ? <EOS>
<SOS> behold : it is the privilege of mine honors , my oath , and my profession . <EOS>
<SOS> in wisdom i should ask thy name . <EOS>
<SOS> back do i toss these treasons to thy head , with the hell - hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart— <EOS>
<SOS> this is practice , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> by th ' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer an unknown opposite . <EOS>
<SOS> the laws are mine , not thine . <EOS>
<SOS> who can arraign me for propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> most monstrous , oh ! <EOS>
<SOS> ask me not what i know . <EOS>
<SOS> go after her . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s desperate . <EOS>
<SOS> what you have charged me with , that have i done— and more , much more . <EOS>
<SOS> the time will bring it out . <EOS>
<SOS> propn past , and so am i . <EOS>
<SOS> i am no less in blood than thou art , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> if more , the more thou ’ st wronged me . <EOS>
<SOS> my name is propn , and thy father ’ s son . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods are just , and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us . <EOS>
<SOS> propn spoken right . <EOS>
<SOS> propn true . <EOS>
<SOS> i must embrace thee . <EOS>
<SOS> let sorrow split my heart if ever i did hate thee or thy father . <EOS>
<SOS> worthy prince , i know propn . <EOS>
<SOS> where have you hid yourself ? <EOS>
<SOS> how have you known the miseries of your father ? <EOS>
<SOS> list a brief tale , and when ’ tis told , oh , that my heart would burst ! <EOS>
<SOS> the bloody proclamation to escape , that followed me so near — o our lives ' sweetness , <EOS>
<SOS> and in this habit propn i my father with his bleeding rings , their precious stones new lost , became his guide , led him , begged for him , saved him from despair . <EOS>
<SOS> never — o fault ! —revealed myself unto him until some half - hour past , when i was armed . <EOS>
<SOS> but his flawed heart— propn , too weak the conflict to support— ' propn two extremes of passion , joy and grief , propn smilingly . <EOS>
<SOS> this speech of yours hath moved me , and shall perchance do good . <EOS>
<SOS> but speak you on . <EOS>
<SOS> you look as you had something more to say . <EOS>
<SOS> if there be more , more woeful , hold it in . <EOS>
<SOS> for i am almost ready to dissolve , hearing of this . <EOS>
<SOS> this would have seemed a period to such as love not sorrow , but another to amplify too much would make much more and top extremity . <EOS>
<SOS> twice then the trumpets sounded , and there i left him tranced . <EOS>
<SOS> but who was this ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , sir , the banished propn , who in disguise followed his enemy king and did him service propn for a slave . <EOS>
<SOS> help , help , o , help ! <EOS>
<SOS> what kind of help ? <EOS>
<SOS> speak , man . <EOS>
<SOS> what means that bloody knife ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn hot , it smokes . <EOS>
<SOS> it came even from the heart of — oh , she ’ s dead ! <EOS>
<SOS> who dead ? <EOS>
<SOS> speak , man . <EOS>
<SOS> your lady , sir , your lady . <EOS>
<SOS> and her sister by her is poisoned . <EOS>
<SOS> she confesses it . <EOS>
<SOS> i was contracted to them both . <EOS>
<SOS> all three now marry in an instant . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i thought the king had more affected the propn of propn than propn . <EOS>
<SOS> it did always seem so to us . <EOS>
<SOS> but now in the division of the kingdom , it appears not which of the dukes he values most , for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either ’ s moiety . <EOS>
<SOS> his breeding , sir , hath been at my charge . <EOS>
<SOS> i have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now i am brazed to it . <EOS>
<SOS> do you smell a fault ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can not wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper . <EOS>
<SOS> but i have , sir , a son by order of law , some year older than this , who yet is no dearer in my account . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , is this he ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am come to bid my king and master aye good night . <EOS>
<SOS> is he not here ? <EOS>
<SOS> great thing of us propn speak , propn , where ’ s the king ? <EOS>
<SOS> and where propn propn propn thou this object , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , why thus ? <EOS>
<SOS> yet propn was beloved . <EOS>
<SOS> the one the other poisoned for my sake , and after slew herself . <EOS>
<SOS> even so .— cover their faces . <EOS>
<SOS> i pant for life . <EOS>
<SOS> some good i mean to do despite of mine own nature . <EOS>
<SOS> quickly send— be brief in it — to th ' castle , for my writ is on the life of propn and on propn . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , send in time ! <EOS>
<SOS> run , run , o , run ! <EOS>
<SOS> to who , my lord ? — who hath the office ? <EOS>
<SOS> send propn token of reprieve . <EOS>
<SOS> well thought on . <EOS>
<SOS> take my sword . <EOS>
<SOS> the captain— give it the captain . <EOS>
<SOS> haste thee for thy life . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath commission from thy wife and me to hang propn in the prison and to lay the blame upon her own despair , that she fordid herself . <EOS>
<SOS> the gods defend her ! —hear him hence awhile . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , howl , howl , howl ! <EOS>
<SOS> oh , you are men of stones . <EOS>
<SOS> had i your tongues and eyes , i ’ d use them so that propn ’ s vault should crack . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s gone forever . <EOS>
<SOS> i know when one is dead and when one lives . <EOS>
<SOS> she ’ s dead as earth . <EOS>
<SOS> lend me a looking - glass . <EOS>
<SOS> if that her breath will mist or stain the stone , why then , she lives . <EOS>
<SOS> or image of that horror ? <EOS>
<SOS> fall and cease . <EOS>
<SOS> this feather stirs . <EOS>
<SOS> she lives . <EOS>
<SOS> if it be so , it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows that ever i have felt . <EOS>
<SOS> o my good master ! <EOS>
<SOS> prithee , away . <EOS>
<SOS> propn noble propn , your friend . <EOS>
<SOS> a plague upon you , murderers , traitors all ! <EOS>
<SOS> i might have saved her . <EOS>
<SOS> now she ’ s gone for propn propn , propn , stay a little . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn true , my lords , he did . <EOS>
<SOS> did i not , fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> i am old now , and these same crosses spoil me . <EOS>
<SOS> this a dull sight . <EOS>
<SOS> are you not propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> the same . <EOS>
<SOS> your servant propn . <EOS>
<SOS> where is your servant propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s a good fellow , i can tell you that . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s dead and rotten . <EOS>
<SOS> no , my good lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i am the very man— i ’ ll see that straight . <EOS>
<SOS> that from your first of difference and decay have followed your sad steps . <EOS>
<SOS> you ’ re welcome hither . <EOS>
<SOS> nor no man else . <EOS>
<SOS> all ’ s cheerless , dark , and deadly . <EOS>
<SOS> your eldest daughters have fordone themselves , and desperately are dead . <EOS>
<SOS> ay , so i think . <EOS>
<SOS> he knows not what he says , and vain it is that we present us to him . <EOS>
<SOS> edmund is dead , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> for us , we will resign during the life of this old majesty to him our absolute power . <EOS>
<SOS> he faints ! —my lord , my lord ! <EOS>
<SOS> vex not his ghost . <EOS>
<SOS> o , let him pass . <EOS>
<SOS> oh , he is gone indeed . <EOS>
<SOS> the wonder is he hath endured so long . <EOS>
<SOS> bear them from hence . <EOS>
<SOS> our present business is to general woe . <EOS>
<SOS> why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know no news , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> what paper were you reading ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> no ? <EOS>
<SOS> what needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ? <EOS>
<SOS> the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself . <EOS>
<SOS> i beseech you , sir , pardon me . <EOS>
<SOS> it is a letter from my brother that i have not all o'er - read . <EOS>
<SOS> give me the letter , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall offend , either to detain or give it . <EOS>
<SOS> the contents , as in part i understand them , are to blame . <EOS>
<SOS> i hope , for my brother ’ s justification , he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue . <EOS>
<SOS> i have a journey , sir , shortly to go . <EOS>
<SOS> my master calls me . <EOS>
<SOS> i must not say no . <EOS>
<SOS> the weight of this sad time we must obey . <EOS>
<SOS> speak what we feel , not what we ought to say . <EOS>
<SOS> come to me , that of this i may speak more . <EOS>
<SOS> if our father would sleep till i waked him , you should enjoy half his revenue forever , and live the beloved of your brother , propn . ” propn , conspiracy ? <EOS>
<SOS> had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in ? <EOS>
<SOS> when came this to you ? <EOS>
<SOS> who brought it ? <EOS>
<SOS> it was not brought me , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s the cunning of it . <EOS>
<SOS> i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet . <EOS>
<SOS> you know the character to be your brother ’ s ? <EOS>
<SOS> if the matter were good , my lord , i durst swear it were his . <EOS>
<SOS> but in respect of that , i would fain think it were not . <EOS>
<SOS> it is his . <EOS>
<SOS> it is his hand , my lord , but i hope his heart is not in the contents . <EOS>
<SOS> has he never before sounded you in this business ? <EOS>
<SOS> never , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that , sons at perfect age and fathers declined , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue . <EOS>
<SOS> o villain , villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> his very opinion in the letter ! <EOS>
<SOS> abhorred villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> go , sirrah , seek him . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll apprehend him . <EOS>
<SOS> abominable villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> where is he ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do not well know , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger . <EOS>
<SOS> think you so ? <EOS>
<SOS> he can not be such a monster— nor is not , sure . <EOS>
<SOS> to his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn and earth ! <EOS>
<SOS> edmund , seek him out , wind me into him , i pray you . <EOS>
<SOS> i will seek him , sir , presently , convey the business as i shall find means , and acquaint you withal . <EOS>
<SOS> these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us . <EOS>
<SOS> though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects . <EOS>
<SOS> love cools , friendship falls off , brothers divide , in cities <EOS>
<SOS> mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked ’ twixt son and father . <EOS>
<SOS> this villain of mine comes under the prediction — there ’ s son against father . <EOS>
<SOS> the king falls from bias of nature — there ’ s father against child . <EOS>
<SOS> we have seen the best of our time . <EOS>
<SOS> machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves . <EOS>
<SOS> find out this villain , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> it shall lose thee nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> do it carefully .— and the noble and true - hearted propn banished , his offense honesty ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn strange , strange . <EOS>
<SOS> this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune — often the surfeit of our own behavior — we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if we were villains by necessity , fools by heavenly compulsion , knaves , thieves , and treachers by spherical predominance , drunkards , liars , and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence , and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting - on . <EOS>
<SOS> my father compounded with my mother under the dragon ’ s tail and my nativity was under propn propn , so that it follows i am rough and lecherous . <EOS>
<SOS> fut , i should have been that i am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing . <EOS>
<SOS> fa , sol , la , mi . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , brother propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> what serious contemplation are you in ? <EOS>
<SOS> how long have you been a sectary astronomical ? <EOS>
<SOS> come , come . <EOS>
<SOS> when saw you my father last ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , the night gone by . <EOS>
<SOS> spake you with him ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , two hours together . <EOS>
<SOS> parted you in good terms ? <EOS>
<SOS> found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ? <EOS>
<SOS> none at all . <EOS>
<SOS> some villain hath done me wrong . <EOS>
<SOS> that ’ s my fear . <EOS>
<SOS> i pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower . <EOS>
<SOS> and as i say , retire with me to my lodging , from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak . <EOS>
<SOS> pray ye , go . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s my key . <EOS>
<SOS> if you do stir abroad , go armed . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , brother ? <EOS>
<SOS> brother , i advise you to the best . <EOS>
<SOS> go armed . <EOS>
<SOS> pray you , away . <EOS>
<SOS> shall i hear from you anon ? <EOS>
<SOS> i do serve you in this business . <EOS>
<SOS> a credulous father , and a brother noble— whose nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none , on whose foolish honesty my practices ride easy . <EOS>
<SOS> i see the business . <EOS>
<SOS> let me , if not by birth , have lands by wit . <EOS>
<SOS> all with me ’ s meet that i can fashion fit . <EOS>
<SOS> did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> by day and night he wrongs me . <EOS>
<SOS> every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll not endure it . <EOS>
<SOS> his knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us on every trifle . <EOS>
<SOS> when he returns from hunting , i will not speak with him . <EOS>
<SOS> say i am sick . <EOS>
<SOS> if you come slack of former services , you shall do well . <EOS>
<SOS> the fault of it i ’ ll answer . <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s coming , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> i hear him . <EOS>
<SOS> put on what weary negligence you please , you and your fellow servants . <EOS>
<SOS> if he distaste it , let him to our sister , whose mind and mine i know in that are one , not to be overruled . <EOS>
<SOS> idle old man that still would manage those authorities that he hath given away ! <EOS>
<SOS> now by my life , old fools are babes again and must be used with checks as flatteries , when they are seen abused . <EOS>
<SOS> remember what i have said . <EOS>
<SOS> very well , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> and let his knights have colder looks among you . <EOS>
<SOS> what grows of it , no matter . <EOS>
<SOS> advise your fellows so . <EOS>
<SOS> i would breed from hence occasions , and i shall , that i may speak . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll write straight to my sister to hold my very course . <EOS>
<SOS> go , prepare for dinner . <EOS>
<SOS> if but as well i other accents borrow , that can my speech diffuse , my good intent may carry through itself to that full issue for which i razed my likeness . <EOS>
<SOS> now , banished propn , if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned , so may it come thy master , whom thou lovest , shall find thee full of labors . <EOS>
<SOS> let me not stay a jot for dinner . <EOS>
<SOS> go get it ready . <EOS>
<SOS> a man , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> what dost thou profess ? <EOS>
<SOS> what wouldst thou with us ? <EOS>
<SOS> what art thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> a very honest - hearted fellow , and as poor as the king . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou beest as poor for a subject as he ’ s for a king , thou'rt poor enough . <EOS>
<SOS> what wouldst thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> service . <EOS>
<SOS> who wouldst thou serve ? <EOS>
<SOS> you . <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou know me , fellow ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn . <EOS>
<SOS> what services canst thou do ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can keep honest counsel , ride , run , mar a curious tale in telling it , and deliver a plain message bluntly . <EOS>
<SOS> that which ordinary men are fit for , i am qualified in . <EOS>
<SOS> and the best of me is diligence . <EOS>
<SOS> how old art thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> not so young , sir , to love a woman for singing , nor so old to dote on her for anything . <EOS>
<SOS> i have years on my back forty- eight . <EOS>
<SOS> follow me . <EOS>
<SOS> thou shalt serve me . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s my knave , my fool ? — go you , and call my fool hither . <EOS>
<SOS> no , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> my services to your lordship . <EOS>
<SOS> i must love you and sue to know you better . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i shall study deserving . <EOS>
<SOS> he hath been out nine years , and away he shall again . <EOS>
<SOS> the king is coming . <EOS>
<SOS> attend the lords of propn and propn , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> i shall , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> you , you , sirrah , where ’ s my daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> so please you— what says the fellow there ? <EOS>
<SOS> call the clotpoll back . <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s my fool , ho ? <EOS>
<SOS> i think the world ’ s asleep . <EOS>
<SOS> how now ? <EOS>
<SOS> where ’ s that mongrel ? <EOS>
<SOS> he says , my lord , your daughter is not well . <EOS>
<SOS> why came not the slave back to me when i called him . <EOS>
<SOS> propn , he answered me in the roundest manner he would not . <EOS>
<SOS> he would not ? <EOS>
<SOS> my lord , i know not what the matter is , but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wo nt . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also , and your daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn thou so ? <EOS>
<SOS> i beseech you pardon me , my lord , if i be mistaken — for my duty can not be silent when i think your highness wronged . <EOS>
<SOS> thou but rememberest me of mine own conception . <EOS>
<SOS> i have perceived a most faint neglect of late , which i have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness . <EOS>
<SOS> i will look further into propn . <EOS>
<SOS> but where ’ s my fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have not seen him this two days . <EOS>
<SOS> since my young lady ’ s going into propn , sir , the fool hath much pined away . <EOS>
<SOS> no more of that . <EOS>
<SOS> i have noted it well . <EOS>
<SOS> go you and tell my daughter i would speak with her . <EOS>
<SOS> go you , call hither my fool . <EOS>
<SOS> o you sir , you , come you hither , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> who am i , sir ? <EOS>
<SOS> you slave , you cur ! <EOS>
<SOS> i am none of these , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> i beseech your pardon . <EOS>
<SOS> i ’ ll not be strucken , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> now , my friendly knave , i thank thee . <EOS>
<SOS> let me hire him too .— here ’ s my coxcomb . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , my pretty knave ? <EOS>
<SOS> how dost thou ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> for taking one ’ s part that ’ s out of favor . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , thou'lt catch cold shortly . <EOS>
<SOS> there , take my coxcomb . <EOS>
<SOS> why , this fellow has banished two on ’ s daughters , and did the third a blessing against his will . <EOS>
<SOS> if thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb .— how now , nuncle ? <EOS>
<SOS> would i had two coxcombs and two daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> why , my boy ? <EOS>
<SOS> if i gave them all my living , i ’ d keep my coxcombs myself . <EOS>
<SOS> there ’ s mine . <EOS>
<SOS> beg another of thy daughters . <EOS>
<SOS> take heed , sirrah — the whip . <EOS>
<SOS> a pestilent gall to me ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn , i ’ ll teach thee a speech . <EOS>
<SOS> do . <EOS>
<SOS> mark it , nuncle . <EOS>
<SOS> have more than thou showest , speak less than thou knowest , lend less than thou owest , ride more than thou goest , learn more than thou trowest , set less than thou throwest , leave thy drink and thy whore and keep in - a - door , and thou shalt have more than two tens to a score . <EOS>
<SOS> this is nothing , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> then ’ tis like the breath of an propn lawyer . <EOS>
<SOS> why no , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing can be made out of nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> a bitter fool . <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet fool ? <EOS>
<SOS> no , lad . <EOS>
<SOS> teach me . <EOS>
<SOS> that lord that counseled thee to give away thy land , come place him here by me . <EOS>
<SOS> do thou for him stand . <EOS>
<SOS> the sweet and bitter fool will presently appear— the one in motley here , the other found out there . <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou call me fool , boy ? <EOS>
<SOS> all thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with . <EOS>
<SOS> this is not altogether fool , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> no , faith , lords and great men will not let me . <EOS>
<SOS> what two crowns shall they be ? <EOS>
<SOS> why — after i have cut the egg i ' th ' middle and eat up the meat — the two crowns of the egg . <EOS>
<SOS> if i speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so . <EOS>
<SOS> when were you wo nt to be so full of songs , sirrah ? <EOS>
<SOS> i have used it , nuncle , ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers . <EOS>
<SOS> for when thou gavest them the rod , and put ’ st down thine own breeches , prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie . <EOS>
<SOS> i would fain learn to lie . <EOS>
<SOS> an you lie , sirrah , we ’ ll have you whipped . <EOS>
<SOS> i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are . <EOS>
<SOS> they ’ ll have me whipped for speaking true , thou'lt have me whipped for lying , and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace . <EOS>
<SOS> i had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool . <EOS>
<SOS> and yet i would not be thee , nuncle . <EOS>
<SOS> here comes one o ' the parings . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> what makes that frontlet on ? <EOS>
<SOS> methinks you are too much of late i ' th ' frown . <EOS>
<SOS> he that keeps nor crust nor crumb , propn of all , shall want some . <EOS>
<SOS> but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel , breaking forth in rank and not - to - be - endurèd riots . <EOS>
<SOS> which else were shame , that then necessity will call discreet proceeding . <EOS>
<SOS> for you know , nuncle , the hedge - sparrow fed the cuckoo so long , that it ’ s had it head bit off by it young . <EOS>
<SOS> so out went the candle and we were left darkling . <EOS>
<SOS> are you our daughter ? <EOS>
<SOS> does any here know me ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , this is not propn . <EOS>
<SOS> where are his eyes ? <EOS>
<SOS> sure , ’ tis not so . <EOS>
<SOS> who is it that can tell me who i am ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn ’ s shadow . <EOS>
<SOS> which they will make an obedient father . <EOS>
<SOS> this admiration , sir , is much o ' th ' savor of other your new pranks . <EOS>
<SOS> i do beseech you to understand my purposes aright . <EOS>
<SOS> as you are old and reverend , should be wise . <EOS>
<SOS> here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , propn so disordered , so debauched and bold that this our court , infected with their manners , shows like a riotous inn . <EOS>
<SOS> epicurism and lust make it more like a tavern or a brothel than a graced palace . <EOS>
<SOS> the shame itself doth speak for instant remedy . <EOS>
<SOS> darkness and devils ! <EOS>
<SOS> saddle my horses . <EOS>
<SOS> call my train propn propn bastard , i ’ ll not trouble thee . <EOS>
<SOS> yet have i left a daughter . <EOS>
<SOS> you strike my people , and your disordered rabble make servants of their betters . <EOS>
<SOS> woe that too late repents ! — is it your will ? <EOS>
<SOS> ingratitude , thou marble - hearted fiend , more hideous when thou show ’ st thee in a child than the sea monster . <EOS>
<SOS> pray , sir , be patient . <EOS>
<SOS> it may be so , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> hear , nature , hear , dear goddess , hear ! <EOS>
<SOS> dry up in her the organs of increase , and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honor her . <EOS>
<SOS> to thine and propn ’ s issue be this perpetual .— what says our second daughter , our dearest propn , wife of propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> speak . <EOS>
<SOS> now gods that we adore , whereof comes this ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou shalt find that i ’ ll resume the shape which thou dost think i have cast off for ever . <EOS>
<SOS> thou shalt , i warrant thee . <EOS>
<SOS> do you mark that , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> i can not be so partial , propn , to the great love i bear you— pray you , content . <EOS>
<SOS> come , sire , no more .— what , propn , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> a fox when one has caught her and such a daughter should sure to the slaughter , if my cap would buy a halter . <EOS>
<SOS> so the fool follows after . <EOS>
<SOS> this man hath had good counsel — a hundred knights ! <EOS>
<SOS> well , you may fear too far . <EOS>
<SOS> safer than trust too far . <EOS>
<SOS> let me still take away the harms i fear , not fear still to be taken . <EOS>
<SOS> i know his heart . <EOS>
<SOS> what he hath uttered i have writ my sister . <EOS>
<SOS> if she sustain him and his hundred knights when i have showed th ' unfitness— here , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> what , have you writ that letter to my sister ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> take you some company , and away to horse . <EOS>
<SOS> inform her full of my particular fear , and thereto add such reasons of your own as may compact it more . <EOS>
<SOS> get you gone and hasten your return . <EOS>
<SOS> striving to better , oft we mar what ’ s well . <EOS>
<SOS> nay , propn well , well , th ' event . <EOS>
<SOS> i will not sleep , my lord , till i have delivered your letter . <EOS>
<SOS> if a man ’ s brains were in ’ s heels , were propn not in danger of kibes ? <EOS>
<SOS> ay , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> ha , ha , ha ! <EOS>
<SOS> propn see thy other daughter will use thee kindly . <EOS>
<SOS> for though she ’ s as like this as a crab ’ s like an apple , yet i can tell what i can tell . <EOS>
<SOS> why , what canst thou tell , my boy ? <EOS>
<SOS> she will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab . <EOS>
<SOS> thou canst tell why one ’ s nose stands i ' th ' middle on ’ s face ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> why , to keep one ’ s eyes of either side ’ s nose , that what a man can not smell out , he may spy into . <EOS>
<SOS> i did her wrong— propn tell how an oyster makes his shell ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> nor i neither . <EOS>
<SOS> but i can tell why a snail has a house . <EOS>
<SOS> why ? <EOS>
<SOS> why , to put ’ s head in — not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case . <EOS>
<SOS> i will forget my nature . <EOS>
<SOS> so kind a father ! —be my horses ready ? <EOS>
<SOS> thy asses are gone about 'em . <EOS>
<SOS> the reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason . <EOS>
<SOS> because they are not eight ? <EOS>
<SOS> yes indeed . <EOS>
<SOS> thou wouldst make a good fool . <EOS>
<SOS> to take propn again perforce— monster ingratitude ! <EOS>
<SOS> if thou wert my fool , nuncle , i ’ d have thee beaten for being old before thy time . <EOS>
<SOS> how ’ s that ? <EOS>
<SOS> thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise . <EOS>
<SOS> o , let me not be mad , not mad , sweet heaven ! <EOS>
<SOS> keep me in temper . <EOS>
<SOS> i would not be mad . <EOS>
<SOS> ready , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> come , boy . <EOS>
<SOS> save thee , propn . <EOS>
<SOS> and you , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> i have been with your father and given him notice that the propn of propn and propn his duchess will be here with him this night . <EOS>
<SOS> how comes that ? <EOS>
<SOS> nay , i know not . <EOS>
<SOS> have you heard of no likely wars toward propn the two propn of propn and propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> not a word . <EOS>
<SOS> you may do then in time . <EOS>
<SOS> fare you well , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> the duke be here tonight ? <EOS>
<SOS> this weaves itself perforce into my business . <EOS>
<SOS> briefness and fortune , propn propn , a word . <EOS>
<SOS> descend , brother , i say . <EOS>
<SOS> my father watches . <EOS>
<SOS> o sir , fly this place . <EOS>
<SOS> intelligence is given where you are hid . <EOS>
<SOS> have you not spoken ' gainst the propn of propn aught ? <EOS>
<SOS> he ’ s coming hither — now , i ' th ' night , i ' th ' haste , and propn with him . <EOS>
<SOS> advise yourself . <EOS>
<SOS> i hear my father coming . <EOS>
<SOS> pardon me . <EOS>
<SOS> in cunning i must draw my sword upon you . <EOS>
<SOS> now quit you well.— propn , torches ! <EOS>
<SOS> now propn , where ’ s the villain ? <EOS>
<SOS> look , sir , i bleed . <EOS>
<SOS> where is the villain , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> fled this way , sir , when by no means he could— propn him , ho ! <EOS>
<SOS> go after . <EOS>
<SOS> by no means ” what ? <EOS>
<SOS> propn , in fine , seeing how loathly opposite i stood to his unnatural purpose , in fell motion , with his preparèd sword he charges home my unprovided body , latched mine arm . <EOS>
<SOS> and when he saw my best alarumed spirits , propn in the quarrel ’ s right , roused to the encounter , or whether ghasted by the noise i made , full suddenly he fled . <EOS>
<SOS> let him fly far . <EOS>
<SOS> not in this land shall he remain uncaught . <EOS>
<SOS> the noble duke my master , my worthy arch and patron , comes tonight . <EOS>
<SOS> and find i am alone felicitate in your dear highness ' love . <EOS>
<SOS> speak . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing , my lord . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing ? <EOS>
<SOS> nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> nothing will come of nothing . <EOS>
<SOS> speak again . <EOS>
<SOS> unhappy that i am , i can not heave my heart into my mouth . <EOS>
<SOS> i love your majesty according to my bond , no more nor less . <EOS>
<SOS> how , how , propn ? <EOS>
<SOS> mend your speech a little , lest you may mar your fortunes . <EOS>
<SOS> he that conceals him , death . <EOS>
<SOS> he replied , “ thou unpossessing bastard ! <EOS>
<SOS> dost thou think if i would stand against thee , would the reposal of any trust , virtue , or worth in thee make thy words faithed ? <EOS>
<SOS> no . <EOS>
<SOS> what i should deny— as this i would , ay , though thou didst produce my very character — i ’ d turn it all to thy suggestion , plot , and damnèd practice . <EOS>
<SOS> and thou must make a dullard of the world , if they not thought the profits of my death were very pregnant and potential spirits to make thee seek it . ” o strange and fastened villain ! <EOS>
<SOS> would he deny his letter , said he ? <EOS>
<SOS> i never got propn propn , the duke ’ s trumpets . <EOS>
<SOS> i know not why he comes . <EOS>
<SOS> all ports i ’ ll bar . <EOS>
<SOS> the villain shall not ’ scape . <EOS>
<SOS> the duke must grant me that . <EOS>
<SOS> how now , my noble friend ? <EOS>
<SOS> since i came hither , which i can call but now , i have heard strange news . <EOS>
<SOS> how dost , my lord ? <EOS>
<SOS> o madam , my old heart is cracked , it ’ s cracked . <EOS>
<SOS> o , lady , lady , shame would have it hid . <EOS>
<SOS> was he not companion with the riotous knights that tend upon my father ? <EOS>
<SOS> i know not , madam . <EOS>
<SOS> propn too bad , too bad . <EOS>
<SOS> yes , madam , he was of that consort . <EOS>
<SOS> no marvel then , though he were ill affected . <EOS>
<SOS> propn they have put him on the old man ’ s death , to have th ' expense and spoil of his revenues . <EOS>
<SOS> i have this present evening from my sister been well informed of them — and with such cautions that if they come to sojourn at my house i ’ ll not be there . <EOS>
<SOS> nor i , assure thee , propn propn , i hear that you have shown your father a childlike office . <EOS>
<SOS> it was my duty , sir . <EOS>
<SOS> he did bewray his practice , and received this hurt you see striving to apprehend him . <EOS>
<SOS> is he pursued ? <EOS>
