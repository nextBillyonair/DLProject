i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak ’ st .
yet if thou say propn lives , is well , or friends with propn , or not captive to him , i ’ ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail propn pearls upon thee .
propn , he ’ s well .
well said .
and friends with propn .
th ’ art an honest man .
propn and he are greater friends than ever .
make thee a fortune from me .
but yet , madam— i do not like “ but yet . ” it does allay the good precedence .
propn upon “ but yet . ” “ but yet ” is as a jailer to bring forth some monstrous malefactor .
prithee , friend , pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , the good and bad together .
he ’ s friends with propn , in state of health , thou propn , and , thou say ’ st , free .
free , madam , no .
i made no such report .
he ’ s bound unto propn .
for what good turn ?
for the best turn i ’ th ’ bed .
i am pale , propn .
propn , he ’ s married to propn .
the most infectious pestilence upon thee !
good madam , patience .
what say you ?
hence , horrible villain , or i ’ ll spurn thine eyes like balls before me !
i ’ ll unhair thy head !
thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , smarting in ling ’ ring pickle !
say propn not so , a province i will give thee and make thy fortunes proud .
the blow thou hadst shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , and i will boot thee with what gift beside propn modesty can beg .
he ’ s married , madam .
propn , thou hast lived too long .
nay then , i ’ ll run .
what mean you , madam ?
i have made no fault .
good madam , keep yourself within yourself .
the man is innocent .
some innocents ’ scape not the thunderbolt .
propn propn into propn , and kindly creatures turn all to serpents .
call the slave again .
though i am mad , i will not bite him .
call !
he is afeard to come .
i will not hurt him .
these hands do lack nobility that they strike a meaner than myself , since i myself have given myself the cause .
come hither , sir .
though it be honest , it is never good to bring bad news .
give to a gracious message an host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt .
i have done my duty .
is he married ?
the gods confound thee !
dost thou hold there still ?
should i lie , madam ?
go , get thee hence .
i crave your highness ’ pardon .
he is married ?
take no offense that i would not offend you .
to punish me for what you make me do seems much unequal .
he ’ s married to propn .
oh , that his fault should make a knave of thee , that art not what th ’ art sure of !
get thee hence .
the merchandise which thou hast brought from propn are all too dear for me .
lie they upon thy hand and be undone by ’ em !
good your highness , patience .
in praising propn , i have dispraised propn .
many times , madam .
i am paid for propn now .
lead me from hence .
o propn , propn !
propn no matter.— go to the fellow , good propn .
bid him propn the feature of propn : her years , her inclination .
let him not leave out the color of her hair .
bring me word how tall she is .
lead me to my chamber .
propn propn , sweet propn , most anything propn , almost most absolute propn , where ’ s the soothsayer that you praised so to propn propn ?
oh that i knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands !
i make not , but foresee .
pray , then , foresee me one .
no , you shall paint when you are old .
wrinkles forbid !
vex not his prescience .
be attentive .
hush !
you shall be more beloving than beloved .
most meet that first we come to words , and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent , which , if thou hast considered , let us know if ’ twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to propn much tall youth that else must perish here .
what was propn that moved pale propn to conspire ?
take your time .
thou canst not fear us , propn , with thy sails .
we ’ ll speak with thee at sea .
at land , thou know ’ st how much we do o ’ ercount thee .
at land indeed thou dost o ’ ercount me of my father ’ s house , but since the cuckoo builds not for himself , propn in propn as thou mayst .
be pleased to tell us— for this is from the present — how you take the offers we have sent you .
there ’ s the point .
which do not be entreated to , but weigh what it is worth embraced .
you have made me offer of propn , propn .
and i must rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send measures of wheat to propn .
this ’ greed upon to part with unhacked edges and bear back our targes undinted .
that ’ s our offer .
know then i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer , but propn propn put me to some impatience .
let me have your hand .
i did not think , sir , to have met you here .
the beds i ’ propn propn are soft , and thanks to you , that called me timelier than my purpose hither , for i have gained by propn .
well , i know not what counts harsh propn casts upon my face , but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal .
well met here .
i hope so , propn .
thus we are agreed .
that ’ s the next to do .
we ’ ll feast each other ere we part , and let ’ s propn lots who shall begin .
that will i , propn .
no , propn , take the lot .
but , first or last , your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame .
i have heard that propn propn grew fat with feasting there .
you have heard much .
i have fair meanings , sir .
and fair words to them .
then so much have i heard .
and i have heard propn carried— what , i pray you ?
how propn thou , soldier ?
well , and well am like to do , for i perceive , four feasts are toward .
let me shake thy hand .
i never hated thee .
i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behavior .
propn , i never loved you much , but i propn praised ye when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did .
enjoy thy plainness .
it nothing ill becomes thee.— aboard my galley i invite you all .
will you lead , lords ?
propn propn the way , sir .
come .
at sea , i think .
we have , sir .
you have done well by water .
and you by land .
i will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what i have done by land .
nor what i have done by water .
yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
and you by land .
there i deny my land service .
but give me your hand , propn .
if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
all men ’ s faces are true , whatsome ’ er their hands are .
but there is never a fair woman has a true face .
no slander .
they steal hearts .
we came hither to fight with you .
for my part , i am sorry it is turned to a drinking .
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune .
if he do , sure he can not weep propn back again .
you ’ ve said , sir .
we looked not for propn propn here .
pray you , is he married to propn ?
propn ’ s sister is called propn .
true , sir .
she was the wife of propn propn .
but she is now the wife of propn propn .
pray propn , sir ?
propn true .
then is propn and he forever knit together .
if i were bound to divine of this unity , i would not prophesy so .
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
i think so too .
but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity .
propn is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
who would not have his wife so ?
not he that himself is not so , which is propn propn .
he will to his egyptian dish again .
then shall the sighs of propn blow the fire up in propn , and , as i said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
propn will use his affection where it is .
he married but his occasion here .
and thus it may be .
come , sir , will you aboard ?
i have a health for you .
i shall take it , sir .
we have used our throats in propn .
come , let ’ s away .
here they ’ ll be , man .
some o ’ their plants are ill - rooted already .
propn is high - colored .
they have made him drink alms - drink .
i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave .
thus do they , sir : they take the flow propn propn propn by certain scales i ’ propn propn .
they know by propn height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth or foison follow .
the higher propn swells the more it promises .
as it ebbs , the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , and shortly comes to harvest .
you ’ ve strange serpents there ?
ay , propn .
your serpent of propn is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun .
i am not so well as i should be , but i ’ ll ne ’ er out .
not till you have slept .
i fear me you ’ ll be in till then .
nay , certainly , i have heard the ptolemies ’ pyramises are very goodly things .
without contradiction i have heard that .
what manner o ’ thing is your crocodile ?
it is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth .
it is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs .
of it own color too .
propn a strange serpent .
propn so .
and the tears of it are wet .
the matter ?
i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
thou hast served me with much faith .
what ’ s else to say ? — these quicksands , propn , keep off them , for you sink .
what sayst thou ?
wilt thou be lord of the whole world ?
that ’ s twice .
how should that be ?
nay , hear him .
good now , some excellent fortune !
let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all .
oh , excellent !
then belike my children shall have no names .
prithee , how many boys and wenches must i have ?
if every of your wishes had a womb , and fertile every wish , a million .
you think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
we ’ ll know all our fortunes .
mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be — drunk to bed .
propn thou drunk well ?
no , propn , i have kept me from the cup .
show me which way .
these three world - sharers , these competitors , are in thy vessel .
all there is thine .
ah , this thou shouldst have done and not have spoke on propn !
in me ’ tis villainy , in thee propn had been good service .
propn must know , ’ tis not my profit that does lead mine honor ; mine honor , it .
repent that e ’ er thy tongue propn so betrayed thine act .
being done unknown , i should have found it afterwards well done , but must condemn it now .
desist , and drink .
this health to propn !
here ’ s to thee , propn !
enobarbus , welcome .
there ’ s a strong fellow , propn .
why ?
he bears the third part of the world , man .
seest not ?
the third part , then , is drunk .
drink thou .
come .
this is not yet an alexandrian feast .
it ripens towards it .
strike the vessels , ho !
here ’ s to propn .
i could well forbear propn .
be a child propn th ’ time .
but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one .
let ’ s ha propn , good soldier .
come , let ’ s all take hands propn that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate propn .
all take hands .
what needs more words ?
good night .
and shall , sir .
give ’ s your hand .
we are friends .
come , down into the boat .
take heed you fall not .
propn , i ’ ll not on shore .
no , to my cabin .
what !
there ’ s my cap .
propn !
noble captain , come .
now , darting propn , art thou struck , and now pleased fortune does of propn propn death make me revenger .
for learn this , propn : better to leave undone than by our deed propn too high a fame when him we serve ’ s away .
propn and propn have ever won more in their officer than person .
who does i ’ th ’ wars more than his captain can becomes his captain ’ s captain ; and ambition , the soldier ’ s virtue , rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him .
i could do more to do antonius good , but propn offend him , and in his offense should my performance perish .
thou hast , propn , that without the which a soldier and his sword propn scarce distinction .
thou wilt write to propn ?
i ’ ll humbly signify what in his name , that magical word of war , we have effected : how with his banners and his well - paid ranks the propn - yet - beaten horse of propn we have jaded out propn th ’ field .
where is he now ?
what , are the brothers parted ?
they have dispatched with propn ; he is gone .
octavia weeps to part from propn .
propn is sad , and propn , since propn ’ s feast , as propn says , is troubled with the greensickness .
a very fine one .
oh , how he loves propn !
nay , but how dearly he adores propn propn !
propn ?
what ’ s propn ?
the god of propn .
spake you of propn ?
how , the nonpareil !
o antony , o thou arabian bird !
would you praise propn , say “ propn . ” go no further .
indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
but he loves propn best ; yet he loves propn .
propn !
hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not think , speak , cast , write , sing , number — hoo ! — his love to propn .
both he loves .
they are his shards , and he
so , this is to horse .
propn , noble propn .
good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
no further , sir .
for better might we have loved without this mean , if on both parts this be not cherished .
make me not offended in your distrust .
i have said .
you shall not find , though you be therein curious , the least cause for what you seem to fear .
so the gods keep you and make the hearts of propn serve your ends .
we will here part .
propn , my dearest sister , fare thee well .
the elements be kind to thee and make propn spirits all of comfort !
fare thee well .
my noble brother !
the propn propn in her eyes ; it is love ’ s spring , and these the showers to bring it on .
what , propn ?
i ’ ll tell you in your ear .
look , here i have you .
thus i let you go and give you to the gods .
propn .
be happy .
propn , farewell .
propn .
e ’ en as the o ’ erflowing propn presageth famine .
go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay .
nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , i can not scratch mine ear .— prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune .
your fortunes are alike .
but how , but how ?
give me particulars .
i have said .
am i not an inch of fortune better than she ?
well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than i , where would you choose it ?
not in my husband ’ s nose .
our worser thoughts heavens mend .
alexas !
for , as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose - wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded .
therefore , dear propn , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly .
where is the fellow ?
half afeard to come .
go to , go to .— come hither , sir .
good majesty , propn of propn dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased .
that propn ’ s head i ’ ll have !
most gracious majesty !
propn thou behold propn ?
ay , dread propn .
where ?
propn , in propn .
i looked her in the face , and saw her led between her brother and propn propn .
is she as tall as me ?
she is not , madam .
propn hear her speak ?
is she shrill - tongued or low ?
propn , i heard her speak .
she is low - voiced .
that ’ s not so good .
he can not like her long .
like her ?
o propn , ’ tis impossible .
i think so , propn .
she creeps .
she shows a body rather than a life , a statue than a breather .
is this certain ?
or i have no observance .
three in propn can not make better note .
there ’ s nothing in her yet .
the fellow has good judgment .
excellent .
propn , hark .
and i do think she ’ s thirty .
propn thou her face in mind ?
is ’ t long or round ?
round , even to faultiness .
for the most part , too , they are foolish that are so .
her hair , what color ?
propn , madam , and her forehead as low as she would wish it .
propn must not take my former sharpness ill .
i will employ thee back again ; i find thee most fit for business .
go make thee ready ; our letters are prepared .
a proper man .
indeed , he is so .
i repent me much that so i harried him .
nothing , madam .
all may be well enough .
i warrant you , madam .
o my good lord , believe not all , or , if you must believe , propn not all .
a more unhappy lady , if this division chance , propn stood between , praying for both parts .
propn propn , let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it .
the meantime , lady , i ’ ll raise the preparation of a war propn stain your brother .
the propn of power make me most weak , most weak , your reconciler !
when it appears to you where this begins , turn your displeasure that way , for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them .
provide your going ; choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to .
how now , friend propn !
there ’ s strange news come , sir .
what , man ?
propn and propn have made wars upon propn .
this is old .
what is the success ?
so the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , and throw between them all the food thou hast , they ’ ll grind the one the other .
where ’ s propn ?
more , propn : my lord desires you presently .
my news i might have told hereafter .
propn be naught , but let it be .
bring me to propn .
come , sir .
contemning propn , he has done all this and more in propn .
here ’ s the manner of propn : propn th ’ marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , propn and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned .
this in the public eye ?
she in th ’ habiliments of the goddess propn that day appeared , and oft before gave audience , as ’ tis reported , so .
let propn be thus informed .
who , queasy with his insolence already , will their good thoughts call from him .
the people knows it , and have now received his accusations .
who does he accuse ?
propn , and that , having in propn propn propn spoiled , we had not rated him his part propn th ’ isle .
then does he say he lent me some shipping , unrestored .
propn , this should be answered .
propn done already , and the messenger gone .
i have told him , propn was grown too cruel , that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change .
he ’ ll never yield to that .
nor must not then be yielded to in this .
propn , propn , and my lord !
propn , most dear propn !
that ever i should call thee castaway !
you have not called me so , nor have you cause .
why have you stol ’ n upon us thus ?
you come not like propn ’ s sister .
the wife of propn should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach propn ere she did appear .
nay , the dust should have ascended to the roof of propn , raised by your populous troops .
we should have met you by sea and land , supplying every stage with an augmented greeting .
my lord , propn propn , hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted my grievèd ear withal , whereon i begged his pardon for return .
which soon he granted , being an obstruct ’ tween his lust and him .
amen .
hush !
here comes propn .
saw you my lord ?
no , lady .
was he not here ?
no , madam .
he was disposed to mirth , but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him .— propn !
propn ?
here at your service .
my lord approaches .
propn thy wife first came into the field .
against my brother propn ?
ay .
do not say so , my lord .
where is he now ?
my lord , in propn .
no , my most wrongèd sister .
propn propn nodded him to her .
he hath given his empire up to a whore ; who now are levying the kings propn th ’ earth for war .
he hath assembled propn , the propn of propn ; propn , of propn ; propn , propn of propn ; the thracian king , propn ; propn propn of propn ; propn of propn ; propn of propn ; propn , propn of propn ; propn and propn , the kings of propn and propn , with a more larger list of scepters .
ay me , most wretched , that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that does afflict each other !
welcome hither .
your letters did withhold our breaking forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger .
cheer your heart .
best of comfort , and ever welcome to us .
welcome , lady .
welcome , dear madam .
each heart in propn does love and pity you .
only th ’ adulterous propn , most large in his abominations , turns you off and gives his potent regiment to a trull that noises it against us .
most certain .
sister , welcome .
pray you be ever known to patience .
my dear ’ st sister !
but why , why , why ?
thou hast forspoke my being in these wars and sayst it is not fit .
is propn not denounced against us ?
why should not we be there in person ?
what is ’ t you say ?
propn propn !
and their tongues rot that speak against us !
a charge we bear propn th ’ war , and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man .
speak not against it .
i will not stay behind .
nay , i have done .
here comes the propn .
is it not strange , propn , that from propn and propn he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in propn ? — you have heard on propn , sweet ?
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent .
by sea , what else ?
why will my lord do so ?
for that he dares us to propn .
so hath my lord dared him to single fight .
ay , and to wage this battle at propn , where propn fought with propn .
but these offers , which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , and so should you .
in propn ’ s fleet are those that often have propn propn fought .
their ships are yare , yours , heavy .
no disgrace propn fall you for refusing him at sea , being prepared for land .
i ’ ll fight at sea .
but if we fail , we then can do propn at land .
thy business ?
the news is true , my lord .
he is descried .
propn , our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , and our twelve thousand horse .
how now , worthy soldier ?
o noble propn , do not fight by sea !
trust not to rotten planks .
do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds ?
let propn propn and the propn go a - ducking .
we have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot .
well , well , away .
by propn , i think i am i ’ th ’ right .
soldier , thou art ; but his whole action grows not in the power on propn .
so our leader propn led , and we are women ’ s men .
you keep by land the legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
propn propn , propn propn , propn , and propn , are for sea ; but we keep whole by land .
this speed of propn propn propn beyond belief .
while he was yet in propn his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies .
who ’ s his lieutenant , hear you ?
they say , one propn .
well i know the man .
the propn calls propn .
with news the time propn with labor , and throws forth each minute some .
propn !
my lord ?
strike not by land ; keep whole .
provoke not battle till we have done at sea .
our fortune lies upon this jump .
set we our squadrons on yond side propn propn hill , in eye of propn ’ s battle , from which place we may the number of the ships behold and so proceed accordingly .
i can behold no longer .
gods and goddesses , all the whole synod of them !
what ’ s thy passion ?
the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance .
we have kissed away kingdoms and provinces .
how appears the fight ?
propn ribaudred nag of propn propn leprosy o ’ ertake ! —i ’ th ’ midst propn propn fight , when vantage like a pair of twins appeared both as the same , or rather ours the elder , the breeze upon her , like a cow in propn , propn sails and flies .
that i beheld .
mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view .
well , what worst ?
the nature of bad news infects the teller .
when it concerns the fool or coward .
on .
things that are past are done , with me .
propn thus : who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , i hear him as he flattered .
o my lord !
speak to me home .
name propn as she is called in propn .
oh , then we bring forth weeds when our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us is as our earing .
fare thee well awhile .
i never saw an action of such shame .
experience , manhood , honor , propn before did violate so itself .
alack , alack !
our fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably .
had our general been what he knew himself , it had gone well .
oh , he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own !
ay , are you thereabouts ?
why then , good night indeed .
toward propn are they fled .
to propn will i render my legions and my horse .
propn .
friends , come hither .
i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way forever .
i have a ship propn with gold .
fly and make your peace with propn .
fly ?
not we .
i have fled myself , and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders .
friends , begone .
i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you .
propn .
oh , i followed that i blush to look upon !
my very hairs do mutiny , for the white propn the brown for rashness , and they them for fear and doting .
friends , begone .
you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you .
pray you , look not sad , nor make replies of loathness .
take the hint which my despair proclaims .
let that be left which leaves itself .
to the seaside straightway !
i will possess you of that ship and treasure .
leave me , i pray , a little .
pray you now , nay , do so , for indeed i have lost command .
why , what else ?
let me sit down .
oh , fie , fie , fie !
propn !
propn , o good propn !
the propn , my lord , the propn .
go to him , madam , speak to him .
he is unqualitied with very shame .
well then , sustain me .
most noble sir , arise .
the propn approaches .
her head propn declined , and death will seize her but your comfort makes the rescue .
i have offended reputation , a most unnoble swerving .
propn , the propn .
oh , whither hast thou led me , propn ?
o my lord , my lord , forgive my fearful sails !
i little thought you would have followed .
propn , thou knew ’ st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th ’ strings , and thou shouldst tow me after .
o ’ er my spirit propn full supremacy thou knew ’ st , and that propn beck might from the bidding of the gods command me .
oh , my pardon !
now i must to the young man send humble treaties , dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness , who with half the bulk propn th ’ world played as i pleased , making and marring fortunes .
you did know how much you were my conqueror , and that my sword , made weak by my affection , would obey it on all cause .
fall not a tear , i say .
one of them rates all that is won and lost .
give me a kiss .
even this repays me.— we sent our schoolmaster .
let him appear that ’ s come from propn .
know you him ?
approach and speak .
such as i am , i come from propn .
i was of late as petty to his ends as is the morn - dew on the myrtle leaf to his grand sea .
be propn so .
declare thine office .
propn of his fortunes he salutes thee , and requires to live in propn ; which not granted , he lessens his requests , and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth a private man in propn .
this for him .
next , propn does confess thy greatness , submits her to thy might , and of thee craves the circle of the propn for her heirs , now hazarded to thy grace .
for propn , i have no ears to his request .
the propn of audience nor desire shall fail , so she from propn drive her all - disgracèd friend or take his life there .
this if she perform , she shall not sue unheard .
so to them both .
fortune pursue thee !
bring him through the bands .
propn , i go .
observe how propn becomes his flaw , and what thou think ’ st his very action speaks in every power that moves .
propn , i shall .
what shall we do , propn ?
think and die .
is propn or we in fault for this ?
propn only , that would make his will propn of his reason .
why should he follow ?
the itch of his affection should not then have nicked his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed , he being the merèd question .
twas a shame no less than was his loss , to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing .
prithee , peace .
is that his answer ?
ay , my lord .
the propn shall then have courtesy , so she will yield us up ?
he says so .
let her know ’ t.— and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities .
that head , my lord ?
a messenger from propn .
what , no more ceremony ?
see , my women , against the blown rose may they stop their nose , that kneeled unto the buds .— admit him , sir .
at your noble pleasure .
he stays upon your will .
what are you ?
fulvia thy wife is dead .
where died she ?
in propn .
her length of sickness , with what else more serious propn thee to know , this bears .
forbear me .
propn ’ s will ?
hear it apart .
none but friends .
say boldly .
so haply are they friends to propn .
he needs as many , sir , as propn has , or needs not us .
if propn please , our master will leap to be his friend .
for us , you know whose he is we are , and that is propn propn .
propn thus then , thou most renowned : propn entreats not to consider in what case thou stand ’ st , further than he is propn .
he knows that you embrace not propn as you did love , but as you feared him .
oh !
he is a god and knows what is most right .
mine honor was not yielded , but conquered merely .
shall i say to propn what you require of him ?
for he partly begs to be desired to give .
it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon .
but it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left propn and put yourself under his shroud , the universal landlord .
what ’ s your name ?
my name is propn .
most kind messenger , say to great propn this in deputation : i kiss his conqu ’ ring hand .
tell him i am prompt to lay my crown at ’ s feet , and there to kneel .
favors ?
by propn that thunders !
what art thou , fellow ?
you will be whipped .
take hence this jack and whip him .
moon and stars !
whip him .
were propn twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge propn , should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here — what ’ s her name since she was propn ?
whip him , fellows , till like a boy , you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy .
take him hence .
this jack of propn ’ s shall bear us an errand to him .
good my lord— you have been a boggler ever .
but when we in our viciousness grow hard— oh , misery on ’ t ! —the wise gods seel our eyes , in our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us adore our errors , laugh at ’ s while we strut to our confusion .
oh , is propn come to this ?
i found you as a morsel cold upon propn propn ’ s trencher .
nay , you were a fragment of propn propn propn , besides what hotter hours , unregistered in vulgar fame , you have luxuriously picked out .
for i am sure , though you can guess what temperance should be , you know not what it is .
propn is this ?
soundly , my lord .
cried he ?
and begged he pardon ?
he did ask favor .
have you done yet ?
propn , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , and it portends alone the fall of propn .
to flatter propn , would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points ?
not know me yet ?
coldhearted toward me ?
ah , dear , if i be so , from my cold heart let propn engender hail , and poison it in the source , and the first stone propn in my neck .
as it determines , so dissolve my life !
the next propn smite , till by degrees the memory of my womb , together with my brave propn all , by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of propn have buried them for prey !
i am satisfied .
propn sits down in propn , where i will oppose his fate .
our force by land propn nobly held .
our severed navy too have knit again , and fleet , threat ’ ning most sealike .
where hast thou been , my heart ?
dost thou hear , lady ?
if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips , i will appear in blood .
i and my sword will earn our chronicle .
there ’ s hope in propn yet .
that ’ s my brave lord !
i will be treble - sinewed , -hearted , -breathed , and fight maliciously .
for when mine hours were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives of me for jests ; but now i ’ ll set my teeth and send to darkness all that stop me .
come , let ’ s have one other gaudy night .
call to me all my sad captains .
let ’ s mock the midnight bell .
it is my birthday .
i had thought t ’ have held it poor ; but since my lord is propn again , i will be propn .
we will yet do well .
do so .
we ’ ll speak to them , and tonight i ’ ll force the wine peep through their scars .— come on , my propn , there ’ s sap in propn yet .
now he ’ ll outstare the lightning .
when valor preys on reason , it eats the sword it fights with .
i will seek some way to leave him .
he calls me “ boy ” and chides as he had power to beat me out of propn .
let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die , meantime propn at his challenge .
give him no breath , but now make boot of his distraction .
never anger made good guard for itself .
let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight .
within our files there are , of those that served propn propn but late , enough to fetch him in .
see it done and feast the army .
we have store to do propn , and they have earned the waste .
poor propn !
what ’ s your pleasure , sir ?
i must with haste from hence .
why , then , we kill all our women .
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them .
if they suffer our departure , death propn the word .
i must be gone .
under a compelling occasion , let women die .
it were pity to cast them away for nothing , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing .
propn , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly .
i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment .
i do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
she is cunning past man propn thought .
we can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears .
he will not fight with me , propn ?
no .
why should he not ?
he thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , he is twenty men to one .
tomorrow , soldier , by sea and land i ’ ll fight .
or i will live or bathe my dying honor in the blood shall make it live again .
woo ’ t thou fight well ?
i ’ ll strike and cry , “ take all . ” well said .
come on !
call forth my household servants .
let ’ s tonight be bounteous at our meal .
you have served me well , and kings have been your fellows .
the gods forbid !
well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
scant not my cups , and make as much of me as when mine empire was your fellow too , and suffered my command .
look , they weep , and i , an ass , am onion - eyed .
ho , ho , ho !
now the witch take me if i meant it thus !
grace grow where those drops fall !
my hearty friends , you take me in too dolorous a sense , for i spake to you for your comfort , did desire you to burn this night with torches .
know , my hearts , i hope well of tomorrow , and will lead you where rather i ’ ll expect victorious life than death and honor .
brother , good night .
tomorrow is the day .
heard you of nothing strange about the streets ?
nothing .
what news ?
propn propn but a rumor .
good night to you .
well , sir , good night .
soldiers , have careful watch .
and you .
here we .
and if tomorrow our navy thrive , i have an absolute hope our landmen will stand up .
propn a brave army , and full of purpose .
peace !
what noise ?
propn !
music i ’ th ’ air .
under the earth .
it signs well , does it not ?
no .
peace , i say !
what should this mean ?
how now , masters ?
ay .
is propn not strange ?
do you hear , masters ?
do you hear ?
follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; let ’ s see how it will give off .
content .
propn strange .
sleep a little .
come , good fellow , put thine iron on .
if fortune be not ours today , it is because we brave her .
come .
nay , i ’ ll help too .
what ’ s this for ?
ah , let be , let be !
thou art the armorer of my heart .
false , false .
this , this .
sooth , la , i ’ ll help .
thus it must be .
well , well , we shall thrive now .— seest thou , my good fellow ?
go put on thy defenses .
propn , sir .
is not this buckled well ?
rarely , rarely .
dispatch .— o love , that thou couldst see my wars today , and knew ’ st the royal occupation !
good morrow to thee .
welcome .
thou look ’ st like him that knows a warlike charge .
to business that we love we rise betimes and go to propn with delight .
a thousand , sir , early though propn be , have on their riveted trim and at the port expect you .
the morn is fair .
good morrow , propn .
good morrow , propn .
propn well blown , lads .
this morning , like the spirit of a youth that means to be of note , begins betimes .
fare thee well , dame .
whate ’ er becomes of me , this is a soldier ’ s kiss .
i ’ ll leave thee now like a man of steel .
lead me .
he goes forth gallantly .
the gods make this a happy day to propn !
would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed to make me fight at land !
propn thou done so , the kings that have revolted , and the soldier that has this morning left thee , would have still followed thy heels .
who ’ s gone this morning ?
who ?
one ever near thee .
propn , he is with propn .
propn , his chests and treasure he has not with him .
is he gone ?
most certain .
go , propn , send his treasure after .
do it .
detain no jot , i charge thee .
write to him— i will subscribe — gentle adieus and greetings .
say that i wish he never find more cause to change a master .
oh , my fortunes have corrupted honest men !
dispatch .— propn !
propn is dead .
propn ?
propn is dead .
propn ?
dead .
why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice .
if there were no more women but propn , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented .
this grief is crowned with consolation .
your old smock brings forth a new petticoat , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
the business she hath broached in the state can not endure my absence .
and the business you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of propn propn , which wholly depends on your abode .
no more light answers .
let our officers have notice what we purpose .
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the propn and get her leave to part .
for not alone the death of propn , with more urgent touches , do strongly speak to us , but the letters too of many our contriving friends in propn petition us at home .
much is breeding which , like the courser ’ s hair , hath yet but life , and not a serpent ’ s poison .
say our pleasure , to such whose place is under us , requires our quick remove from hence .
go forth , propn , and begin the fight .
our will is propn be took alive .
make it so known .
propn , i shall .
the time of universal peace is near .
go charge propn propn those that have revolted in the vant , that propn may seem to spend his fury upon himself .
for this pains propn hath hanged him .
propn and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honorable trust .
i have done ill , of which i do accuse myself so sorely that i will joy no more .
propn , propn propn after thee sent all thy treasure , with his bounty overplus .
the messenger came on my guard , and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules .
i give it you .
propn not , propn .
i tell you true .
best you safed the bringer out of the host .
i must attend mine office , or would have done propn myself .
your emperor continues still a jove .
i am alone the villain of the earth , and feel i am so most .
o antony , thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid my better service , when my turpitude propn dost so crown with gold !
this blows my heart .
if swift thought break it not , a swifter mean propn outstrike thought , but thought will do propn , i feel .
i fight against thee ?
no , i will go seek some ditch wherein to die .
the propn best fits my latter part of life .
propn !
we have engaged ourselves too far .
propn himself has work , and our oppression exceeds what we expected .
o my brave propn , this is fought indeed !
had we done so at first , we had droven them home with clouts about their heads .
thou bleed ’ st apace .
i had a wound here that was like a “ propn , ” but now propn made an “ propn ” they do retire .
we ’ ll beat ’ em into bench - holes .
i have yet propn for six scotches more .
they are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves for a fair victory .
let us score their backs and snatch ’ em up , as we take hares , behind !
propn sport to maul a runner .
i will reward thee once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold for thy good valor .
come thee on .
i ’ ll halt after .
we have beat him to his camp .
run one before and let the propn know of our gests .
tomorrow , before the sun shall see propn , we ’ ll spill the blood that has today escaped .
propn of lords !
o infinite virtue , propn thou smiling from the world ’ s great snare uncaught ?
mine nightingale , we have beat them to their beds .
what , girl , though gray do something mingle with our younger brown , yet propn we a brain that nourishes our nerves and can get goal for goal of youth .
behold this man .
he hath fought today as if a god , in hate of mankind , had destroyed in such a shape .
he has deserved it , were it carbuncled like holy propn car .
if we be not relieved within this hour , we must return to th ’ court of guard .
o bear me witness , night— what man is this ?
stand close and list him .
be witness to me , o thou blessèd moon , when men revolted shall upon record propn hateful memory , poor propn did before thy face repent .
enobarbus ?
peace !
propn further .
throw my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault , which , being dried with grief , will break to powder and finish all foul thoughts .
o antony !
let ’ s speak to him .
let ’ s hear him , for the things he speaks may concern propn .
let ’ s do so .
but he sleeps .
swoons rather , for so bad a prayer as his was never yet for sleep .
go we to him .
propn , sir , awake .
speak to us .
hear you , sir ?
the hand of death hath raught him .
let us bear him to propn court of guard .
he is of note .
our hour is fully out .
come on , then .
he may recover yet .
i shall do propn .
their preparation is today by sea .
we please them not by land .
for both , my lord .
i would they ’ d fight propn th ’ fire or i ’ th ’ air , we ’ d fight there too .
but this it is : our foot upon the hills adjoining to the city shall stay with us .
to the vales , and hold our best advantage .
yet they are not joined .
where yond pine does stand i shall discover all .
i ’ ll bring thee word propn how ’ tis like to go .
swallows have built in propn ’ s sails their nests .
all is lost !
this foul egyptian hath betrayèd me .
triple - turned whore !
bid them all fly , for when i am revenged upon my charm , i have done all .
bid them all fly .
begone !
o sun , thy uprise shall i see no more .
propn and propn part here .
even here do we shake hands .
all come to this ?
betrayed i am .
oh , this false soul of propn !
ah , thou spell !
propn !
why is my lord enraged against his love ?
propn , or i shall give thee thy deserving , and blemish propn ’ s triumph .
let him take thee and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians !
follow his chariot , like the greatest spot of all thy sex .
most monsterlike be shown for poor ’ st diminutives , for dolts , and let propn propn plow thy visage up with her preparèd nails !
she dies for propn .— propn , ho !
help me , my women !
to th ’ monument !
there lock yourself and send him word you are dead .
the soul and body rive not more in parting than greatness going off .
say that the last i spoke was “ propn , ” and word it , prithee , piteously .
hence , mardian , and bring me how he takes my death .
eros , thou yet behold ’ st me ?
ay , noble lord .
thou hast seen these signs .
ay , my lord .
that which is now a horse , even with a thought the rack dislimns and makes it indistinct as water is in water .
it does , my lord .
my good knave propn , now thy captain is even such a body .
here i am propn , yet can not hold this visible shape , my knave .
nay , weep not , gentle propn .
oh , thy vile lady !
she has robbed me of my sword .
hence , saucy eunuch !
peace !
she hath betrayed me and shall die the death .
death of one person can be paid but once , and that she has discharged .
what thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand .
the last she spake was “ propn , most noble propn ! ” then in the midst a tearing groan did break the name of propn .
it was divided between her heart and lips .
she rendered life , propn name so buried in her .
dead , then ?
dead .
propn , propn .
go .
off , pluck off !
o , cleave , my sides !
heart , once be stronger than thy continent .
crack thy frail case ! —apace , propn , apace .
no more a soldier .
bruisèd pieces , go .
you have been nobly borne .
i will o ’ ertake thee , propn , and weep for my pardon .
since the torch is out , lie down and stray no farther .
now all labor propn what it does .
yea , very force entangles itself with strength .
seal then , and all is done.— propn come , my queen .— eros ! —stay for me .
where souls do couch on flowers , we ’ ll hand in hand , and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze .
dido and her propn shall want troops , and all the haunt be ours .— come , propn , propn !
what would my lord ?
since propn died i have lived in such dishonor that the gods detest my baseness .
do propn .
the time is come .
thou strik ’ st not me , propn propn thou defeat ’ st .
put color in thy cheek .
the gods withhold me !
shall i do that which all the parthian darts , though enemy , lost aim and could not ?
propn , propn thou be windowed in great propn and see propn master thus with pleached arms , bending down his corrigible neck , his face subdued to penetrative shame , whilst the wheeled seat of fortunate propn , drawn before him , branded his baseness that ensued ?
i would not see propn .
draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn most useful for thy country .
o sir , pardon me !
when i did make thee free , swor ’ st thou not then to do this when i bade thee ?
do it at once , or thy precedent services are all but accidents unpurposed .
draw and come .
turn from me then that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
propn thee !
where is he ?
i did not see him since .
what should i do i do not ?
in each thing give him way .
cross him in nothing .
tempt him not so too far .
i wish , forbear .
in time we hate that which we often fear .
but here comes propn .
i am sick and sullen .
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— help me away , dear propn !
i shall fall .
my sword is drawn .
my dear master , my captain , and my emperor , let me say , before i strike this bloody stroke , farewell .
propn said , man , and farewell .
propn , great chief .
shall i strike now ?
now , propn .
why , there then !
thus i do escape the sorrow of propn ’ s death .
my queen and eros have by their brave instruction got upon me a nobleness in record .
to do thus i learned of thee .
how !
not dead ?
oh , dispatch me !
what ’ s the noise ?
i have done my work ill , friends .
oh , make an end of what i have begun !
the star is fall ’ n .
and time is at his period .
alas , and woe !
let him that loves me strike me dead .
not i .
nor i .
nor anyone .
propn death and fortunes bid thy followers fly .
this sword but shown to propn , with this tidings , shall enter me with him .
where ’ s propn ?
there , propn , there .
lives he ?
wilt thou not answer , man ?
art thou there , propn ?
draw thy sword and give me propn strokes for death .
most absolute lord , my mistress propn sent me to thee .
when did she send thee ?
now , my lord .
where is she ?
locked in her monument .
she had a prophesying fear of what hath come to pass .
for when she saw— which never shall be found — you did suspect she had disposed with propn , and that your rage would not be purged , she sent you word she was dead .
too late , good propn .
call my guard , i prithee .
what ho , the propn ’ s guard !
bear me , good friends , where propn bides .
propn the last service that i shall command you .
woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear all your true followers out .
most heavy day !
nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate to grace it with your sorrows .
bid that welcome which comes to punish us , and we punish it , seeming to bear it lightly .
take me up .
i have led you oft ; carry me now , good friends , and have my thanks for all .
o propn , i will never go from hence .
be comforted , dear madam .
no , i will not .
all strange and terrible events are welcome , but comforts we despise .
our size of sorrow , proportioned to our cause , must be as great as that which makes it .
how now ?
is he dead ?
his death ’ s upon him , but not dead .
o propn , propn , propn !
help , propn , help , propn , help !
peace !
not propn ’ s valor hath o ’ erthrown propn , but propn ’ s hath triumphed on itself .
so it should be , that none but propn should conquer propn , but woe ’ tis so !
nay , but this dotage of our general propn o ’ erflows the measure .
those his goodly eyes , that o ’ er the files and musters of the war have glowed like plated propn , now bend , now turn the office and devotion of their view upon a tawny front .
his captain ’ s heart , which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst the buckles on his breast , reneges all temper and is become the bellows and the fan to cool a gypsy ’ s lust .
look where they come .
take but good note , and you shall see in him the triple pillar of the world transformed into a strumpet ’ s fool .
behold and see .
if it be love indeed , tell me how much .
there ’ s beggary in the love that can be reckoned .
i ’ ll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
then must thou needs find out new propn , new earth .
news , my good lord , from propn .
i am dying , propn , dying .
only i here importune death awhile , until of many thousand kisses the poor last i lay upon thy lips .
i dare not , dear , dear my lord , pardon , i dare not , propn i be taken .
not th ’ imperious show of the full - fortuned propn ever shall be brooched with me .
if knife , drugs , serpents , have propn , sting , or operation , i am safe .
your wife propn , with her modest eyes and still conclusion , shall acquire no honor demuring upon me .
assist , good friends .
oh , quick , or i am gone .
here ’ s sport indeed !
how heavy weighs my lord !
had i great propn ’ s power , the strong - winged propn should fetch thee up and set thee by propn ’ s side .
and welcome , welcome !
die when thou hast lived .
had my lips that power , thus would i wear them out .
a heavy sight !
i am dying , propn , dying .
give me some wine and let me speak a little .
my resolution and my hands i ’ ll trust , none about propn .
now my spirit is going .
i can no more .
propn of men , woo ’ t die ?
propn thou no care of me ?
shall i abide in this dull world , which in thy absence is no better than a sty ?
my lord !
oh , withered is the garland of the war .
the soldier ’ s pole is fall ’ n !
young boys and girls are level now with men .
the odds is gone , and there is nothing left remarkable propn the visiting moon .
she ’ s dead too , our sovereign .
propn !
propn !
o madam , madam , madam !
royal propn , propn !
peace , peace , propn .
no more but propn a woman , and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares .
all ’ s but naught .
how do you , women ?
what , what , good cheer !
why , how now , propn ?
my noble girls !
good sirs , take heart .
we ’ ll bury him , and then , what ’ s brave , what ’ s noble , let ’ s do propn after the high roman fashion and make death proud to take us .
come , away .
this case of that huge spirit now is cold .
ah , women , women !
come .
we have no friend but resolution , and the briefest end .
go to him , propn , bid him yield .
being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks the pauses that he makes .
propn , i shall .
propn is that ?
and what art thou that propn appear thus to us ?
i am called propn .
propn propn i served , who best was worthy best to be served .
whilst he stood up and spoke , he was my master , and i wore my life to spend upon his haters .
if thou pleasest not , i yield thee up my life .
what is propn thou say ’ st ?
i say , o propn , propn is dead .
the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack .
the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens .
the death of propn is not a single doom .
in the name lay a moiety of the world .
now , my dearest propn pray you , stand farther from me .
what ’ s the matter ?
i know by that same eye there ’ s some good news .
what , says the married woman you may go ?
would she had never given you leave to come !
let her not say ’ tis i that keep you here .
i have no power upon you .
hers you are .
the gods best know— oh never was there queen so mightily betrayed !
yet at the first i saw the treasons planted .
cleopatra— why should i think you can be mine , and true— though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods— who have been false to propn ?
riotous madness , to be entangled with those mouth - made vows which break themselves in swearing !
when you sued staying , then was the time for words .
no going then !
eternity was in our lips and eyes , propn in our brows ’ bent , none our parts so poor but was a race of propn .
they are so still , or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , art turned the greatest liar .
this is his sword .
i robbed his wound of it .
propn it stained with his most noble blood .
look you , sad friends , the gods rebuke me , but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings .
his taints and honors waged equal with him .
a rarer spirit never did steer humanity , but you gods will give us some faults to make us men .
propn is touched .
i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day , or look on thine .
hear me , good friends—
but i will tell you at some meeter season .
the business of this man looks out of him .
we ’ ll hear him what he says .
bid her have good heart .
she soon shall know of us , by some of ours , how honorable and how kindly we determine for her , for propn can not live to be ungentle .
so the gods preserve thee !
come hither , propn .
go and say we purpose her no shame .
go , and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her .
propn , i shall .
propn , go you along .
where propn propn , to second propn ?
propn !
let him alone , for i remember now how he ’ s employed .
he shall in time be ready .
go with me and see what i can show in this .
propn paltry to be propn .
not being propn , he ’ s but propn ’ s knave , a minister of her will .
propn sends greeting to the propn of propn , and bids thee study on what fair demands thou mean ’ st to have him grant thee .
what ’ s thy name ?
my name is propn .
propn did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but i do not greatly care to be deceived , that have no use for trusting .
if your master would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , that majesty , to keep decorum , must no less beg than a kingdom .
if he please to give me conquered propn for my son , he gives me so much of mine own as i will kneel to him with thanks .
be of good cheer .
you ’ re fall ’ n into a princely hand .
fear nothing .
let me report to him your sweet dependency , and you shall find a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness where he for grace is kneeled to .
pray you , tell him i am his fortune ’ s vassal , and i send him the greatness he has got .
i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience , and would gladly look him i ’ th ’ face .
this i ’ ll report , dear lady .
you see how easily she may be surprised .
propn propn !
o propn !
hold , worthy lady , hold !
do not yourself such wrong , who are in this relieved but not betrayed .
what , of death too , that rids our dogs of languish ?
propn , do not abuse my master ’ s bounty by propn undoing of yourself .
let the world see his nobleness well acted , which your death will never let come forth .
where art thou , death ?
come hither , come !
come , come and take a queen worth many babes and beggars !
oh , temperance , lady !
this mortal house i ’ ll ruin , do propn what he can .
know , sir , that i will not wait pinioned at your master ’ s court , nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull propn .
shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring propn ?
rather a ditch in propn be gentle grave unto me .
rather on propn mud propn me stark naked and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring .
rather make my country ’ s high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains !
you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in propn .
propn , what thou hast done thy master propn knows , and he hath sent for thee .
for the propn , i ’ ll take her to my guard .
so , propn , it shall content me best .
be gentle to her .
most noble propn , you have heard of me ?
i can not tell .
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams .
is propn not your trick ?
i understand not , madam .
i dreamt there was an emperor antony .
oh , such another sleep , that i might see but such another man !
his reared arm propn the world .
for his bounty , there was no winter in propn , an autumn ’ twas that grew the more by reaping .
in his livery walked crowns and crownets .
realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket .
cleopatra— think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of ?
gentle madam , no .
you lie up to the hearing of the gods .
nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy , yet t ’ imagine an propn were nature ’ s piece ’ gainst fancy , condemning shadows quite .
hear me , good madam .
your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it as answering to the weight .
would i might never o ’ ertake pursued success , but i do feel , by the rebound of yours , a grief that smites my very heart at root .
i thank you , sir .
know you what propn means to do with me ?
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew .
arise , you shall not kneel .
i pray you , rise .
propn , the gods will have it thus .
take to you no hard thoughts .
i ’ ll take my leave .
and may , through all the world !
propn yours , and we , your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall hang in what place you please .
here , my good lord .
how now , lady ?
i would i had thy inches .
thou shouldst know there were a heart in propn .
hear me , propn : the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile , but my full heart remains in use with you .
our propn shines o ’ er with civil swords .
propn propn makes his approaches to the port of propn .
my more particular , and that which most with you should safe my going , is propn ’ s death .
can propn die ?
she ’ s dead , my propn .
you shall advise me in all for propn .
this is the brief of money , plate , and jewels i am possessed of .
propn exactly valued , not petty things admitted .
where ’ s seleucus ?
here , madam .
this is my treasurer .
let him speak , my lord , upon his peril , that i have reserved to myself nothing .
propn , i had rather seal my lips than to my peril speak that which is not .
what have i kept back ?
enough to purchase what you have made known .
nay , blush not , propn .
see , propn !
oh , behold how pomp is followed !
the ingratitude of this propn does even make me wild .
thou shalt go back , i warrant thee !
but i ’ ll catch thine eyes , though they had wings .
oh , rarely base !
propn , not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i ’ th ’ roll of conquest .
still be ’ t yours .
bestow it at your pleasure , and believe propn propn no merchant , to make prize with you of things that merchants sold .
therefore be cheered .
no , dear propn , for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel .
feed and sleep .
our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend .
and so , adieu .
my master , and my lord !
not so .
propn .
but , hark thee , propn .
finish , good lady .
propn , i will .
where ’ s the propn ?
propn , sir .
propn !
make your best use of this .
i have performed your pleasure and my promise .
propn , i shall remain your debtor .
i your servant .
propn , good propn .
i must attend on propn .
propn , and thanks .
now , propn , what think ’ st thou ?
thou an egyptian puppet shalt be shown in propn , as well as i .
mechanic slaves with greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall uplift us to the view .
the gods forbid !
propn , ’ tis most certain , propn .
oh , the good gods !
nay , that ’ s certain .
i ’ ll never see propn !
for i am sure mine nails are stronger than mine eyes .
why , that ’ s the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents .
now , propn !
show me , my women , like a queen .
go fetch my best attires .
propn propn this noise ?
here is a rural fellow that will not be denied your propn presence .
he brings you figs .
let him come in .
what poor an instrument may do a noble deed !
he brings me liberty .
my resolution ’ s placed , and i have nothing of woman in me .
now from head to foot i am marble - constant .
now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine .
this is the man .
avoid , and leave him .
propn thou the pretty worm of propn there , that kills and pains not ?
truly , i have him , but i would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal .
those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
propn thou any that have died on propn ?
very many , men and women too .
truly , she makes a very good report o ’ propn worm .
but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do .
but this is most falliable , the worm ’ s an odd worm .
i wish you all joy of the worm .
propn .
you must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
ay , ay .
propn .
look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for indeed there is no goodness in the worm .
very good .
will it eat me ?
you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman .
well , get thee gone .
propn .
give me my robe .
put on my crown .
i have immortal longings in me .
propn , yare , good propn , quick .
methinks i hear propn call .
i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act .
i hear him mock the luck of propn , which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath .— propn , i come !
now to that name my courage prove my title !
i am fire and air , my other elements i give to baser life .— so , have you done ?
come then and take the last warmth of my lips .
propn , kind propn .
iras , long farewell .
have i the aspic in my lips ?
dost fall ?
if thou and nature can so gently part , the stroke of death is as a lover ’ s pinch , which hurts , and is desired .
dost thou lie still ?
if thus thou vanishest , thou tell ’ st the world it is not worth leave - taking .
dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that i may say the gods themselves do weep !
come , thou mortal wretch , with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie .
poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch .
oh , couldst thou speak , that i might hear thee call great propn ass unpolicied !
o eastern star !
peace , peace !
dost thou not see my baby at my breast , that sucks the nurse asleep ?
as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle— o antony ! —nay , i will take thee too .
what should i stay— in this wild world ?
so , fare thee well .
now boast thee , death , in thy possession lies a lass unparalleled .
propn windows , close ,
and golden phoebus never be beheld of eyes again so royal !
your crown ’ s awry .
i ’ ll mend it and then play— where propn the propn ?
speak softly .
wake her not .
propn hath sent— too slow a messenger .
oh , come apace , dispatch !
i partly feel thee .
there ’ s propn sent from propn .
call him .
what work is here , propn ?
is this well done ?
it is well done and fitting for a princess descended of so many royal kings .
ah , soldier !
how goes it here ?
all dead .
propn , thy thoughts touch their effects in this .
thyself art coming to see performed the dreaded act which thou so sought ’ st to hinder .
o most false love !
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water ?
now i see , i see , in propn ’ s death how mine received shall be .
by the fire that quickens propn slime , i go from hence propn soldier , servant , making peace or war as thou affects .
cut my lace , propn , come !
but let it be .
i am quickly ill , and well , so propn loves .
my precious propn , forbear , and give true evidence to his love which stands an honorable trial .
so propn told me .
i prithee , turn aside and weep for her .
then bid adieu to me , and say the tears belong to propn .
o sir , you are too sure an augurer .
that you did fear is done .
the manner of their deaths ?
i do not see them bleed .
who was last with them ?
a simple countryman that brought her figs .
this was his basket .
poisoned , then .
oh , propn , this propn lived but now .
she stood and spake .
i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress .
tremblingly she stood and on the sudden dropped .
oh , noble weakness !
here on her breast there is a vent of blood , and something blown .
the like is on her arm .
this is an aspic ’ s trail , and these fig leaves have slime upon them , such as th ’ aspic leaves upon the caves of propn .
take up her bed and bear her women from the monument .
she shall be buried by her propn .
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous .
our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral , and then to propn .
come , propn , see high order in this great solemnity .
you ’ ll heat my blood .
no more .
you can do better yet , but this is meetly .
now , by my sword— and target .
i ’ ll leave you , lady .
courteous lord , one word .
propn , you and i must part , but that ’ s not it .
propn sweating labor to bear such idleness so near the heart as propn this .
but , sir , forgive me , since my becomings kill me when they do not propn well to you .
your honor calls you hence .
therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , and all the gods go with you !
upon your sword propn laurel victory , and smooth success be strewed before your feet .
let us go .
come .
our separation so abides and flies that thou , residing here , goes yet with me , and i , hence fleeting , here remain with thee .
you are too indulgent .
say this becomes him— as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things can not blemish — yet must propn no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness .
if he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness , full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for propn .
here ’ s more news .
propn is strong at sea , and it appears he is beloved of those that only have feared propn .
i should have known no less .
it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were , and the ebbed man , propn loved till propn worth love , comes deared by being lacked .
propn , i bring thee word menecrates and propn , famous pirates , make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound with keels of every kind .
many hot inroads they make in propn — the borders maritime propn blood to think on propn — and flush youth revolt .
propn , leave thy lascivious wassails .
when thou once propn beaten from propn , where thou propn propn and propn , consuls , at thy heel did famine follow , whom thou fought ’ st against , though daintily brought up , with patience more than savages could suffer .
thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at .
propn pity of him .
let his shames quickly drive him to propn .
propn time we twain did show ourselves i ’ th ’ field , and to that end assemble we immediate council .
propn propn in our idleness .
tomorrow , propn , i shall be furnished to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time .
till which encounter it is my business too .
propn .
propn , my lord .
charmian !
propn ?
that i might sleep out this great gap of time my propn is away .
you think of him too much .
oh , ’ tis treason !
propn , i trust , not so .
what ’ s your highness ’ pleasure ?
not now to hear thee sing .
i take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has .
propn well for thee that , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of propn .
propn thou affections ?
yes , gracious madam .
indeed ?
not in deed , madam , for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done .
stands he or sits he ?
or does he walk ?
or is he on his horse ?
o happy horse , to bear the weight of propn !
he ’ s speaking now , or murmuring “ where ’ s my serpent of old propn ? ” for so he calls me .
now i feed myself with most delicious poison .
think on me , that am with phoebus ’ amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time .
nay , hear them , propn .
perform propn , or else we damn thee . ” how , my love ?
perchance ?
nay , and most like .
you must not stay here longer .
call in the messengers .
as i am propn ’ s queen , propn blushest , propn , and that blood of thine is propn ’ s homager .
the messengers !
sovereign of propn , hail !
how much unlike art thou propn propn !
yet , coming from him , that great med ’ cine hath with his tinct gilded thee .
how goes it with my brave propn propn ?
last thing he did , dear propn , he kissed — the last of many doubled kisses— this orient pearl .
mine ear must pluck it thence .
good friend , ” quoth he , “ say the firm propn to great propn sends this treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , to mend the petty present , i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms .
all the propn , propn thou , shall call her mistress . ” so he nodded , and soberly did mount an arm - gaunt steed , who neighed so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbed by him .
what was he , sad or merry ?
like to the time propn th ’ year between the extremes of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .
note him , note him , good propn , ’ tis the man , but note him .
he was not sad , for he would shine on those that make their looks by his .
he was not merry , which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay in propn with his joy , but between both .
o heavenly mingle !
propn thou sad or merry , the violence of either thee becomes , so does it no man else .— propn thou my posts ?
ay , madam , twenty several messengers .
why do you send so thick ?
who ’ s born that day when i forget to send to propn shall die a beggar .
ink and paper , propn .
welcome , my good propn .
did i , propn , ever love propn so ?
oh , that brave propn !
be choked with such another emphasis !
say , “ the brave propn . ” the valiant propn !
by propn , i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with propn paragon again my man of men .
by your most gracious pardon , i sing but after you .
my salad days , when i was green in judgment , cold in blood , to say as i said then .
we , ignorant of ourselves , propn often our own harms , which the wise powers deny us for our good , so find we profit by losing of our prayers .
i shall do well .
the people love me , and the sea is mine .
my powers are crescent , and my auguring hope says it will come to th ’ full .
propn propn in propn sits at dinner , and will make no wars without doors .
propn gets money where he loses hearts .
lepidus flatters both , of both is flattered , but he neither loves , nor either cares for him .
propn and propn are in the field .
a mighty strength they carry .
where have you this ?
propn false .
from propn , sir .
he dreams .
i know they are in propn together looking for propn .
but all the charms of love , propn propn , soften thy wanned lip !
let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both .
tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , keep his brain fuming .
this is most certain that i shall deliver : propn propn is every hour in propn propn .
since he went from propn propn a space for farther travel .
his soldiership is twice the other twain .
but let us rear the higher our opinion , that our stirring can from the lap of propn ’ s widow pluck the propn lust - wearied propn .
i can not hope propn and propn shall well greet together .
i know not , propn , how lesser enmities may give way to greater .
be propn as our gods will have propn .
it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands .
come , propn .
propn propn , ’ tis a worthy deed , and shall become you well , to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech .
i shall entreat him to answer like himself .
by propn , were i the wearer of propn ’ s beard , i would not shave propn today .
propn not a time for private stomaching .
but small to greater matters must give way .
not if the small come first .
here comes the noble propn .
and yonder , propn .
propn spoken well .
were we before our armies , and to fight , i should do thus .
welcome to propn .
thank you .
sit .
sit , sir .
nay , then .
i must be laughed at propn or for nothing or a little , i should say myself offended , and with you propn propn th ’ world ; more laughed at , that i should once name you derogately , when to sound your name it not concerned me .
my being in propn , propn , what was propn to you ?
no more than my residing here at propn might be to you in propn .
yet if you there did practice on my state , your being in propn might be my question .
how intend you , “ practiced ” ?
you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me .
your wife and brother made wars upon me , and their contestation was theme for you .
you were the word of war .
you do mistake your business .
my brother never did urge me in his act .
did he not rather propn my authority with yours , and make the wars alike against my stomach , having alike your cause ?
of this my letters before did satisfy you .
if you ’ ll patch a quarrel , as matter whole you have to make it with , it must not be with this .
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me , but you patched up your excuses .
not so , not so .
i know you could not lack , i am certain on propn , very necessity of this thought , that i , your partner in the cause ’ gainst which he fought , could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace .
as for my wife , i would you had her spirit in such another .
the third propn th ’ world is yours , which with a snaffle you may pace easy , but not such a wife .
for that you must but say i could not help it .
i wrote to you when rioting in propn .
three kings i had newly feasted , and did want of what i was propn th ’ morning .
but next day i told him of myself , which was as much as to have asked him pardon .
let this fellow be nothing of our strife .
hear the ambassadors .
no messenger but thine , and all alone tonight we ’ ll wander through the streets and note the qualities of people .
you have broken the article of your oath , which you shall never have tongue to charge me with .
soft , propn .
no , propn , let him speak .
the honor is sacred which he talks on now , supposing that i lacked it .— but , on , propn .
the article of my oath ?
to lend me arms and aid when i required them , the which you both denied .
neglected , rather , and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge .
propn noble spoken .
if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye , to forget them quite were to remember that the present need propn to atone you .
worthily spoken , propn .
or , if you borrow one another ’ s love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of propn , return it again .
you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
thou art a soldier only .
therefore speak no more .
go to , then .
give me leave , propn .
speak , propn .
thou hast a sister by the mother ’ s side , propn propn .
great propn propn is now a widower .
say not so , propn .
if propn heard you , your reproof were well deserved of rashness .
i am not married , propn .
let me hear propn further speak .
by this marriage , all little jealousies , which now seem great , and all great fears , which now import their dangers , would then be nothing .
her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her .
will propn speak ?
the power of propn , and his power unto propn .
may i never to this good purpose , that so fairly shows , dream of impediment !
there ’ s my hand .
a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly .
let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never fly off our loves again !
happily , amen !
i did not think to draw my sword ’ gainst propn , for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me .
time calls upon ’ s .
of us must propn presently be sought , or else he seeks out us .
where lies he ?
what is his strength by land ?
great and increasing .
but by sea he is an absolute master .
so is the fame .
let us , propn , not lack your company .
noble propn , not sickness should detain me .
propn propn !
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
you stayed well by propn in propn .
eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast — and but twelve persons there !
is this true ?
this was but as a fly by an eagle .
we had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
she ’ s a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
i will tell you .
the poop was beaten gold , propn the sails , and so perfumèd that the winds were lovesick with them .
the oars were silver , which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made the water which they beat to follow faster , as amorous of their strokes .
on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling propn , with divers - colored fans , whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , and what they undid did .
oh , rare for propn !
upon her landing , propn sent to her , invited her to supper .
she replied it should be better he became her guest , which she entreated .
royal wench !
now propn must leave her utterly .
age can not wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety .
other women cloy the appetites they feed , but she makes hungry where most she satisfies , for vilest things become themselves in her , that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish .
let us go .
propn propn , make yourself my guest whilst you abide here .
humbly , sir , i thank you .
all which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you .
good night .
if you can , your reason ?
but yet hie you to propn again .
say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , propn propn or mine ?
propn ’ s .
therefore , o propn , stay not by his side .
thy dæmon — that thy spirit which keeps thee — is noble , courageous , high , unmatchable where propn propn is not .
but near him thy angel becomes afeard , as being o ’ erpowered .
therefore make space enough between you .
rest you happy !
speak this no more .
to none but thee , no more but when to thee .
if thou dost play with him at any game , thou art sure to lose , and of that natural luck he beats thee ’ gainst the odds .
thy luster thickens when he shines by .
i will to propn .
and though i make this marriage for my peace , propn propn propn my pleasure lies .
o come , propn .
you must to propn .
your commission ’ s ready .
follow me and receive propn .
trouble yourselves no further .
pray you , hasten your generals after .
propn , propn propn will propn but kiss propn , and we ’ ll follow .
till i shall see you in your soldiers ’ dress , which will become you both , farewell .
your way is shorter .
my purposes do draw me much about .
you ’ ll win two days upon me .
propn , good success .
propn .
give me some music .
music , moody food of us that trade in love .
the music , ho !
let it alone .
let ’ s to billiards .
come , propn .
my arm is sore .
as well as i can , madam .
i ’ ll none now .
give me mine angle .
we ’ ll to propn river .
there , my music playing far off , i will betray propn - finned fishes .
propn thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , that long time have been barren .
propn , madam— propn ’ s dead !
if thou say so , villain , propn kill ’ st thy mistress .
but well and free , if thou so yield him , there is gold , and here my bluest veins to kiss — a hand that kings have lipped , and trembled kissing .
first , madam , he is well .
why , there ’ s more gold .
but , sirrah , mark , we use to say the dead are well .
bring it to that , the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill - uttering throat .
good madam , hear me .
well , go to , i will .
but there ’ s no goodness in thy face — if propn be free and healthful , so tart a favor to trumpet such good tidings !
if that you were the good propn propn ’ s son , as you have whispered faithfully you were , and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limned and living in your face , be truly welcome hither .
i am the duke that loved your father .
the residue of your fortune go to my cave and tell me .— good old man , thou art right welcome as thy master is .
support him by the arm .
give me your hand , and let me all your fortunes understand .
not see him since ?
propn , sir , that can not be .
but were i not the better part made mercy , i should not seek an absent argument of my revenge , thou present .
but look to it : find out thy brother , wheresoe'er he is .
bring him , dead or living , within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more to seek a living in our territory .
propn lands and all things that thou dost call thine worth seizure , do we seize into our hands till thou canst quit thee by thy brother ’ s mouth of what we think against thee .
oh , that your propn knew my heart in this : i never loved my brother in my life .
more villain thou .— well , push him out of doors and let my officers of such a nature make an extent upon his house and lands .
do this expediently , and turn him going .
hang there , my verse , in witness of my love .
and how like you this shepherd ’ s life , propn propn ?
truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life ; but in respect that it is a shepherd ’ s life , it is naught .
in respect that it is solitary , i like it very well ; but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .
now in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .
hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
such a one is a natural philosopher .
wast ever in court , shepherd ?
no , truly .
then thou art damned .
nay , i hope .
your reason .
why , if thou never wast at court , thou never saw ’ st good manners ; if thou never saw ’ st good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation .
thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
not a whit , propn .
those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court .
you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands .
that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .
instance , briefly .
come , instance .
why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
why , do not your courtier ’ s hands sweat ?
and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?
a better instance , i say .
come .
besides , our hands are hard .
your lips will feel them the sooner .
come .
most shallow man .
thou worms ' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .
learn of the wise and perpend : civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat .
mend the instance , shepherd .
you have too courtly a wit for me .
i ’ ll rest .
good morrow to your worship .
can you tell if propn , the duke ’ s daughter , be banished with her father ?
where will the old duke live ?
propn thou rest damned ?
propn help thee , shallow man .
propn make incision in thee ; thou art raw .
that is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she - lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked - pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
here comes young propn propn , my new mistress ’ s brother .
no jewel is like propn .
her worth being mounted on the wind , through all the world bears propn .
all the pictures fairest lined are but black to propn .
let no fair be kept in mind but the fair of propn .
i ’ ll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted .
it is the right butter - women ’ s rank to market .
out , fool .
for a taste : if a hart do lack a hind , let him seek out propn .
if the cat will after kind , so , be sure , will propn .
winter garments must be lined , so must slender propn .
they that reap must sheaf and bind , then to cart with propn .
propn nut hath sourest rind ; such a nut is propn .
he that sweetest rose will find must find love ’ s prick , and propn .
this is the very false gallop of verses .
why do you infect yourself with them ?
peace , you dull fool .
i found them on a tree .
truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
you have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .
peace .
but upon the fairest boughs , or at every sentence end , will i “ propn ” write , teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite propn would in little show .
therefore propn nature charged that one body should be filled with all graces wide - enlarged .
nature presently distilled propn ’ s cheek , but not her heart , propn ’ s majesty , propn ’ s better part , propn propn ’ s modesty .
thus propn of many parts by heavenly synod was devised , of many faces , eyes , and hearts to have the touches dearest prized .
propn would that she these gifts should have and i to live and die her slave .
propn thou hear these verses ?
oh , yes , i heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse , and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?
is it a man ?
and a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
change you color ?
i prithee , who ?
o propn , propn , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
nay , but who is it ?
is it possible ?
nay , i prithee now , with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .
o wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful , and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all whooping !
good my complexion , dost thou think though i am caparisoned like a man , i have a doublet and hose in my disposition ?
one inch of delay more is a propn propn of discovery .
i prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
i would thou couldst stammer , that thou might ’ st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow - mouthed bottle — either too much at once , or none at all .
i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that i may drink thy tidings .
so you may put a man in your belly .
is he of propn ’ s making ?
what manner of man ?
is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard ?
nay , he hath but a little beard .
why , propn will send more , if the man will be thankful .
let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
it is young propn , that tripped up the wrestler ’ s heels and your heart both in an instant .
nay , but the devil take mocking .
i ' faith , coz , ’ tis he .
propn ?
propn .
what did he when thou propn him ?
what said he ?
how looked he ?
wherein went he ?
what makes him here ?
did he ask for me ?
where remains he ?
how parted he with thee ?
and when shalt thou see him again ?
answer me in one word .
but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man ’ s apparel ?
looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
but take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn .
it may well be called propn propn tree when it drops forth such fruit .
give me audience , good madam .
proceed .
there lay he , stretched along like a wounded knight .
though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
cry “ holla ” to thy tongue , i prithee .
it curvets unseasonably .
he was furnished like a hunter .
oh , ominous !
he comes to kill my heart .
i would sing my song without a burden .
thou bring ’ st me out of tune .
do you not know i am a woman ?
when i think , i must speak .
sweet , say on .
you bring me out .
soft , comes he not here ?
propn he .
i thank you for your company , but , good faith , i had as lief have been myself alone .
and so had i , but yet , for fashion sake , i thank you too for your society .
propn be wi ' you .
let ’ s meet as little as we can .
i do desire we may be better strangers .
i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks .
i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .
propn is your love ’ s name ?
yes , just .
i do not like her name .
what stature is she of ?
just as high as my heart .
you are full of pretty answers .
the worst fault you have is to be in love .
propn a fault i will not change for your best virtue .
i am weary of you .
there i shall see mine own figure .
which i take to be either a fool or a cipher .
i ’ ll tarry no longer with you .
propn , good propn propn .
i am glad of your departure .
propn , good propn propn .
very well .
what would you ?
you should ask me what time o ' day .
there ’ s no clock in the forest .
then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
marry , do i , sir , and i came to acquaint you with a matter .
i am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother propn hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .
tomorrow , sir , i wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .
your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love i would be loath to foil him , as i must for my own honor if he come in .
therefore , out of my love to you , i came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
propn , i thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite .
i had myself notice of my brother ’ s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it ; but he is resolute .
i ’ ll tell thee , propn : it is the stubbornest young fellow of propn , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man ’ s good parts , a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother .
therefore use thy discretion .
i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .
i speak but brotherly of him , but should i anatomize him to thee as he is , i must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .
and why not the swift foot of time ?
had not that been as proper ?
by no means , sir .
time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons .
i ’ ll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .
i prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
who ambles time withal ?
these time ambles withal .
who doth he gallop withal ?
who stays it still withal ?
with lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how time moves .
where dwell you , pretty youth ?
are you native of this place ?
as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
i have been told so of many .
but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love .
i have heard him read many lectures against it , and i thank propn i am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .
can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
there were none principal .
i prithee , recount some of them .
no , i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .
there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “ propn ” on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of propn .
i am he that is so love - shaked .
i pray you tell me your remedy .
there is none of my uncle ’ s marks upon you .
he taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner .
what were his marks ?
a lean cheek , which you have not ; a blue eye and sunken , which you have not ; an unquestionable spirit , which you have not ; a beard neglected , which you have not — but i pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother ’ s revenue .
then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied , and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation .
but you are no such man .
you are rather point - device in your accouterments , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
fair youth , i would i could make thee believe i love .
me believe it ?
but , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein propn is so admired ?
i swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of propn , i am that he , that unfortunate he .
but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
love is merely a madness and , i tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too .
yet i profess curing it by counsel .
did you ever cure any so ?
yes , one , and in this manner .
i would not be cured , youth .
i would cure you if you would but call me propn and come every day to my cote and woo me .
now , by the faith of my love , i will .
tell me where it is .
go with me to it , and i ’ ll show it you ; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live .
will you go ?
with all my heart , good youth .
nay , you must call me propn .— come , sister , will you go ?
come apace , good propn .
i will fetch up your goats , propn .
doth my simple feature content you ?
your features , propn warrant us !
what features ?
truly , i would the gods had made thee poetical .
i do not know what “ poetical ” is .
is it honest in deed and word ?
is it a true thing ?
no , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .
do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
i do , truly , for thou swear ’ st to me thou art honest .
now , if thou wert a poet , i might have some hope thou didst feign .
would you not have me honest ?
no , truly , unless thou wert hard - favored , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .
well , i am not fair , and therefore i pray the gods make me honest .
i am not a slut , though i thank the gods i am foul .
well , praised be the gods for thy foulness ; sluttishness may come hereafter .
but what though ?
courage .
well , that is the dowry of his wife ; ’ tis none of his own getting .
horns ?
even so .
poor men alone ?
no , no .
the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
is the single man therefore blessed ?
no .
as a walled town is more worthier than a village , so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor .
here comes propn propn .— propn propn propn , you are well met .
will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
is there none here to give the woman ?
i will not take her on gift of any man .
truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
how do you , sir ?
you are very well met .
propn ' ild you for your last company .
i am very glad to see you .
even a toy in hand here , sir .
nay , pray be covered .
will you be married , motley ?
as the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb , and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires ; and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
and will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is .
then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
come , sweet propn .
we must be married , or we must live in bawdry .— propn , good propn propn , not ' propn no matter .
ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
never talk to me .
i will weep .
do , i prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .
but have i not cause to weep ?
as good cause as one would desire .
therefore weep .
and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
i am heartily glad i came hither to you .
if he come tomorrow , i ’ ll give him his payment .
if ever he go alone again , i ’ ll never wrestle for prize more .
propn , good propn .
but it shall not be so long ; this wrestler shall clear all .
you have heard him swear downright he was .
he attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him .
so he laughed and let me go .
but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as propn ?
oh , that ’ s a brave man .
who comes here ?
mistress and master , you have oft inquired after the shepherd that complained of love , who you saw sitting by me on the turf , praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress .
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
propn propn , do not scorn me .
do not , propn .
say that you love me not , but say not so in bitterness .
now counterfeit to swoon , why , now fall down ; or if thou canst not , oh , for shame , for shame , lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers .
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee .
but now mine eyes , which i have darted at thee , hurt thee not .
nor , i am sure , there is no force in eyes that can do hurt .
o dear propn , if ever — as that ever may be near— you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , then shall you know the wounds invisible that love ’ s keen arrows make .
but till that time come not thou near me .
and when that time comes , afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , as till that time i shall not pity thee .
but , mistress , know yourself .
down on your knees and thank propn , fasting , for a good man ’ s love , for i must tell you friendly in your ear , sell when you can ; you are not for all markets .
cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer .
so take her to thee , shepherd .
besides , i like you not .
will you go , sister ? — propn , ply her hard .
come , sister .— propn , look on him better , and be not proud .
though all the world could see , none could be so abused in sight as he .
propn propn , pity me .
why , i am sorry for thee , gentle propn .
if you do sorrow at my grief in love , by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermined .
thou hast my love .
is not that neighborly ?
i would have you .
why , that were covetousness .
but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employed .
propn thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
not very well , but i have met him oft , and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of .
think not i love him , though i ask for him .
propn but a peevish boy — yet he talks well— but what care i for words ?
yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear .
it is a pretty youth — not very pretty— but sure he ’ s proud — and yet his pride becomes him .
he ’ ll make a proper man .
he is not very tall — yet for his years he ’ s tall .
his leg is but so - so — and yet ’ tis well .
there was a pretty redness in his lip , a little riper and more lusty red than that mixed in his cheek : ’ twas just the difference propn the constant red and mingled damask .
for what had he to do to chide at me ?
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and , now i am remembered , scorned at me .
i marvel why i answered not again .
but that ’ s all one : omittance is no quittance .
i ’ ll write to him a very taunting letter , and thou shalt bear it .
wilt thou , propn ?
propn , with all my heart .
i will be bitter with him and passing short .
go with me , propn .
i prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
they say you are a melancholy fellow .
i am so .
i do love it better than laughing .
those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .
why , ’ tis good to be sad and say nothing .
why then , ’ tis good to be a post .
i have neither the scholar ’ s melancholy , which is emulation ; nor the musician propn , which is fantastical ; nor the courtier propn , which is proud ; nor the soldier propn , which is ambitious ; nor the lawyer propn , which is politic ; nor the lady propn , which is nice ; nor the lover propn , which is all these , but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness .
a traveler .
by my faith , you have great reason to be sad .
i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men ’ s .
then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
yes , i have gained my experience .
and your experience makes you sad .
i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad— and to travel for it , too .
good day and happiness , dear propn .
my fair propn , i come within an hour of my promise .
i pray thee , propn , sweet my coz , be merry .
propn propn , i show more mirth than i am mistress of , and would you yet i were merrier ?
unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
propn i see thou propn me not with the full weight that i love thee .
well , i will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .
by mine honor i will , and when i break that oath , let me turn monster .
therefore , my sweet propn , my dear propn , be merry .
from henceforth i will , coz , and devise sports .
let me see — what think you of falling in love ?
break an hour ’ s promise in love ?
pardon me , dear propn .
nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight .
i had as lief be wooed of a snail .
of a snail ?
besides , he brings his destiny with him .
what ’ s that ?
why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for .
but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
virtue is no hornmaker , and my propn is virtuous .
and i am your propn .
propn of a better leer than you .
come , woo me , woo me , for now i am in a holiday humor , and like enough to consent .
what would you say to me now , an i were your very , very propn ?
i would kiss before i spoke .
nay , you were better speak first , and when you were graveled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss .
very good orators , when they are out , they will spit ; and for lovers lacking — propn warn us — matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
how if the kiss be denied ?
who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
marry , that should you if i were your mistress , or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
am not i your rosalind ?
i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her .
no , faith , die by attorney .
the poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicet , in a love cause .
then love me , propn .
yes , faith , will i , propn and propn and all .
and wilt thou have me ?
ay , and twenty such .
what sayest thou ?
are you not good ?
i hope so .
why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ? — come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us .— give me your hand , propn .— what do you say , sister ?
pray thee , marry us .
i will .
ay , but when ?
why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
then you must say “ i take thee , propn , for wife . ” i take thee , propn , for wife .
i might ask you for your commission , but i do take thee , propn , for my husband .
so do all thoughts .
they are winged .
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
forever and a day .
say “ a day ” without the “ ever . ” no , no , propn , men are propn when they woo , propn when they we d . maids are propn when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock- pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more newfangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey .
i will weep for nothing , like propn in the fountain , and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry .
i will laugh like a hyena , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
but will my propn do so ?
oh , but she is wise .
or else she could not have the wit to do this .
the wiser , the waywarder .
make the doors upon a woman ’ s wit , and it will out at the casement .
shut that , and ’ twill out at the keyhole .
stop that , ’ twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
a man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say “ propn , whither wilt ? ” propn , you might keep that check for it , till you met your wife ’ s wit going to your neighbor ’ s bed .
you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue .
oh , that woman that can not make her fault her husband ’ s occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .
for these two hours , propn , i will leave thee .
i must attend the duke at dinner .
by two o'clock i will be with thee again .
ay , go your ways , go your ways .
i knew what you would prove .
my friends told me as much , and i thought no less .
propn but one cast away , and so , come , death .
two o'clock is your hour ?
ay , sweet propn .
therefore beware my censure , and keep your promise .
with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my propn .
so , adieu .
well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .
propn .
you have simply misused our sex in your love - prate .
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .
o coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love .
or rather bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
no , that same wicked bastard of propn that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen , and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone ’ s eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep i am in love .
i ’ ll tell thee , propn , i can not be out of the sight of propn .
i ’ ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
and i ’ ll sleep .
which is he that killed the deer ?
yes , sir .
sing it .
propn no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
how say you now ?
is it not past two o'clock ?
and here much propn .
look who comes here .
no , i protest , i know not the contents .
propn did write it .
what shall be our sport , then ?
let us sit and mock the good housewife propn from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
no ?
when propn hath made a fair creature , may she not by propn fall into the fire ?
though propn hath given us wit to flout at propn , hath not propn sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
come , come , you are a fool , and turned into the extremity of love .
i say she never did invent this letter .
this is a man ’ s invention , and his hand .
sure it is hers .
why , she defies me like propn to propn .
propn ’ s gentle brain could not drop forth such giant - rude invention , such propn words , blacker in their effect than in their countenance .
will you hear the letter ?
so please you , for i never heard it yet , yet heard too much of propn ’ s cruelty .
she phoebes me .
propn how the tyrant writes .
that a maiden ’ s heart hath burned ?
call you this railing ?
why , thy godhead laid apart , propn thou with a woman ’ s heart ?
not to be endured .
it is no boast , being asked , to say we are .
propn doth commend him to you both , and to that youth he calls his propn he sends this bloody napkin .
are you he ?
some of my shame , if you will know of me what man i am , and how , and why , and where this handkercher was stained .
i pray you , tell it .
he threw his eye aside— and mark what object did present itself : under an old oak , whose boughs were mossed with age and high top bald with dry antiquity , a wretched , ragged man , o'ergrown with hair , propn sleeping on his back .
this seen , propn did approach the man and found it was his brother , his elder brother .
oh , i have heard him speak of that same brother , and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men .
but to propn : did he leave him there , food to the sucked and hungry lioness ?
twice did he turn his back and purposed so , but kindness , nobler ever than revenge , and nature , stronger than his just occasion , made him give battle to the lioness , who quickly fell before him ; in which hurtling , from miserable slumber i awaked .
are you his brother ?
was propn you he rescued ?
was propn you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
propn i , but ’ tis not i. i do not shame to tell you what i was , since my conversion so sweetly tastes , being the thing i am .
but for the bloody napkin ?
by and by .
propn , i recovered him , bound up his wound , and after some small space , being strong at heart ,
many will swoon when they do look on blood .
there is more in it .— propn propn .
look , he recovers .
i would i were at home .
we ’ ll lead you thither .
i pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
be of good cheer , youth .
you a man ?
you lack a man ’ s heart .
i do so , i confess it .
ah , sirrah , a body would think this was well - counterfeited .
i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited .
heigh - ho .
this was not counterfeit .
there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
propn , i assure you .
well then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .
so i do .
but i ' faith , i should have been a woman by right .
come , you look paler and paler .
that will i , for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother , propn .
i shall devise something .
but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him .
will you go ?
we shall find a time , propn .
patience , gentle propn .
faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman ’ s saying .
a most wicked propn propn , propn , a most vile propn .
but , propn , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .
here comes the man you mean .
it is meat and drink to me to see a clown .
how old are you , friend ?
five - and - twenty , sir .
a ripe age .
is thy name propn ?
propn , sir .
a fair name .
propn born i ' th ' forest here ?
ay , sir , i thank propn .
thank propn . ” a good answer .
art rich ?
faith , sir , so - so .
so - so ” is good , very good , very excellent good .
and yet it is not : it is but so - so .
art thou wise ?
ay , sir , i have a pretty wit .
why , thou sayst well .
give me your hand .
art thou learned ?
no , sir .
then learn this of me : to have is to have .
for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink , being poured out of a cup into a glass , by filling the one doth empty the other .
he , sir , that must marry this woman .
therefore , you clown , abandon — which is , in the vulgar , “ leave ” —the society — which in the boorish is “ company ” —of this female — which in the common is “ woman ” ; which together is , abandon the society of this female , or , clown , thou perishest ; or , to thy better understanding , diest ; or , to wit , i kill thee , make thee away , translate thy life into death , thy liberty into bondage .
i will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel .
i will bandy with thee in faction .
i will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways .
therefore tremble and depart .
do , good propn .
propn rest you merry , sir .
our master and mistress seeks you .
come away , away .
trip , propn , trip , propn .— i attend , i attend .
propn , you must come away to your father .
were you made the messenger ?
of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes , and swore by his honor the mustard was naught .
now , i ’ ll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ?
ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
stand you both forth now : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
by our beards ( if we had them ) , thou art .
by my knavery ( if i had it ) , then i were .
is ’ t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ?
it shall be to your good , for my father ’ s house and all the revenue that was old propn propn propn will i estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .
you have my consent .
let your wedding be tomorrow .
thither will i invite the duke and all ’ s contented followers .
go you and prepare propn , for look you , here comes my propn .
and you , fair sister .
o my dear propn , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf .
it is my arm .
i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
they are in the very wrath of love , and they will together .
clubs can not part them .
they shall be married tomorrow , and i will bid the duke to the nuptial .
but oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man ’ s eyes .
by so much the more shall i tomorrow be at the height of heart - heaviness , by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
why , then , tomorrow i can not serve your turn for propn ?
i can live no longer by thinking .
i will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch i say i know you are .
believe then , if you please , that i can do strange things .
i have , since i was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable .
if you do love propn so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries propn shall you marry her .
i know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow , human as she is , and without any danger .
propn thou in sober meanings ?
by my life i do , which i tender dearly , though i say i am a magician .
look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
i care not if i have .
you are there followed by a faithful shepherd .
good shepherd , tell this youth what ’ tis to love .
it is to be all made of sighs and tears , and so am i for propn .
and i for propn .
and i for propn .
and i for no woman .
it is to be all made of faith and service , and so am i for propn .
and i for propn .
and i for propn .
and i for no woman .
it is to be all made of fantasy , all made of passion and all made of wishes , all adoration , duty , and observance , all humbleness , all patience and impatience , all purity , all trial , all observance , and so am i for propn .
and so am i for propn .
and so am i for no woman .
if this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
if this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
if this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
why do you speak , too , “ why blame you me to love you ? ” ?
to her that is not here , nor doth not hear .
pray you , no more of this .
propn like the howling of irish wolves against the moon .
i ’ ll not fail , if i live .
nor i .
nor i .
tomorrow is the joyful day , propn .
tomorrow will we be married .
i do desire it with all my heart , and i hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world .
here comes two of the banished duke ’ s pages .
well met , honest gentleman .
by my troth , well met .
come , sit , sit , and a song .
we are for you .
sit i ' th ' middle .
shall we clap into propn roundly , without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse , which are the only prologues to a bad voice ?
i ' faith , i ' faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .
truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untunable .
dost thou believe , propn , that the boy can do all this that he hath promisèd ?
that would i , had i kingdoms to give with her .
that would i , were i of all kingdoms king .
that will i , should i die the hour after .
but if you do refuse to marry me , you ’ ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
so is the bargain .
though to have her and death were both one thing .
i have promised to make all this matter even .
keep your word , propn , that you ’ ll marry me or else , refusing me , to we d this shepherd .
keep your word , propn , that you ’ ll marry her if she refuse me .
and from hence i go to make these doubts all even .
i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter ’ s favor .
my lord , the first time that i ever saw him propn he was a brother to your daughter .
but , my good lord , this boy is forest - born and hath been tutored in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle , whom he reports to be a great magician propn in the circle of this forest .
good my lord , bid him welcome .
this is the motley - minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest .
he hath been a courtier , he swears .
if any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .
i have undone three tailors .
i have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
and how was that ta'en up ?
faith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
how “ seventh cause ” ? —good my lord , like this fellow .
i like him very well .
prithee , who is propn that thou mean ’ st ?
one that old propn , your father , loves .
my father ’ s love is enough to honor him .
enough .
speak no more of him ; you ’ ll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
with his mouth full of news .
which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .
then shall we be news - crammed .
all the better .
we shall be the more marketable .— propn , propn propn propn .
what ’ s the news ?
fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
sport ?
of what color ?
propn ' ild you , sir .
a poor virgin , sir , an ill - favored thing , sir , but mine own .
by my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
but for the seventh cause .
how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
upon a lie seven times removed .— bear your body more seeming , propn .— as thus , sir : i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier ’ s beard .
he sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was .
this is called “ the countercheck quarrelsome , ” and so to “ the lie circumstantial ” and “ the lie direct . ” and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?
he ’ s as good at anything and yet a fool .
he uses his folly like a stalking - horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
then is there mirth in propn when earthly things , made even , atone together .
good duke , receive thy daughter .
hymen from propn brought her , propn , brought her hither , that thou mightst join her hand with his whose heart within his bosom is .
if there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
if there be truth in sight , you are my propn .
if sight and shape be true , why then , my love adieu .
peace , ho !
o my dear niece , welcome thou art to me , even daughter , welcome in no less degree .
let me have audience for a word or two .
i am the second son of old propn propn , that bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
propn propn , hearing how that every day propn of great worth resorted to this forest , addressed a mighty power , which were on foot in his own conduct , purposely to take his brother here and put him to the sword .
this to be true i do engage my life .
propn , by your patience : if i heard you rightly , the duke hath put on a religious life and thrown into neglect the pompous court .
he hath .
to him will i .
out of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learned .
stay , jaques , stay .
to see no pastime i .
what you would have i ’ ll stay to know at your abandoned cave .
propn , proceed .
we ’ ll so begin these rites as we do trust they ’ ll end , in true delights .
if it be true that good wine needs no bush , ’ tis true that a good play needs no epilogue .
what color , madam ?
how shall i answer you ?
as wit and fortune will .
you tell us the manner of the wrestling .
well , the beginning that is dead and buried .
there comes an old man and his three sons— i could match this beginning with an old tale .
three proper young men of excellent growth and presence .
with bills on their necks : “ be it known unto all men by these presents . ” the eldest of the three wrestled with propn , the duke ’ s wrestler , which propn in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him .
so he served the second , and so the third .
yonder they lie , the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
alas !
but what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?
why , this that i speak of .
or i , i promise thee .
but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
shall we see this wrestling , cousin ?
yonder sure they are coming .
let us now stay and see it .
come on .
since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
is yonder the man ?
even he , madam .
alas , he is too young .
yet he looks successfully .
how now , daughter and cousin ?
are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
you will take little delight in it , i can tell you , there is such odds in the man .
in pity of the challenger ’ s youth , i would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .
call him hither , good propn propn propn .
yonder comes my master , your brother .
go apart , propn , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
propn the challenger , the propn calls for you .
i attend them with all respect and duty .
young man , have you challenged propn the wrestler ?
no , fair princess .
he is the general challenger .
i come but in as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .
you have seen cruel proof of this man ’ s strength .
if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise .
we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
do , young sir .
but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial , wherein , if i be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious ; if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so .
i shall do my friends no wrong , for i have none to lament me ; the world no injury , for in it i have nothing .
only in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty .
the little strength that i have , i would it were with you .
and mine , to eke out hers .
fare you well .
pray propn i be deceived in you .
your heart ’ s desires be with you .
you shall try but one fall .
no , i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
i would i were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
o excellent young man !
if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye , i can tell who should down .
no more , no more .
how dost thou , propn ?
he can not speak , my lord .
bear him away .
what is thy name , young man ?
propn , my liege , the youngest son of propn propn de propn .
i would thou hadst been son to some man else .
the world esteemed thy father honorable , but i did find him still mine enemy .
i would thou hadst told me of another father .
were i my father , coz , would i do this ?
i am more proud to be propn propn ’ s son , his youngest son , and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to propn .
my father loved propn propn as his soul , and all the world was of my father ’ s mind .
had i before known this young man his son , i should have given him tears unto entreaties propn he should thus have ventured .
gentle cousin , let us go thank him and encourage him .
shall we go , coz ?
ay .— fare you well , fair gentleman .
he calls us back .
will you go , coz ?
have with you .
fare you well .
what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?
i can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .
or propn or something weaker masters thee .
good sir , i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place .
albeit you have deserved high commendation , true applause , and love , yet such is now the duke ’ s condition that he misconsters all that you have done .
the duke is humorous .
but i can tell you that of late this duke propn ta'en displeasure ' gainst his gentle niece , grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father ’ s sake ; and , on my life , his malice ' gainst the lady will suddenly break forth .
propn , fare you well .
propn , in a better world than this , i shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
i rest much bounden to you .
fare you well .
thus must i from the smoke into the smother , from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .
but heavenly propn !
why , propn !
not one to throw at a dog .
no , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs .
throw some of them at me .
then there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .
but is all this for your father ?
no , some of it is for my child ’ s father .
if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
hem them away .
i would try , if i could cry “ hem ” and have him .
come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
oh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .
oh , a good wish upon you .
the duke my father loved his father dearly .
doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ?
by this kind of chase i should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly .
yet i hate not propn .
no , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
why should i not ?
doth he not deserve well ?
let me love him for that , and do you love him because i do .
look , here comes the duke .
with his eyes full of anger .
mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , and get you from our court .
me , uncle ?
you , cousin .
within these ten days if that thou beest found so near our public court as twenty miles , thou diest for it .
i do beseech your grace , let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me .
if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires , if that i do not dream or be not frantic— as i do trust i am not — then , dear uncle , never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness .
thus do all traitors .
if their purgation did consist in words , they are as innocent as grace itself .
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not .
thou art thy father ’ s daughter .
there ’ s enough .
so was i when your propn took his dukedom .
so was i when your propn banished him .
my father was no traitor .
then , good my liege , mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous .
dear sovereign , hear me speak .
ay , propn , we stayed her for your sake .
i was too young that time to value her , but now i know her .
if she be a traitor , why so am i .
thou art a fool .
she robs thee of thy name , and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone .
then open not thy lips .
firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have passed upon her .
she is banished .
pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege .
i can not live out of her company .
you are a fool .— you , niece , provide yourself .
if you outstay the time , upon mine honor and in the greatness of my word , you die .
o my poor propn , whither wilt thou go ?
wilt thou change fathers ?
i will give thee mine .
i charge thee , be not thou more grieved than i am .
i have more cause .
now , sir , what make you here ?
nothing .
i am not taught to make anything .
what mar you then , sir ?
marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
know you where you are , sir ?
o sir , very well : here in your orchard .
know you before whom , sir ?
ay , better than him i am before knows me .
i know you are my eldest brother , and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me .
i have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , i confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
thou hast not , cousin .
prithee , be cheerful .
propn thou not the duke propn banished me , his daughter ?
that he hath not .
no , hath not ?
rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one .
shall we be sundered ?
shall we part , sweet girl ?
for , by this propn , now at our sorrows pale , say what thou canst , i ’ ll go along with thee .
why , whither shall we go ?
to seek my uncle in the propn of propn .
alas , what danger will it be to us , propn as we are , to travel forth so far ?
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
i ’ ll put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face .
were it not better , because that i am more than common tall , that i did suit me all points like a man ?
a gallant curtal - axe upon my thigh , a boar - spear in my hand , and in my heart lie there what hidden woman ’ s fear there will , we ’ ll have a swashing and a martial outside— as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances .
what shall i call thee when thou art a man ?
i ’ ll have no worse a name than propn ’ s own page , and therefore look you call me propn .
but what will you be called ?
would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
leave me alone to woo him .
let ’ s away and get our jewels and our wealth together , devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight .
now go we in content to liberty , and not to banishment .
now , my co - mates and brothers in exile , propn not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp ?
are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court ?
these are counselors that feelingly persuade me what i am . ” sweet are the uses of adversity , which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , propn yet a precious jewel in his head .
and this our life , exempt from public haunt , finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , sermons in stones , and good in everything .
i would not change it .
happy is your grace , that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style .
come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
and indeed , my lord , the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting , and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase .
and did you leave him in this contemplation ?
we did , my lord , weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer .
show me the place .
i love to cope him in these sullen fits , for then he ’ s full of matter .
i ’ ll bring you to him straight .
can it be possible that no man saw them ?
it can not be .
some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this .
i can not hear of any that did see her .
the ladies , her attendants of her chamber saw her abed , and in the morning early they found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
my lord , the roinish clown , at whom so oft your grace was wo nt to laugh , is also missing .
send to his brother .
fetch that gallant hither .
if he be absent , bring his brother to me .
i ’ ll make him find him .
do this suddenly , and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways .
who ’ s there ?
why , what make you here ?
why are you virtuous ?
why do people love you ?
and wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant ?
why would you be so fond to overcome the bonny prizer of the humorous duke ?
your praise is come too swiftly home before you .
know you not , master , to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies ?
oh , what a world is this when what is comely propn him that bears it !
why , what ’ s the matter ?
within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives .
your brother — no , no brother — yet the son— yet not the son , i will not call him son— of him i was about to call his father propn heard your praises , and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie , and you within it .
if he fail of that , he will have other means to cut you off .
i overheard him and his practices .
this is no place , this house is but a butchery .
abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
why , whither , propn , wouldst thou have me go ?
no matter whither , so you come not here .
what , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food , or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road ?
yet this i will not do , do how i can .
i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
but do not so .
let me be your servant .
though i look old , yet i am strong and lusty , for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility .
therefore my age is as a lusty winter , propn but kindly .
let me go with you .
i ’ ll do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities .
o good old man , how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world , when service sweat for duty , not for meed .
but come thy ways .
we ’ ll go along together , and ere we have thy youthful wages spent , we ’ ll light upon some settled low content .
propn , go on , and i will follow thee to the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here livèd i , but now live here no more .
at seventeen years , many their fortunes seek , but at fourscore , it is too late a week .
yet fortune can not recompense me better than to die well , and not my master ’ s debtor .
o propn , how weary are my spirits !
i care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
i can not go no further .
for my part , i had rather bear with you than bear you .
ay , now am i in propn , the more fool i .
ay , be so , good propn .
look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
wilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?
i am no villain .
propn thou not my brother , i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so .
thou hast railed on thyself .
sweet masters , be patient .
for your father ’ s remembrance , be at accord .
let me go , i say .
i will not till i please .
you shall hear me .
my father charged you in his will to give me good education .
you have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .
the spirit of my father grows strong in me , and i will no longer endure it .
and what wilt thou do — beg when that is spent ?
well , sir , get you in .
i will not long be troubled with you .
you shall have some part of your will .
i pray you leave me .
that is the way to make her scorn you still .
o propn , that thou knew ’ st how i do love her !
i partly guess , for i have loved ere now .
no , propn , being old , thou canst not guess , though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sighed upon a midnight pillow .
but if thy love were ever like to mine— as sure i think did never man love so— how many actions most ridiculous propn thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?
into a thousand that i have forgotten .
oh , thou didst then ne'er love so heartily .
if thou rememb ’ rest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into , propn hast not loved .
or if thou hast not sat as i do now , wearying thy hearer in thy mistress ’ s praise , propn hast not loved .
or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly , as my passion now makes me , propn hast not loved .
o propn , propn , propn !
alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , i have by hard adventure found mine own .
and i mine .
i remember when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to propn propn .
and i remember the kissing of her batler , and the cow ’ s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked .
and i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom i took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears , “ wear these for my sake . ” we that are true lovers run into strange capers .
but as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
thou speak ’ st wiser than thou art ware of .
nay , i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it .
jove , propn , this shepherd ’ s passion is much upon my fashion .
and mine , but it grows something stale with me .
i pray you , one of you question yond man , if he for gold will give us any food .
peace , fool .
he ’ s not thy kinsman .
who calls ?
your betters , sir .
i prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment , bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed .
fair sir , i pity her and wish , for her sake more than for mine own , my fortunes were more able to relieve her .
but i am shepherd to another man and do not shear the fleeces that i graze .
besides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , by reason of his absence , there is nothing that you will feed on .
what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?
that young swain that you saw here but erewhile , that little cares for buying anything .
i pray thee , if it stand with honesty , propn thou the cottage , pasture , and the flock , and thou shalt have to pay for it of us .
and we will mend thy wages .
assuredly the thing is to be sold .
go with me .
if you like upon report the soil , the profit , and this kind of life , i will your very faithful feeder be and buy it with your gold right suddenly .
more , more , i prithee , more .
it will make you melancholy , propn propn .
i thank it .
more , i prithee , more .
i can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs .
more , i prithee , more .
my voice is ragged .
i know i can not please you .
come , more , another stanzo .
nay , i care not for their names .
well then , if ever i thank any man , i ’ ll thank you .
but that they call “ compliment ” is like th ' encounter of two dog- apes .
well , i ’ ll end the song .— propn , cover the while ; the duke will drink under this tree .— he hath been all this day to look you .
and i have been all this day to avoid him .
he is too disputable for my company .
i think of as many matters as he , but i give propn thanks and make no boast of them .
come , warble , come .
i ’ ll give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention .
dear master , i can go no further .
oh , i die for food .
here lie i down and measure out my grave .
propn , kind master .
why , how now , propn ?
no greater heart in thee ?
live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .
if this uncouth forest yield anything savage , i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
propn conceit is nearer death than thy powers .
i will here be with thee presently , and if i bring thee not something to eat , i will give thee leave to die .
but if thou diest before i come , thou art a mocker of my labor .
well said .
thou look ’ st cheerly , and i ’ ll be with thee quickly .
yet thou liest in the bleak air .
cheerly , good propn .
i think he be transformed into a beast , for i can nowhere find him like a man .
my lord , he is but even now gone hence .
here was he merry , hearing of a song .
if he , compact of jars , grow musical , we shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
go seek him .
tell him i would speak with him .
he saves my labor by his own approach .
why , how now , monsieur ?
what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company ?
what , you look merrily .
and then he drew a dial from his poke and , looking on it with lackluster eye , says very wisely , “ it is ten o'clock .
thus we may see , ” quoth he , “ how the world wags .
propn but an hour ago since it was nine , and after one hour more ’ twill be eleven .
o noble fool !
a worthy fool !
propn propn the only wear .
what fool is this ?
oh , that i were a fool !
propn be with my old master .
he would not have spoke such a word .
is it even so ?
begin you to grow upon me ?
i will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither .— propn , propn !
calls your worship ?
was not propn , the duke ’ s wrestler , here to speak with me ?
so please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
call him in .
propn be a good way , and tomorrow the wrestling is .
i must have liberty propn , as large a charter as the wind , to blow on whom i please , for so fools have .
and they that are most gallèd with my folly , they most must laugh .
and why , sir , must they so ?
the “ why ” is plain as way to parish church : he that a fool doth very wisely hit propn very foolishly , although he smart , not to seem senseless of the bob .
invest me in my motley .
give me leave to speak my mind , and i will through and through propn the foul body of th ' infected world , if they will patiently receive my medicine .
fie on thee !
i can tell what thou wouldst do .
what , for a counter , would i do but good ?
most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin , for thou thyself hast been a libertine , as sensual as the brutish sting itself , and all th ' embossèd sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught propn thou disgorge into the general world .
who can come in and say that i mean her , when such a one as she such is her neighbor ?
forbear , and eat no more .
why , i have eat none yet .
nor shalt not till necessity be served .
of what kind should this cock come of ?
art thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress or else a rude despiser of good manners , that in civility thou propn so empty ?
you touched my vein at first .
but forbear , i say .
an you will not be answered with reason , i must die .
what would you have ?
your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness .
i almost die for food , and let me have it .
sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
speak you so gently ?
pardon me , i pray you .
i thought that all things had been savage here , and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment .
true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolled to church , and sat at good men ’ s feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendered .
then but forbear your food a little while propn , like a doe , i go to find my fawn and give it food .
there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limped in pure love .
i thank you ; and be blessed for your good comfort .
thou seest we are not all alone unhappy .
all the world propn a stage , and all the men and women merely players .
they have their exits and their entrances , and one man in his time plays many parts , his acts being seven ages .
at first the infant , mewling and puking in the nurse ’ s arms .
then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face , creeping like snail unwillingly to school .
and then the justice , in fair round belly with good capon lined , with eyes severe and beard of formal cut , full of wise saws and modern instances ; and so he plays his part .
welcome .
set down your venerable burden , and let him feed .
i thank you most for him .
welcome .
fall to .
i will not trouble you as yet to question you about your fortunes.— give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
as if time were in debt .
how fondly dost thou reason !
bear it straight , and bring thy master home immediately .
there ’ s not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their well - acquainted friend , and every one doth call me by my name .
some tender money to me ; some invite me ; some other give me thanks for kindnesses ; some offer me commodities to buy .
even now a tailor called me in his shop and showed me silks that he had bought for me , and therewithal took measure of my body .
sure , these are but imaginary wiles , and lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
propn , here ’ s the gold you sent me for .
what propn dost thou mean ?
not that propn that kept the propn , but that propn that keeps the prison ; he that goes in the calf ’ s skin that was killed for the propn ; he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .
i understand thee not .
no ?
what , thou meanest an officer ?
ay , sir , the sergeant of the band ; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band ; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says “ propn give you good rest . ” well , sir , there rest in your foolery .
is there any ships put forth tonight ?
may we be gone ?
why , sir , i brought you word an hour since that the bark the fellow is distract , and so am i , and here we wander in illusions .
some blessed power deliver us from hence !
well met , well met , propn propn .
i see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now .
is that the chain you promised me today ?
propn , avoid !
i charge thee , tempt me not .
propn , is this propn propn ?
it is the devil .
nay , she is worse ; she is the devil ’ s dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench .
propn is an effect of fire , and fire will burn : ergo , light wenches will burn .
your man and you are marvelous merry , sir .
will you go with me ?
we ’ ll mend our dinner here .
propn , if you do , expect spoon meat ; or bespeak a long spoon .
why , propn ?
i pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain .
i hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
propn , thou witch ! —come , propn , let us go .
propn , that you know .
now , out of doubt propn is mad ; else would he never so demean himself .
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , and for the same he promised me a chain .
both one and other he denies me now .
the reason that i gather he is mad , besides this present instance of his rage , is a mad tale he told today at dinner of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
propn his wife , acquainted with his fits , on purpose shut the doors against his way .
my way is now to hie home to his house and tell his wife that , being lunatic , he rushed into my house and took perforce my ring away .
this course i fittest choose , for forty ducats is too much to lose .
five summers have i spent in farthest propn , roaming clean through the bounds of propn , and , coasting homeward , came to propn , propn to find , yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbors men .
but though thou art adjudgèd to the death , and passèd sentence may not be recalled but to our honour ’ s great disparagement , yet will i favor thee in what i can .
therefore , merchant , i ’ ll limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help .
i will , my lord .
fear me not , man .
i tell you , ’ twill sound harshly in her ears .
here comes my man .
i think he brings the money .
how now , sir ?
have you that i sent you for ?
here ’ s that , i warrant you , will pay them all .
but where ’ s the money ?
why , sir , i gave the money for the rope .
i ’ ll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
to what end did i bid thee hie thee home ?
to a rope ’ s end , sir , and to that end am i returned .
and to that end , sir , i will welcome you .
good sir , be patient .
good now , hold thy tongue .
nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
i would i were senseless , sir , that i might not feel your blows .
thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
i am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears .— i have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
nay , i bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wo nt her brat , and i think when he hath lamed me , i shall beg with it from door to door .
come , go along .
my wife is coming yonder .
propn , propn thou still talk ?
how say you now ?
is not your husband mad ?
mark how he trembles in his ecstasy .
i conjure thee by all the saints in propn .
peace , doting wizard , peace .
i am not mad .
o , that thou wert not , poor distressèd soul !
you minion , you , are these your customers ?
did this companion with the saffron face propn and feast it at my house today whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut and i denied to enter in my house ?
dined at home ” ?
thou villain , what sayest thou ?
propn , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
were not my doors locked up and i shut out ?
propn , your doors were locked , and you shut out .
and did not she herself revile me there ?
sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
did not her kitchen maid rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
and did not i in rage depart from thence ?
in verity you did .— my bones bear witness , that since have felt the vigour of his rage .
it is no shame .
alas , i sent you money to redeem you by propn here , who came in haste for it .
money by me !
went ’ st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
he came to me , and i delivered it .
and i am witness with her that she did .
propn and the rope - maker bear me witness that i was sent for nothing but a rope .
propn , both man and master is possessed .
i know it by their pale and deadly looks .
they must be bound and laid in some dark room .
i did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
and , gentle master , i received no gold .
but i confess , sir , that we were locked out .
let him not come near me .
more company !
the fiend is strong within him .
what , will you murder me ? — thou jailer , thou , i am thy prisoner .
wilt thou suffer them to make a rescue ?
masters , let him go .
he is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
go , bind this man , for he is frantic too .
he is my prisoner .
if i let him go , the debt he owes will be required of me .
i will discharge thee ere i go from thee .
bear me forthwith unto his creditor , and , knowing how the debt grows , i will pay propn propn propn propn , see him safe conveyed home to my house .
o most unhappy day !
o most unhappy strumpet !
propn , i am here entered in bond for you .
how idly do they talk !
one propn , a goldsmith .
do you know him ?
i know the man .
two hundred ducats .
say , how grows it due ?
due for a chain your husband had of him .
he did bespeak a chain for me but had it not .
i long to know the truth hereof at large .
propn for propn mercy , they are loose again !
and come with naked swords .
let ’ s call more help to have them bound again .
away !
they ’ ll kill us .
i see these witches are afraid of swords .
she that would be your wife now ran from you .
i long that we were safe and sound aboard .
faith , stay here this night .
they will surely do us no harm .
you saw they speak us fair , give us gold .
methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
that claims marriage of me , i could find in my heart to stay here still , and turn witch .
i will not stay tonight for all the town .
therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
how is the man esteemed here in the city ?
his word might bear my wealth at any time .
speak softly .
propn so ; and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have .
good sir , draw near to me .
therefore give out you are of propn , propn that your goods too soon be confiscate .
there is your money that i had to keep .
go bear it to the propn , where we host , and stay there , propn , till i come to thee .
within this hour it will be dinnertime .
till that , i ’ ll view the manners of the town , propn the traders , gaze upon the buildings , and then return and sleep within mine inn , for with long travel i am stiff and weary .
get thee away .
many a man would take you at your word and go indeed , having so good a mean .
a trusty villain , sir , that very oft , when i am dull with care and melancholy , propn my humor with his merry jests .
what , will you walk with me about the town and then go to my inn and dine with me ?
i think i had .
i never did deny it .
yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
these ears of mine , thou know ’ st did hear thee .
fie on thee , wretch .
propn pity that thou propn to walk where any honest men resort .
thou art a villain to impeach me thus .
i ’ ll prove mine honor and mine honesty against thee presently if thou propn stand .
i dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
run , master , run .
for propn ’ s sake , take a house .
this is some priory .
in , or we are spoiled .
be quiet , people .
wherefore throng you hither ?
to fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
let us come in , that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery .
how long hath this possession held the man ?
this week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , and much different from the man he was .
but till this afternoon his passion propn brake into extremity of rage .
propn not else his eye stray ’ d his affection in unlawful love , a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing ?
which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
you should for that have reprehended him .
why , so i did .
ay , but not rough enough .
haply in private .
and in assemblies too .
ay , but not enough .
alone , it was the subject of my theme ; in company i often glancèd it .
still did i tell him it was vile and bad .
and thereof came it that the man was mad .
the venom clamors of a jealous woman propn more deadly than a mad dog ’ s tooth .
thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .
thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls .
in food , in sport , and life - preserving rest to be disturbed , would mad or man or beast .
the consequence is , then , thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
good people , enter and lay hold on him .
then let your servants bring my husband forth .
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath , a charitable duty of my order .
therefore depart and leave him here with me .
be quiet and depart .
thou shalt not have him .
complain unto the propn of this indignity .
come , go .
i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the propn .
by this , i think , the dial points at five .
to see a reverend syracusian merchant , who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town , beheaded publicly for his offense .
see where they come .
we will behold his death .
kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
yet once again proclaim it publicly , if any friend will pay the sum for him , he shall not die ; so much we tender him .
propn , most sacred duke , against the propn .
she is a virtuous and a reverend lady .
it can not be that she hath done thee wrong .
therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
long since thy husband served me in my wars , and i to thee engaged a prince ’ s word , when thou didst make him master of thy bed , to do him all the grace and good i could .
peace , fool .
thy master and his man are here , and that is false thou dost report to us .
propn , upon my life i tell you true .
i have not breathed almost since i did see it .
he cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , to scorch your face and to disfigure you .
ay me , it is my husband .
witness you that he is borne about invisible .
even now we housed him in the abbey here , and now he ’ s there , past thought of human reason .
even for the blood that then i lost for thee , now grant me justice .
beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
this day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me while she with harlots feasted in my house .
a grievous fault .— say , woman , didst thou so ?
no , my good lord .
myself , he , and my sister today did dine together .
so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal .
ne'er may i look on day , nor sleep on night but she tells to your propn simple truth .
o perjured woman !
my liege , i am advisèd what i say , neither disturbed with the effect of wine , nor heady - rash , provoked with raging ire , propn my wrongs might make one wiser mad .
that goldsmith there , were he not packed with her , could witness it , for he was with me then , who parted with me to go fetch a chain , propn to bring it to the propn , where propn and i did dine together .
our dinner done and he not coming thither , i went to seek him .
in the street i met him , and in his company that gentleman .
by th ' way we met my wife , her sister , and a rabble more of vile confederates .
along with them they brought one propn , a hungry , lean - faced villain , a mere anatomy , a mountebank , a threadbare juggler , and a fortune - teller , a needy , hollow - eyed , sharp - looking wretch , a living dead man .
this pernicious slave , propn , took on him as a conjurer , and , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse ,
but had he such a chain of thee or no ?
he had , my lord , and when he ran in here , these people saw the chain about his neck .
i never saw the chain , so help me propn , and this is false you burden me withal .
why , what an intricate impeach is this !
soon at five o'clock , please you , i ’ ll meet with you upon the mart and afterward consort you till bedtime .
my present business calls me from you now .
farewell till then .
i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city .
propn , i commend you to your own content .
he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i can not get .
i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop , who , falling there to find his fellow forth , unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself .
so i , to find a mother and a brother , in quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
how chance thou art returned so soon ?
returned so soon ?
rather approach ’ d too late !
the capon burns ; the pig falls from the spit ; the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell ; my mistress made it one upon my cheek .
you say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here denies that saying .
propn , he dined with her there , at the propn .
he did , and from my finger snatched that ring .
propn true , my liege ; this ring i had of her .
saw ’ st thou him enter at the abbey here ?
as sure , my liege , as i do see your grace .
i think you are all mated or stark mad .
most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word .
haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me .
within this hour i was his bondman sir , but he , i thank him , gnawed in two my cords .
now am i propn , and his man , unbound .
i am sure you both of you remember me .
you are not propn ’ s patient , are you , sir ?
why look you strange on me ?
you know me well .
i never saw you in my life till now .
o , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , and careful hours with time ’ s deformèd hand have written strange defeatures in my face .
but tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ?
neither .
propn , nor thou ?
no , trust me , sir , nor i. i am sure thou dost .
not know my voice !
o time ’ s extremity , propn thou so crack ’ d and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
though now this grainèd face of mine be hid in sap - consuming winter ’ s drizzled snow , and all the conduits of my blood froze up , yet hath my night of life some memory , my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , my dull deaf ears a little use to hear .
all these old witnesses — i can not err— tell me thou art my son propn .
i never saw my father in my life .
but seven years since , in propn , boy , thou know ’ st we parted .
i see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
most mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .
i see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
i , sir , am propn .
command him away .
i , sir , am propn .
please , let me stay .
o , my old master .— who hath bound him here ?
whoever bound him , i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty.— speak , old propn , if thou be ’ st the man that hadst a wife once called propn , that bore thee at a burden two fair sons .
o , if thou be ’ st the same propn , speak , and speak unto the same propn .
why , here begins his morning story right ; these two propn , these two so like , and these two propn , one in semblance— besides her urging of her wreck at sea— these are the parents to these children , which accidentally are met together .
if i dream not , thou art propn .
if thou art she , tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
propn first .
stay , stand apart .
i know not which is which .
i came from propn , my most gracious lord .
and i with him .
brought to this town by that most famous warrior propn propn , your most renownèd uncle .
which of you two did dine with me today ?
i , gentle mistress .
and are not you my husband ?
that is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
i think it be , sir .
i deny it not .
and you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
i think i did , sir .
i deny it not .
i sent you money , sir , to be your bail by propn , but i think he brought it not .
no , none by me .
this purse of ducats i received from you , and propn my man did bring them me .
these ducats pawn i for my father here .
it shall not need .
thy father hath his life .
propn , i must have that diamond from you .
there , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
renownèd duke , vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes , and all that are assembled in this place that by this sympathizèd one day ’ s error have suffered wrong .
go , keep us company , and we shall make full satisfaction.— thirty - three years have i but gone in travail of you , my sons , and till this present hour my heavy burden ne'er deliverèd.— propn propn , my husband , and my children both , and you , the calendars of their nativity , go to a gossips ' feast , and go with me .
after so long grief , such nativity !
with all my heart i ’ ll gossip at this feast .
propn , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked ?
your goods that lay at host , sir , in the propn .
he speaks to me .— i am your master , propn .
there is a fat friend at your master ’ s house that kitchened me for you today at dinner .
she now shall be my sister , not my wife .
methinks you are my glass , and not my brother : i see by you i am a sweet - faced youth .
will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
not i , sir .
you are my elder .
that ’ s a question .
how shall we try it ?
we ’ ll draw cuts for the signior .
till then , lead thou first .
nay , then , thus : we came into the world like brother and brother , and now let ’ s go hand in hand , not one before another .
stop in your wind , sir .
tell me this , i pray : where have you left the money that i gave you ?
o , sixpence , that i had o ' propn last to pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ?
the saddler had it , sir ; i kept it not .
i am not in a sportive humor now .
tell me , and dally not : where is the money ?
we being strangers here , how propn thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody ?
i pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner .
methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , and strike you home without a messenger .
come , propn , come , these jests are out of season .
reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
where is the gold i gave in charge to thee ?
to me , sir ?
why , you gave no gold to me !
come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
my charge was but to fetch you from the propn propn to your house , the propn , sir , to dinner .
my mistress and her sister stays for you .
now , as i am a propn , answer me in what safe place you have bestowed my money , or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undisposed .
where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
thy mistress ' marks ?
what mistress , slave , hast thou ?
what , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , being forbid ?
there , take you that , sir knave .
what mean you , sir ?
for propn ’ s sake , hold your hands .
nay , an you will not , sir , i ’ ll take my heels .
upon my life , by some device or other the villain is o'erraught of all my money .
they say this town is full of cozenage , as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , propn - working sorcerers that change the mind , soul - killing witches that deform the body , disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , and many suchlike liberties of sin .
neither my husband nor the slave returned that in such haste i sent to seek his master ?
sure , propn , it is two o'clock .
perhaps some merchant hath invited him , and from the mart he ’ s somewhere gone to dinner .
good sister , let us dine and never fret .
a man is master of his liberty ; propn is their master , and when they see time they ’ ll go or come .
if so , be patient , sister .
why should their liberty than ours be more ?
because their business still lies out o ' door .
why , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe .
then let your will attend on their accords .
this servitude makes you to keep unwed .
not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
but , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
propn i learn love , i ’ ll practice to obey .
how if your husband start some otherwhere ?
till he come home again , i would forbear .
patience unmoved !
no marvel though she pause ; they can be meek that have no other cause .
a wretched soul , bruised with adversity we bid be quiet when we hear it cry , but were we burdened with like weight of pain , as much or more we should ourselves complain .
so thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , with urging helpless patience would relieve me ; but , if thou live to see like right bereft , this fool - begged patience in thee will be left .
well , i will marry one day , but to try .
say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
propn thou his mind ?
but say , i prithee , is he coming home ?
it seems he hath great care to please his wife .
why , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .
horn mad , thou villain !
i mean not cuckold mad , but sure he is stark mad .
my mistress , sir , ” quoth i .
hang up thy mistress !
quoth my master .
i know , ” quoth he , “ no house , no wife , no mistress . ” so that my errand , due unto my tongue , i thank him , i bare home upon my shoulders , for , in conclusion , he did beat me there .
go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
go back again and be new beaten home ?
for propn ’ s sake , send some other messenger .
back , slave , or i will break thy pate across .
hence , prating peasant !
fetch thy master home .
you spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither .
if i last in this service , you must case me in leather .
propn , how impatience loureth in your face .
his company must do his minions grace , whilst i at home starve for a merry look .
propn homely age th ' alluring beauty took from my poor cheek ?
propn my wit ?
my decayèd fair a sunny look of his would soon repair .
but , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale and feeds from home .
poor i am but his stale .
self - harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere , or else what lets it but he would be here ?
sister , you know he promised me a chain .
would that alone o ' love he would detain , so he would keep fair quarter with his bed .
i see the jewel best enamelèd will lose his beauty .
yet the gold bides still that others touch , and often touching will wear gold ; yet no man that hath a name by falsehood and corruption doth it shame .
since that my beauty can not please his eye , i ’ ll weep what ’ s left away , and weeping die .
how many fond fools serve mad jealousy !
propn , propn , to procure my fall , and by the doom of death end woes and all .
for , since the mortal and intestine jars ' propn thy seditious countrymen and us , it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the propn and ourselves , to admit no traffic to our adverse towns .
nay , more , if any born at propn be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs ; again , if any propn born come to the bay of propn , he dies , his goods confiscate to the propn ’ s dispose , unless a thousand marks be levièd to quit the penalty and to ransom him .
propn substance , valued at the highest rate , can not amount unto a hundred marks ; therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
the gold i gave to propn is laid up propn at the propn , and the heedful slave is wandered forth , in care to seek me out .
by computation and mine host ’ s report , i could not speak with propn since at first i sent him from the mart .
see , here he comes .
how now , sir ?
is your merry humor altered ?
you know no propn ?
you received no gold ?
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?
my house was at the propn ?
wast thou mad , that thus so madly thou didst answer me ?
what answer , sir ?
when spake i such a word ?
i did not see you since you sent me hence , home to the propn with the gold you gave me .
villain , thou didst deny the gold ’ s receipt and told ’ st me of a mistress and a dinner , for which , i hope , thou felt ’ st i was displeased .
i am glad to see you in this merry vein .
what means this jest ?
i pray you , master , tell me ?
yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
think ’ st thou i jest ?
hold , take thou that and that .
hold , sir , for propn ’ s sake !
now your jest is earnest .
upon what bargain do you give it me ?
because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you , your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours .
sconce ” call you it ?
shall i tell you why ?
well , sir , i thank you .
marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
i ’ ll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
but say , sir , is it dinnertime ?
in good time , sir , what ’ s that ?
basting .
well , sir , then ’ twill be dry .
if it be , sir , i pray you , eat none of it .
your reason ?
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
well , sir , learn to jest in good time .
there ’ s a time for all things .
i durst have denied that before you were so choleric .
by what rule , sir ?
marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of propn propn himself .
let ’ s hear it .
there ’ s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
why is propn such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
why , but there ’ s many a man hath more hair than wit .
why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
for what reason ?
for two , and sound ones too .
nay , not sound , i pray you .
sure ones , then .
nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
certain ones , then .
name them .
the one , to save the money that he spends in tiring ; the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
thus i mend it : time himself is bald and therefore , to the world ’ s end , will have bald followers .
the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear , that never object pleasing in thine eye , that never touch well welcome to thy hand , that never meat sweet - savored in thy taste , unless i spake , or looked , or touched , or carved to thee .
how comes it now , my husband , o , how comes it that thou art thus estranged from thyself ?
ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
i know you not .
when were you wo nt to use my sister thus ?
she sent for you by propn home to dinner .
by propn ?
by thee ; and this thou didst return from him : that he did buffet thee and , in his blows , denied my house for his , me for his wife .
did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
what is the course and drift of your compact ?
i , sir ?
i never saw her till this time .
villain , thou liest ; for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
i never spake with her in all my life .
what , was i married to her in my dream ?
or sleep i now and think i hear all this ?
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?
until i know this sure uncertainty i ’ ll entertain the offered fallacy .
propn , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
o , for my beads !
i cross me for a sinner .
this is the fairy land .
o spite of spites !
we talk with goblins , owls , and sprites : if we obey them not , this will ensue : they ’ ll suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
why propn thou to thyself and answer ’ st not ?
propn — propn , propn — thou snail , thou slug , thou sot .
i am transformèd , master , am i not ?
i think thou art in mind , and so am propn propn , master , both in mind and in my shape .
propn true .
i am an ass ; else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me .
come , come , no longer will i be a fool , to put the finger in the eye and weep propn man and master laugh my woes to scorn .
come , sir , to dinner .— propn , keep the gate .
propn , i ’ ll dine above with you today , and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
am i in earth , in propn , or in hell ?
known unto these , and to myself disguised !
propn , shall i be porter at the gate ?
ay ; and let none enter , lest i break your pate .
well , propn , say in brief the cause why thou dep - artedst from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to propn .
in propn was i born , and we d unto a woman happy but for me , and by me , had not our hap been bad .
that very hour , and in the selfsame inn , a meaner woman was deliverèd of such a burden , male twins , both alike .
unwilling , i agreed .
alas , too soon we came aboard .
propn propn propn , you must excuse us all ; my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours .
say that i lingered with you at your shop to see the making of her carcanet , and that tomorrow you will bring it home .
but here ’ s a villain that would face me down he met me on the mart , and that i beat him and charged him with a thousand marks in gold , and that i did deny my wife and house.— propn drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this ?
say what you will , sir , but i know what i know .
i think thou art an ass .
you ’ re sad , propn propn .
i hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .
and welcome more common , for that ’ s nothing but words .
small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
ay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest .
but though my cates be mean , take them in good part .
better cheer may you have , but not with better heart .
but soft !
my door is lock ’ d .
propn , propn , propn , propn , propn , propn !
my master stays in the street .
who talks within there ?
propn , open the door .
wherefore ?
for my dinner .
i have not dined today .
what art thou that keep ’ st me out from the house i owe ?
o villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !
o propn , i must laugh .
have at you with a proverb : shall i set in my staff ?
do you hear , you minion ?
you ’ ll let us in , i hope ?
so , come , help .
well struck !
there was blow for blow .
thou baggage , let me in .
propn , knock the door hard .
you ’ ll cry for this , minion , if i beat the door down .
are you there , wife ?
you might have come before .
if you went in pain , master , this knave would go sore .
in debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
you would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .
it would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
go , fetch me something : i ’ ll break ope the gate .
here ’ s too much “ out upon thee ! ” i pray thee , let me in .
well , i ’ ll break in .
go , borrow me a crow .
a crow without feather ?
propn , mean you so ?
for a fish without a fin , there ’ s a fowl without a feather.— go , get thee gone .
fetch me an iron crow .
have patience , sir .
o , let it not be so .
and doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse why at this time the doors are made against you .
be ruled by me ; depart in patience , and let us to the propn all to dinner , and about evening come yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint .
you have prevailed .
i will depart in quiet and , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
i know a wench of excellent discourse , pretty and witty , wild and yet , too , gentle .
there will we dine .
that chain will i bestow— be it for nothing but to spite my wife— upon mine hostess there .
i ’ ll meet you at that place some hour hence .
do so .
this jest shall cost me some expense .
propn , propn , even in the spring of love thy love - springs rot ?
if you did we d my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth ’ s sake use her with more kindness .
what simple thief brags of his own attaint ?
propn double wrong to truant with your bed and let her read it in thy looks at board .
though others have the arm , show us the sleeve ; we in your motion turn , and you may move us .
then , gentle brother , get you in again .
sweet mistress — what your name is else i know not , nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , —
less in your knowledge and your grace you show not than our earth ’ s wonder , more than earth divine .
teach me , dear creature , how to think and speak .
against my soul ’ s pure truth why labour you to make it wander in an unknown field ?
are you a god ?
would you create me new ?
transform me , then , and to your power i ’ ll yield .
but if that i am i , then well i know your weeping sister is no wife of mine , nor to her bed no homage do i owe .
far more , far more , to you do i decline .
o , train me not , sweet mermaid , with thy note to drown me in thy sister ’ s flood of tears .
what , are you mad that you do reason so ?
it is a fault that springeth from your eye .
for gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
why call you me “ love ” ?
call my sister so .
propn sister ’ s sister .
that ’ s my sister .
no , it is thyself , mine own self ’ s better part , propn eye ’ s clear eye , my dear heart ’ s dearer heart , my food , my fortune , and my sweet hope ’ s aim , my sole earth ’ s heaven , and my propn ’ s claim .
all this my sister is , or else should be .
call thyself “ sister , ” sweet , for i am thee .
give me thy hand .
o soft , sir !
hold you still .
i ’ ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill .
why , how now , propn .
where propn thou so fast ?
do you know me , sir ?
am i dromio ?
am i your man ?
am i myself ?
the children thus disposed , my wife and i , fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed , fastened ourselves at either end the mast and , floating straight , obedient to the stream , was carried towards propn , as we thought .
but ere they came , – o , let me say no more !
thou art propn , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
i am an ass , i am a woman ’ s man , and besides myself .
what woman ’ s man ?
and how besides thyself ?
what claim lays she to thee ?
what is she ?
marry , sir , she ’ s the kitchen wench , and all grease , and i know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light .
i warrant her rags and the
if she lives till doomsday , she ’ ll burn a week longer than the whole world .
what complexion is she of ?
swart like my shoe , but her face nothing like so clean kept .
that ’ s a fault that water will mend .
no , sir , ’ tis in grain ; propn ’ s flood could not do it .
what ’ s her name ?
then she bears some breadth ?
she is spherical , like a globe .
in what part of her body stands propn ?
marry , sir , in her buttocks .
faith , i saw it not , but i felt it hot in her breath .
where propn , the propn ?
o , sir , upon her nose , all o'er - embellished with rubies , carbuncles , sapphires , declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of propn , who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose .
and , i think , if my breast had not been made of faith , and my heart of steel , she had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i ' th ' wheel .
an if the wind blow any way from shore , i will not harbor in this town tonight .
if any bark put forth , come to the mart , where i will walk till thou return to me .
if every one knows us , and we know none , ' propn time , i think , to trudge , pack , and be gone .
as from a bear a man would run for life , so fly i from her that would be my wife .
there ’ s none but witches do inhabit here , and therefore ’ tis high time that i were hence .
she that doth call me husband , even my soul doth for a wife abhor .
but lest myself be guilty to self wrong , i ’ ll stop mine ears against the mermaid ’ s song .
i know it well , sir .
propn , here ’ s the chain .
what is your will that i shall do with this ?
i have made it for you .
made it for me , sir ?
i bespoke it not .
not once , nor twice , but twenty times you have .
you are a merry man , sir .
fare you well .
what i should think of this i can not tell , but this i think : there ’ s no man is so vain that would refuse so fair an offered chain .
i ’ ll to the mart , and there for propn stay .
if any ship put out , then straight away .
even just the sum that i do owe to you is growing to me by propn .
at five o'clock i shall receive the money for the same .
propn you walk with me down to his house , i will discharge my bond and thank you too .
saving your merry humor , here ’ s the note how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat , the fineness of the gold , and chargeful fashion , which doth amount to three - odd ducats more than i stand debted to this gentleman .
i pray you , see him presently discharged , for he is bound to sea , and stays but for it .
i am not furnished with the present money .
besides , i have some business in the town .
then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
well , sir , i will .
have you the chain about you ?
nay , come , i pray you , sir , give me the chain .
both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , and i , to blame , have held him here too long .
good propn !
you use this dalliance to excuse your breach of promise to the propn .
i should have chid you for not bringing it , but , like a shrew , you first begin to brawl .
the hour steals on .
i pray you , sir , dispatch .
you hear how he importunes me .
the chain !
why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
come , come .
you know i gave it you even now .
either send the chain , or send me by some token .
propn , now you run this humor out of breath .
come , where ’ s the chain ?
i pray you , let me see it .
i answer you ?
what should i answer you ?
the money that you owe me for the chain .
i owe you none till i receive the chain .
you know i gave it you half an hour since .
you wrong me more , sir , in denying it .
consider how it stands upon my credit .
well , officer , arrest him at my suit .
i do , this touches me in reputation .
consent to pay thee that i never had ? — arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou propn .
here is thy fee .
arrest him , officer .
i would not spare my brother in this case if he should scorn me so apparently .
i do arrest you , sir .
you hear the suit .
i do obey thee till i give thee bail .
but , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear as all the metal in your shop will answer .
propn , sir , i will have law in propn , to your notorious shame , i doubt it not .
nay , forward , old man .
do not break off so , for we may pity though not pardon thee .
o , had the gods done so , i had not now worthily termed them merciless to us .
thus have you heard me severed from my bliss ; that by misfortunes was my life prolonged to tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for , do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befall'n of them and thee till now .
our fraughtage , sir , i have conveyed aboard , and i have bought the oil , the balsamum and aqua vitae .
why , thou peevish sheep , what ship of propn stays for me ?
a ship you sent me to , to hire waftage .
thou drunken slave , i sent thee for a rope and told thee to what purpose and what end .
you sent me for a rope ’ s end as soon .
you sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
i will debate this matter at more leisure and teach your ears to list me with more heed .
to propn , villain , hie thee straight .
give her this key , and tell her in the desk that ’ s cover ’ d o'er with turkish tapestry there is a purse of ducats .
let her send it .
tell her i am arrested in the street , and that shall bail me .
hie thee , slave .
propn on , officer , to prison till it come .
to propn .
that is where we dined , where propn did claim me for her husband .
she is too big , i hope , for me to compass .
propn i must , although against my will , for servants must their masters ' minds fulfill .
ah , propn , did he tempt thee so ?
looked he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ?
first he denied you had in him no right .
he meant he did me none ; the more my spite .
then swore he that he was a stranger here .
then pleaded i for you .
and what said he ?
that love i begged for you he begged of me .
with what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
have patience , i beseech .
who would be jealous , then , of such a one ?
no evil lost is wailed when it is gone .
ah , but i think him better than i say , and yet would herein others ' eyes were worse .
my heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
how hast thou lost thy breath ?
by running fast .
where is thy master , propn ?
is he well ?
no , he ’ s in propn limbo , worse than hell .
the passages of alleys , creeks , and narrow lands ; a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , one that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell .
why , man , what is the matter ?
tell me at whose suit .
i know not at whose suit he is arrested well , but he ’ s in a suit of buff which ’ rested him ; that can i tell .
go fetch it , sister .
this i wonder at , that he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
do you not hear it ring ?
what , the chain ?
no , no , the bell .
propn time that i were gone .
it was two ere i left him , and now the clock strikes one .
that did i never hear .
excellent well .
you are a fishmonger .
not i , my lord .
then i would you were so honest a man .
honest , my lord ?
ay , sir .
to be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
that ’ s very true , my lord .
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion— have you a daughter ?
i have , my lord .
let her not walk i ' th ' sun .
conception is a blessing , but , as your daughter may conceive — friend , look to propn .
words , words , words .
what is the matter , my lord ?
between who ?
i mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
slanders , sir .
into my grave .
indeed , that is out of the air .
you can not , sir , take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal — except my life , except my life , except my life .
fare you well , my lord .
you go to seek the propn propn .
there he is .
propn save you , sir !
my honored lord !
my most dear lord !
my excellent good friends !
how dost thou , guildenstern ?
ah , propn !
good lads , how do you both ?
happy , in that we are not overhappy .
on propn ’ s cap we are not the very button .
then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
faith , her privates we .
what news ?
but your news is not true .
let me question more in particular .
what have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
prison , my lord ?
propn propn a prison .
then is the world one .
a goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , propn being one o ' th ' worst .
we think not so , my lord .
why , then , ’ tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .
to me it is a prison .
why then , your ambition makes it one .
propn too narrow for your mind .
which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
a dream itself is but a shadow .
truly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow ’ s shadow .
then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .
shall we to th ' court ?
beggar that i am , i am even poor in thanks ; but i thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .
is it your own inclining ?
what should we say , my lord ?
you were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color .
i know the good king and queen have sent for you .
to what end , my lord ?
that you must teach me .
my lord , we were sent for .
what might be toward , that this sweaty haste propn make the night joint laborer with the day ?
who is propn that can inform me ?
that can i .
i will tell you why .
why did you laugh then , when i said “ man delights not me ” ?
he that plays the king shall be welcome .
the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target , the lover shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace , the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o ' th ' sear , and the lady shall say her mind freely , or the blank verse shall halt for propn .
what players are they ?
even those you were wo nt to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
how chances it they travel ?
their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city ?
are they so followed ?
no , indeed are they not .
how comes it ?
do they grow rusty ?
nay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace .
but there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for propn .
these are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages — so they call them — that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither .
what , are they children ?
who maintains 'em ?
how are they escoted ?
will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?
will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players ( as it is most like if their means are no better ) , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?
faith , there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy .
there was , for a while , no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question .
is ’ t possible ?
oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
do the boys carry it away ?
it is not very strange .
for my uncle is propn of propn , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .
sblood , there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .
there are the players .
gentlemen , you are welcome to propn .
your hands , come then .
let me comply with you in this garb — lest my extent to the players , which , i tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours .
you are welcome .
but my uncle - father and aunt - mother are deceived .
in what , my dear lord ?
i am but mad north - north - west .
when the wind is southerly , i know a hawk from a handsaw .
well be with you , gentlemen .
propn you , propn , and you too — at each ear a hearer .
happily he ’ s the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
my lord , i have news to tell you .
my lord , i have news to tell you .
when propn was an actor in propn the actors are come hither , my lord .
buzz , buzz .
upon my honor— then came each actor on his ass—
why , am i not i ' th ' right , old propn ?
if you call me propn , my lord , i have a daughter that i love passing well .
what follows , then , my lord ?
why ,
you are welcome , masters , welcome , propn am glad to see thee well .— welcome , good friends .— o old friend ?
what speech , my good lord ?
but it was — as i received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine — an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning .
one speech in it i chiefly loved .
this is too long .
it shall to the barber propn , with your beard .— prithee , say on .
the moblèd queen ” ?
that ’ s good .
propn queen ” is good .
look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in ’ s eyes .— prithee , no more .
my lord , i will use them according to their desert .
propn ’ s bodykins , man , much better .
use them after your own honor and dignity .
the less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
take them in .
come , sirs .
follow him , friends .
we ’ ll hear a play tomorrow .
ay , my lord .
we ’ ll ha propn tomorrow night .
you could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in propn , could you not ?
ay , my lord .
very well .
follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
my good friends , i ’ ll leave you till night .
you are welcome to propn .
good my lord .
now i am alone .
oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am i !
and all for nothing— for propn !
and terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands so by his father lost .
in the most high and palmy state of propn , a little ere the mightiest propn fell , the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , disasters in the sun , and the moist star upon whose influence propn ’ s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse .
but soft , behold !
propn , where it comes again .
i ’ ll cross it though it blast me .— stay , illusion !
if thou hast any sound or use of voice , speak to me .
am i a coward ?
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
tweaks me by the nose ?
who does me this ?
bloody , bawdy villain !
remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
o vengeance !
why , what an ass am i !
propn upon propn , foh !
for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
if he do blench , i know my course .
i ’ ll have grounds more relative than this .
the play ’ s the thing wherein i ’ ll catch the conscience of the king .
and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion , grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
did he receive you well ?
most like a gentleman .
propn of question , but of our demands most free in his reply .
propn , it so fell out , that certain players we o'erraught on the way .
they are about the court , and , as i think , they have already order this night to play before him .
propn most true , and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter .
with all my heart , and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined .
good gentlemen , give him a further edge , and drive his purpose on to these delights .
we shall , my lord .
i shall obey you .
propn , i wish it may .
propn , walk you here .
let ’ s withdraw , my lord .
to die , to sleep— no more — and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to— ’ tis a consummation devoutly to be wished !
to die , to sleep .
there ’ s the respect that makes calamity of so long life .
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , propn ' oppressor ’ s wrong , the proud man ’ s contumely , the pangs of despised love , the law ’ s delay , the insolence of office , and the spurns that patient merit of th ' unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ?
who would fardels bear , to grunt and sweat under a weary life , but that the dread of something after death , the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns , puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of ?
good my lord , how does your honor for this many a day ?
i humbly thank you .
well , well , well .
my lord , i have remembrances of yours that i have longèd long to redeliver .
i pray you now receive them .
there , my lord .
ha , ha , are you honest ?
my lord ?
are you fair ?
what means your lordship ?
that if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
ay , truly , for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness .
this was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .
i did love you once .
indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
i loved you not .
i was the more deceived .
get thee to a nunnery .
i am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and propn ?
we are arrant knaves , all .
believe none of us .
go thy ways to a nunnery .
where ’ s your father ?
at home , my lord .
let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in ’ s own house .
propn .
o , help him , you sweet heavens !
get thee to a nunnery , go .
propn .
propn .
heavenly powers , restore him !
i have heard of your paintings too , well enough .
propn has given you one face and you make yourselves another .
you jig and amble , and you lisp , you nickname propn ’ s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance .
go to , i ’ ll no more on propn .
it hath made me mad .
i say , we will have no more marriages .
those that are married already , all but one , shall live .
the rest shall keep as they are .
to a nunnery , go .
love ?
his affections do not that way tend .
haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something - settled matter in his heart , propn his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself .
what think you on propn ?
it shall do well .
but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief propn from neglected love .— how now , propn ?
you need not tell us what propn propn said .
let her be round with him , and i ’ ll be placed , so please you , in the ear of all their conference .
if she find him not , to propn send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think .
it shall be so .
if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me , speak to me .
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth , for which , they say , you spirits oft walk in death , speak of it .
stay and speak !
stop it , propn .
shall i strike at it with my partisan ?
do , if it will not stand .
propn here .
propn here .
propn gone .
it was about to speak when the cock crew .
speak the speech , i pray you , as i pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .
oh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig - pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb - shows and noise .
i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing propn .
pray you , avoid it .
i warrant your honor .
be not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor .
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
o , reform it altogether !
and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered .
and the queen too , and that presently .
bid the players make haste .
will you two help to hasten them ?
ay , my lord .
what ho , propn !
here , sweet lord , at your service .
horatio , thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal .
o my dear lord— nay , do not think i flatter .
for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits , to feed and clothe thee ?
why should the poor be flattered ?
no , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning .
dost thou hear ?
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish , her election propn sealed thee for herself , for thou hast been— as one in suffering all that suffers nothing— a man that propn ’ s buffets and rewards propn ta'en with equal thanks .
give him heedful note .
they are coming to the play .
i must be idle .
get you a place .
how fares our cousin propn ?
excellent , i ' faith , of the chameleon ’ s dish .
i eat the air , promise - crammed .
you can not feed capons so .
i have nothing with this answer , propn .
these words are not mine .
no , nor mine now .
that did i , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
what did you enact ?
i did enact propn propn .
i was killed i ' th ' propn .
propn killed me .
ay , my lord .
they stay upon your patience .
no , good mother .
here ’ s metal more attractive .
propn , shall i lie in your lap ?
no , my lord .
i mean , my head upon your lap ?
ay , my lord .
do you think i meant country matters ?
what is , my lord ?
nothing .
you are merry , my lord .
who , i ?
ay , my lord .
o propn , your only jig - maker .
what should a man do but be merry ?
for , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
propn , ’ tis twice two months , my lord .
so long ?
nay then , let the devil wear black , for i ’ ll have a suit of sables .
then there ’ s hope a great man ’ s memory may outlive his life half a year .
but , by ' propn propn , he must build churches then , or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the hobby - horse , whose epitaph is “ for , oh , for , oh , the hobby - horse is forgot . ” what means this , my lord ?
marry , this is miching
propn this show imports the argument of the play .
we shall know by this fellow .
the players can not keep counsel .
they ’ ll tell all .
will he tell us what this show meant ?
ay , or any show that you will show him .
be not you ashamed to show , he ’ ll not shame to tell you what it means .
you are naught , you are naught .
i ’ ll mark the play .
is this a prologue or the posy of a ring ?
propn brief , my lord .
as woman ’ s love .
propn , how like you this play ?
the lady protests too much , methinks .
oh , but she ’ ll keep her word .
is there no offense in propn ?
no offense i ' th ' world .
what do you call the play ?
it faded on the crowing of the cock .
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , as needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
i could interpret between you and your love , if i could see the puppets dallying .
come , “ the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge— ”
the story is extant , and writ in choice italian .
you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of propn ’ s wife .
the king rises .
what , frighted with false fire ?
how fares my lord ?
give me some light , away !
propn , lights , lights !
a whole one , i .
didst perceive ?
very well , my lord .
upon the talk of the poisoning ?
i did very well note him .
ah ha !
come , some music !
come , the recorders !
come , some music !
good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
propn , a whole history .
the king , sir— ay , sir , what of him ?
is in his retirement marvelous distempered .
i am tame , sir .
pronounce .
the queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
you are welcome .
nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed .
if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer , i will do your mother ’ s commandment .
if not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
propn , i can not .
what , my lord ?
make you a wholesome answer .
my wit propn diseased .
therefore no more but to the matter .
o wonderful son that can so ’ stonish a mother !
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother ’ s admiration ?
impart .
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed .
we shall obey , were she ten times our mother .
have you any further trade with us ?
my lord , you once did love me .
and do still , by these pickers and stealers .
good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
propn , i lack advancement .
how can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in propn ?
i do not well understand that .
will you play upon this pipe ?
my lord , i can not .
i pray you .
believe me , i can not .
i do beseech you .
i know no touch of it , my lord .
it is as easy as lying .
but these can not i command to any utterance of harmony .
you would seem to know my stops .
sblood , do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , yet you can not play upon me .
propn bless you , sir .
my lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
do you see yonder cloud that ’ s almost in shape of a camel ?
by th ' mass , and ’ tis like a camel indeed .
methinks it is like a weasel .
it is backed like a weasel .
or like a whale .
very like a whale .
then i will come to my mother by and by .
i will say so .
propn now the very witching time of night , when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out propn to this world .
now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the bitter day would quake to look on .
i will speak daggers to her but use none .
my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites .
i like him not , nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range .
therefore prepare you .
i your commission will forthwith dispatch , and he to propn shall along with you .
the terms of our estate may not endure propn so dangerous as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies .
we will ourselves provide .
the cease of majesty dies not alone , but , like a gulf , doth draw what ’ s near it with it .
it is a massy wheel fixed on the summit of the highest mount , to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortised and adjoined , which , when it falls , each small annexment , petty consequence , attends the boisterous ruin .
never alone did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
arm you , i pray you , to this speedy voyage .
for we will fetters put upon this fear , which now goes too free - footed .
we will haste us .
my lord , he ’ s going to his mother ’ s closet .
behind the arras i ’ ll convey myself to hear the process .
i ’ ll warrant she ’ ll tax him home .
and , as you said ( and wisely was it said ) ' propn meet that some more audience than a mother— since nature makes them partial — should o'erhear the speech , of vantage .
fare you well , my liege .
i ’ ll call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know .
thanks , dear my lord .
it hath the primal eldest curse upon propn , a brother ’ s murder .
so much for him .
that can not be , since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder : my crown , mine own ambition , and my queen .
may one be pardoned and retain th ' offense ?
in the corrupted currents of this world propn ’ s gilded hand may shove by justice , and oft ’ tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law .
but ’ tis not so above .
what can it not ?
yet what can it when one can not repent ?
o bosom black as death !
o limèd soul that , struggling to be free , propn more engaged !
help , angels .
make assay .
now might i do it pat .
now he is a - praying .
and now i ’ ll do propn .
and so he goes to propn .
and so am i revenged .— that would be scanned .
and am i then revenged
no .
words without thoughts never to propn go .
he will come straight .
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works .
speak to her , propn .
to whom do you speak this ?
avoid what is to come .
o propn , thou hast cleft my heart in twain .
good night — but go not to mine uncle ’ s bed .
assume a virtue if you have it not .
so , again , good night .
i must be cruel only to be kind .
thus bad begins and worse remains behind .
twere good you let him know , for who that ’ s but a queen , fair , sober , wise , would from a paddock , from a bat , a gib , such dear concernings hide ?
let it work , for ’ tis the sport to have the engineer propn with his own petard .
you must translate .
propn fit we understand them .
ah , my good lord , what have i seen tonight !
how does propn ?
o heavy deed !
alas , how shall this bloody deed be answered ?
but , like the owner of a foul disease , to keep it from divulging , let it feed even on the pith of life .
where is he gone ?
go seek him out , speak fair , and bring the body into the chapel .
safely stowed .
what have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
tell us where ’ tis , that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel .
believe what ?
but such officers do the king best service in the end .
i am glad of it .
yet must not we put the strong law on him .
without , my lord ; guarded , to know your pleasure .
bring him before us .
not where he eats , but where he is eaten .
that ’ s the end .
what dost you mean by this ?
therefore prepare thyself .
the bark is ready and the wind at help , propn ' associates tend , and everything is bent for propn .
propn , dear mother .
thy loving father , propn .
my mother .
do it , propn , for like the hectic in my blood he rages , and thou must cure me .
i will do propn , my lord .
go softly on .
they are of propn , sir .
what says propn ?
take thy fair hour , propn .
thou know ’ st ’ tis common .
ay , madam , it is common .
propn be wi ' you , sir .
go a little before .
what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed ?
a beast , no more .
i will not speak with her .
what would she have ?
where is the beauteous majesty of propn ?
nay , but , ophelia— pray you , mark .
how do you , pretty lady ?
propn be at your table .
conceit upon her father .
how long hath she been thus ?
we must be patient , but i can not choose but weep , to think they should lay him i ' th ' cold ground .
oh , this is the poison of deep grief .
propn propn divided from herself and her fair judgment , without the which we are pictures , or mere beasts .
propn , what noise is this ?
i pray you , give me leave .
do not fear our person .
conscience and grace , to the profoundest pit !
i dare damnation .
who shall stay you ?
my will , not all the world .
and for my means , i ’ ll husband them so well , they shall go far with little .
will you know them then ?
how now ?
what noise is that ?
tears seven times salt , burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
by propn , thy madness shall be paid by weight , till our scale turn the beam .
you must sing this nothing ’ s more than matter .
there ’ s rosemary , that ’ s for remembrance .
nay , it is .
do you see this , o propn ?
laertes , i must commune with your grief , or you deny me right .
let this be so .
so you shall .
seafaring men , sir .
let them come in .
let him bless thee too .
fare - well .
now must your conscience my acquaintance seal , and you must put me in your heart for friend , propn you have heard , and with a knowing ear , that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life .
it well appears .
letters , my lord , from propn .
sailors , my lord , they say .
i saw them not .
he received them of him that brought them .
how otherwise ? — will you be ruled by me ?
he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation .
why ask you this ?
and nothing is at a like goodness still .
but , good propn , will you do this , keep close within your chamber .
i will do propn .
therefore this project
be as ourself in propn .— propn , come .
come away .
one woe doth tread upon another ’ s heel , so fast they follow .— your sister propn drowned , propn .
alas , then she is drowned .
but yet it is our trick .
let ’ s follow , propn .
how much i had to do to calm his rage !
now fear i this will give it start again .
therefore let ’ s follow .
is she to be buried in christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation ?
the crowner hath sat on her and finds it christian burial .
how can that be , unless she drowned herself in her own defense ?
it must be propn , but hear you , propn propn give me leave .
but is this law ?
ay , marry , is propn .
crowner ’ s quest law .
come , my spade .
why , he had none .
marry , now i can tell .
has this fellow no feeling of his business ?
he sings at grave- making .
that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once .
it might , my lord .
ay , my lord .
mine ache to think on propn .
not a jot more , my lord .
i will speak to this fellow .— whose grave propn this , sirrah ?
you lie out on propn , sir , and therefore it is not yours .
propn for the dead , not for the quick .
therefore thou liest .
what man dost thou dig it for ?
what woman , then ?
the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe .— how long hast thou been a grave - maker ?
of all the days i ' the year , i came to propn that day that our last propn propn overcame propn .
ay , marry , why was he sent into propn ?
why , because he was mad .
why ?
propn not be seen in him there .
how came he mad ?
how “ strangely ” ?
faith , e'en with losing his wits .
why he more than another ?
let me see .
that he might not beteem the winds of propn visit her face too roughly .— propn and earth , must i remember ?
why , she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on , and yet , within a month— let me not think on propn .
within a month , propn yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes , she married .
it is not nor it can not come to good , but break , my heart , for i must hold my tongue .
hail to your lordship .
i am glad to see you well.— propn ?
or i do forget myself ?
propn , my good friend , i ’ ll change that name with you .
my good lord .
what ’ s that , my lord ?
dost thou think propn looked o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth ?
e'en so .
and smelt so ?
propn !
e'en so , my lord .
to what base uses we may return , propn .
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of propn till he find it stopping a bunghole ?
twere to consider too curiously , to consider so .
no , faith , not a jot .
propn propn , dead and turned to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , should patch a wall t ' expel the winter ’ s flaw !
but soft , but soft a while .
here comes the king , the queen , the courtiers — who is this they follow , and with such maimèd rites ?
this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand propn its own life .
couch we a while and mark .
what ceremony else ?
for charitable prayers propn , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her .
yet here she is allowed her virgin crants , her maiden strewments , and the bringing home of bell and burial .
must there no more be done ?
no more be done .
we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and such rest to her as to peace - parted souls .
lay her i ' th ' earth , and from her fair and unpolluted flesh propn violets spring !
i tell thee , churlish priest , a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling .
sweets to the sweet .
farewell !
oh , treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursèd head , whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of !
hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms .
hold off thy hand .
propn them asunder .
o my son , what theme ?
i loved propn .
forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum .
what wilt thou do for her ?
o , he is mad , propn .
for love of propn , forbear him .
swounds , show me what thou'lt do .
woo ’ t weep ?
woo ’ t fight ?
woo ’ t fast ?
woo ’ t tear thyself ?
i ’ ll do propn .
and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us , till our ground , singeing his pate against the burning zone , make ossa like a wart !
this is mere madness .
and thus a while the fit will work on him .
propn , as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclosed , his silence will sit drooping .
i loved you ever .
but it is no matter .
i pray thee , good propn , wait upon him .
who ’ s there ?
long live the king !
propn ?
he .
you come most carefully upon your hour .
propn now struck twelve .
get thee to bed , propn .
for this relief much thanks .
propn bitter cold , and i am sick at heart .
have you had quiet guard ?
not a mouse stirring .
well , good night .
if you do meet propn and propn , the rivals of my watch , bid them make haste .
i think i hear them .— stand , ho !
so much for this , sir .
now shall you see the other .
you do remember all the circumstance ?
remember it , my lord ?
propn , in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep .
methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes .
is ’ t possible ?
i beseech you .
wilt thou know propn ' effect of what i wrote ?
ay , good my lord .
i had my father ’ s signet in my purse , which was the model of that danish seal .
folded the writ up in form of th ' other , propn it , gave propn th ' impression , placed it safely , the changeling never known .
now , the next day was our sea fight , and what to this was sequent propn know ’ st already .
so propn and propn go to propn .
why , man , they did make love to this employment .
they are not near my conscience .
their defeat does by their own insinuation grow .
propn dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensèd points of mighty opposites .
why , what a king is this !
is propn not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm ?
and is propn not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil ?
it must be shortly known to him from propn what is the issue of the business there .
it will be short .
the interim ’ s mine .
i ’ ll court his favors .
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion .
peace .— who comes here ?
your lordship is right welcome back to propn .
i humbly thank you , sir .
sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , i should impart a thing to you from his propn .
i thank your lordship .
it is very hot .
it is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
exceedingly , my lord .
it is very sultry — as propn — i can not tell how .
my lord , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head .
propn , this is the matter— i beseech you , remember— propn , good my lord , for mine ease , in good faith .
propn , his definement suffers no perdition in you , though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th ' arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail .
a truant disposition , good my lord .
i would not hear your enemy say so , nor shall you do mine ear that violence , to make it truster of your own report against yourself .
i know you are no truant .
but what is your affair in propn ?
we ’ ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
my lord , i came to see your father ’ s funeral .
i pray thee , do not mock me , fellow student .
i think it was to see my mother ’ s wedding .
indeed , my lord , it followed hard upon .
the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables .
would i had met my dearest foe in propn or ever i had seen that day , propn .
my father — methinks i see my father .
where , my lord ?
in my mind ’ s eye , propn .
i saw him once .
he was a goodly king .
he was a man .
take him for all in all .
i shall not look upon his like again .
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
the concernancy , sir ?
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath ?
propn ?
i know you are not ignorant— i would you did , sir .
yet in faith , if you did , it would not much approve me .
well , sir ?
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is—
i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence , but to know a man well were to know himself .
i mean , sir , for his weapon .
rapier and dagger .
that ’ s two of his weapons .
but well .
the king , sir , hath wagered with him six barbary horses , against the which he has impawned , as i take it , six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns — as girdle , hangers , and so .
three of the carriages , in faith , are very dear to fancy , very responsive to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberal conceit .
what call you the carriages ?
the carriages , sir , are the hangers .
the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides .
i would it might be hangers till then .
but , on : six barbary horses against six french swords , their assigns , and three liberal - conceited carriages — that ’ s the french bet against the propn .
why is this “ impawned , ” as you call it ?
the king , sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him , he shall not exceed you three hits .
how if i answer “ no ” ?
if it please his propn , ’ tis the breathing time of day with me .
i commend my duty to your lordship .
yours , yours .
he does well to commend it himself .
there are no tongues else for ’ s turn .
he did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it .
he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with propn , or that you will take longer time .
i am constant to my purpose .
they follow the king ’ s pleasure .
if his fitness speaks , mine is ready , now or whensoever , provided i be so able as now .
the king and queen and all are coming down .
in happy time .
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to propn before you fall to play .
she well instructs me .
you will lose this wager , my lord .
i do not think so .
since he went into propn , i have been in continual practice .
i shall win at the odds .
but thou wouldst not think how ill all ’ s here about my heart .
but it is no matter .
i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .
not a whit .
we defy augury .
if it be not to come , it will be now .
since no man of aught he leaves knows , what is propn to leave betimes ?
let be .
come , propn , come , and take this hand from me .
but in my terms of honor i stand aloof , and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters , of known honor , i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored .
come , one for me .
i ’ ll be your foil , propn .
you mock me , sir .
no , by this hand .
very well , my lord .
your grace hath laid the odds o ' th ' weaker side .
i have seen you both .
but since he is better we have therefore odds .
ay , my good lord .
set me the stoups of wine upon that table .
if propn give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange , let all the battlements their ordnance fire !
the king shall drink to propn propn better breath , and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in propn ’ s crown have worn .
give me the cups .
come on , sir .
come , my lord .
one .
no .
judgment ?
a hit , a very palpable hit .
well , again .
stay , give me drink .— propn , this pearl is thine .
here ’ s to thy health .
give him the cup .
set it by a while .
come .
another hit .
what say you ?
a touch , a touch , i do confess propn .
our son shall win .
he ’ s fat , and scant of breath.— here , propn , take my napkin , rub thy brows .
the queen carouses to thy fortune , propn .
good madam .
propn , do not drink .
i will , my lord .
i pray you , pardon me .
i dare not drink yet , madam .
by and by .
come , let me wipe thy face .
i do not think propn .
come , for the third , propn .
you do but dally .
i pray you , pass with your best violence .
i am afeard you make a wanton of me .
say you so ?
come on .
have at you now !
part them !
they are incensed .
nay , come , again .
look to the queen there , ho !
they bleed on both sides .— how is it , my lord ?
how is propn , propn ?
why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , propn .
how does the queen ?
she swoons to see them bleed .
the drink , the drink !
i am poisoned .
o villainy !
ho , let the door be locked .
treachery !
seek it out .
it is here , propn .
propn , thou art slain .
no medicine in the world can do thee good .
in thee there is not half an hour of life .
the treacherous instrument is in thy hand , propn and envenomed .
the foul practice propn turned itself on me .
propn , here i lie , never to rise again .
propn mother propn poisoned .
i can no more .
the king , the king ’ s to blame .
the point envenomed propn , venom , to thy work .
my lord , i think i saw him yesternight .
saw who ?
the king my father ? !
season your admiration for a while with an attent ear , till i may deliver , upon the witness of these gentlemen , this marvel to you .
for propn ’ s love , let me hear .
two nights together had these gentlemen , propn and propn , on their watch , in the dead waste and middle of the night , been thus encountered : a figure like your father , propn at point exactly , cap - à - pie , appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them .
propn he walked by their oppressed and fear - surprisèd eyes within his truncheon ’ s length , whilst they , distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear , stand dumb and speak not to him .
i knew your father .
but where was this ?
treason !
treason !
o , yet defend me , friends .
i am but hurt .
here , thou incestuous , murderous , damnèd propn , drink off this potion .
is thy union here ?
follow my mother .
he is justly served .
it is a poison tempered by himself .
exchange forgiveness with me , noble propn .
mine and my father ’ s death come not upon thee , nor thine on me .
propn make thee free of it .
thou livest .
never believe it .
i am more an antique propn than a propn .
here ’ s yet some liquor left .
as thou'rt a man , give me the cup .
let go !
by propn , i ’ ll have propn .
o propn , propn , what a wounded name , things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity a while , and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story .
what warlike noise is this ?
propn propn , with conquest come from propn , to th ' ambassadors of propn gives this warlike volley .
o , i die , propn .
the potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit .
i can not live to hear the news from propn .
but i do prophesy the election lights on propn .
he has my dying voice .
o , o , o , propn
where is this sight ?
what is it ye would see ?
this quarry cries on havoc .
o proud death , what feast is toward in thine eternal cell , that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck ?
the sight is dismal , and our affairs from propn come too late .
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing , to tell him his commandment is fulfilled , that propn and propn are dead .
had it th ' ability of life to thank you .
for me , with sorrow i embrace my fortune .
let four captains propn propn like a soldier to the stage , for he was likely , had he been put on , to have proved most royally .
and , for his passage , the soldiers ' music and the rites of war speak loudly for him .
take up the bodies .
my lord , upon the platform where we watch .
did you not speak to it ?
my lord , i did , but answer made it none .
propn very strange .
as i do live , my honored lord , ’ tis true .
and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it .
indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me .
hold you the watch tonight ?
we do , my lord .
armed , say you ?
propn , my lord .
from top to toe ?
my lord , from head to foot .
then saw you not his face ?
oh yes , my lord .
he wore his beaver up .
pale or red ?
nay , very pale .
and fixed his eyes upon you ?
most constantly .
i would i had been there .
stayed it long ?
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
longer , longer .
not when i saw propn .
his beard was grizzled , no ?
it was , as i have seen it in his life , a sable silvered .
i will watch tonight .
perchance ' twill walk again .
i warrant it will .
if it assume my noble father ’ s person , i ’ ll speak to it , though propn itself should gape and bid me hold my peace .
i pray you all , if you have hitherto concealed this sight , let it be tenable in your silence still .
and whatsoever else shall hap tonight , give it an understanding , but no tongue .
i will requite your loves .
so fare you well .
upon the platform , ’ twixt eleven and twelve , i ’ ll visit you .
our duty to your honor .
your loves , as mine to you .
propn .
my father ’ s spirit in arms .
all is not well .
i doubt some foul play .
would the night were come !
till then sit still , my soul .
foul deeds will rise , though all the earth o'erwhelm them , to men ’ s eyes .
my necessaries are embarked .
propn .
and , sister , as the winds give benefit and convey is assistant , do not sleep , but let me hear from you .
do you doubt that ?
for propn and the trifling of his favor , hold it a fashion and a toy in blood , a violet in the youth of primy nature , propn , not permanent , sweet , not lasting , the perfume and suppliance of a minute .
no more .
no more but so ?
think it no more .
then weigh what loss your honor may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs , or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open to his unmastered importunity .
fear it , propn .
fear it , my dear sister , and keep you in the rear of your affection , out of the shot and danger of desire .
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth , contagious blastments are most imminent .
be wary , then .
best safety lies in fear .
youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart .
o , fear me not .
i stay too long .
but here my father comes .
yet here , propn ?
aboard , aboard , for shame !
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayed for .
there , my blessing with thee .
and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character .
give thy thoughts no tongue , nor any unproportioned thought his act .
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar .
beware of entrance to a quarrel , but being in , propn propn that th ' opposèd may beware of thee .
give every man thy ear but few thy voice .
take each man ’ s censure but reserve thy judgment .
propn .
your servants tend .
propn in my memory locked , and you yourself shall keep the key of it .
propn .
what is propn , propn , he hath said to you ?
so please you , something touching the propn propn .
if it be so as so propn put on me— and that in way of caution — i must tell you , you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behooves my daughter and your honor .
what is between you ?
give me up the truth .
he hath , my lord , of late made many tenders of his affection to me .
affection !
pooh , you speak like a green girl , unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
do you believe his “ tenders , ” as you call them ?
i do not know , my lord , what i should think .
marry , i ’ ll teach you .
think yourself a baby that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay , which are not sterling .
tender yourself more dearly , or — not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , running it thus — propn tender me a fool .
go to , go to .
and hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of propn .
ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
i do know , when the blood burns , how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows .
for propn propn , propn so much in him that he is young , and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you .
look to propn , i charge you .
come your ways .
i shall obey , my lord .
friends to this ground .
and liegemen to the propn .
give you good night .
o , farewell , honest soldier .
who hath relieved you ?
propn has my place .
give you good night .
say what , is propn there ?
a piece of him .
what , has this thing appeared again tonight ?
i have seen nothing .
propn says ’ tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him propn this dreaded sight twice seen of us .
therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night , that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it .
it is a nipping and an eager air .
what hour now ?
i think it lacks of twelve .
no , it is struck .
indeed ?
i heard it not .
it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wo nt to walk .
what does this mean , my lord ?
is it a custom ?
ay , marry , is propn .
but to my mind , though i am native here and to the manner born , it is a custom more honored in the breach than the observance .
this heavy - headed revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations .
they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase propn our addition .
and indeed it takes from our achievements , though performed at height , the pith and marrow of our attribute .
the dram of evil propn all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal .
look , my lord , it comes !
angels and ministers of grace defend us !
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned , bring with thee airs from propn or blasts from hell , be thy intents wicked or charitable , thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee .
i ’ ll call thee “ propn , ” “ propn , ” “ propn , ” “ royal propn . ” o , answer me !
let me not burst in ignorance , but tell why thy canonized bones , hearsed in death , have burst their cerements ; why the sepulcher ,
wherein we saw thee quietly interred , propn oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again .
wherefore ?
it beckons you to go away with it , as if it some impartment did desire to you alone .
look , with what courteous action it waves you to a more removèd ground .
but do not go with it .
no , by no means .
do not , my lord .
why , what should be the fear ?
i do not set my life in a pin ’ s fee , and for my soul — what can it do to that , being a thing immortal as itself ?
it waves me forth again .
i ’ ll follow it .
and there assume some other horrible form , which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness ?
think of it .
it waves me still .
you shall not go , my lord .
hold off your hands .
be ruled .
you shall not go .
still am i called .— propn me , gentlemen .
by propn , i ’ ll make a ghost of him that lets me .
he waxes desperate with imagination .
let ’ s follow .
propn not fit thus to obey him .
nay , let ’ s follow him .
where wilt thou lead me ?
speak , i ’ ll go no further .
mark me .
i will .
my hour is almost come when i to sulfurous and tormenting flames must render up myself .
alas , poor ghost !
speak .
i am bound to hear .
so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear .
what ?
i am thy father ’ s spirit , doomed for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires , till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away .
but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house , i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul , freeze thy young blood ,
make thy two eyes , like stars , start from their spheres , propn knotted and combinèd locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end , like quills upon the fearful porpentine .
but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood .
list , list , o , list !
if thou didst ever thy dear father love— o propn !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
murder ?
murder most foul , as in the best it is .
but this most foul , strange and unnatural .
haste me to know propn , that i , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love , may sweep to my revenge .
my uncle ?
o propn , what a falling off was there !
from me , whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage , and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine .
propn let me be .
thus was i , sleeping , by a brother ’ s hand of life , of crown , of queen at once dispatched , cut off even in the blossoms of my sin ,
oh , horrible , oh , horrible , most horrible !
if thou hast nature in thee , bear it not .
let not the royal bed of propn be a couch for luxury and damnèd incest .
leave her to propn and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her .
fare thee well at once .
the glowworm shows the matin to be near , and ' gins to pale his uneffectual fire .
propn , adieu , adieu .
remember me .
o all you host of propn !
o earth !
what else ?
and shall i couple hell ?
oh , fie !
hold , hold , my heart , and you , my sinews , grow not instant old , but bear me stiffly up .
remember thee !
ay , thou poor ghost , whiles memory holds a seat in this distracted globe .
remember thee !
yea , from the table of my memory i ’ ll wipe away all trivial fond records , all saws of books , all forms , all pressures past that youth and observation copied there , and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain , unmixed with baser matter .
yes , by propn !
o most pernicious woman !
o villain , villain , smiling , damnèd villain !
my tables ! —meet it is i set it down that one may smile , and smile , and be a villain .
at least i ’ m sure it may be so in propn .
remember me . ” i have sworn propn .
my lord , my lord !
propn propn propn secure him !
so be it .
illo , ho , ho , my lord !
propn , ho , ho , boy .
come , bird , come .
how is propn , my noble lord ?
what news , my lord ?
oh , wonderful !
good my lord , tell it .
not i , my lord , by propn .
nor i , my lord .
how say you , then ?
but you ’ ll be secret ?
ay , by propn , my lord .
sit down a while and let us once again assail your ears , that are so fortified against our story , what we have two nights seen .
well , sit we down , and let us hear propn speak of this .
last night of all , when yond same star that ’ s westward from the pole had made his course t ' illume that part of heaven where now it burns , propn and myself , the bell then beating one— peace , break thee off .
look where it comes again !
in the same figure like the king that ’ s dead .
most like .
it harrows me with fear and wonder .
it would be spoke to .
question it , propn .
by propn , i charge thee , speak .
there ’ s ne'er a villain dwelling in all propn but he ’ s an arrant knave .
there needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave to tell us this .
why , right , you are in the right .
and so , without more circumstance at all , i hold it fit that we shake hands and part .
you , as your business and desire shall point you— for every man has business and desire , such as it is — and for my own poor part , look you , i ’ ll go pray .
these are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
there ’ s no offense , my lord .
yes , by propn propn , but there is , propn , and much offense too .
touching this vision here , it is an honest ghost , that let me tell you .
for your desire to know what is between us , o'ermaster propn as you may .
and now , good friends , as you are friends , scholars and soldiers , give me one poor request .
what is propn , my lord ?
we will .
never make known what you have seen tonight .
my lord , we will not .
nay , but swear propn .
in faith , my lord , not i .
nor i , my lord , in faith .
upon my sword .
we have sworn , my lord , already .
indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
consent to swear .
never to speak of this that you have seen .
swear by my sword .
come hither , gentlemen , and lay your hands again upon my sword .
swear by my sword never to speak of this that you have heard .
well said , old mole !
a worthy pioneer !
once more remove , good friends .
o day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
there are more things in propn and earth , propn , than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
this not to do , so grace and mercy at your most need help you , propn .
nay , come , let ’ s go together .
give him this money and these notes , propn .
i will , my lord .
you shall do marvelous wisely , good propn , before you visit him , to make inquire of his behavior .
my lord , i did intend it .
marry , well said , very well said .
take you , as ’ twere , some distant knowledge of him , as thus : “ i know his father and his friends , and , in part , him . ” do you mark this , propn ?
ay , very well , my lord .
and in part him , but , ” you may say , “ not well .
addicted so and so.— ” and there put on him what forgeries you please .
but , sir , such wanton , wild , and usual slips
ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , propn , drabbing — you may go so far .
my lord , that would dishonor him !
faith , no , as you may season it in the charge .
but , my good lord— propn should you do this ?
ay , my lord .
i would know that .
very good , my lord .
and then , sir , does he this , he does— what was i about to say ?
by the mass , i was about to say something .
where did i leave ?
i saw him yesterday ” —or “ t ' other day , ” or then , or then , with such or such— “ and , as you say , there was he gaming , there o'ertook in ’ s rouse , there falling out at tennis , ” or , perchance , “ i saw him enter such a house of sale ” — your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth .
you have me , have you not ?
my lord , i have .
propn be wi ' you .
fare you well .
good my lord .
i shall , my lord .
and let him ply his music .
well , my lord .
propn .
with what , i ' th ' name of propn ?
mad for thy love ?
what said he ?
long stayed he so .
at last , a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down , he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being .
come , go with me .
i will go seek the king .
this is the very ecstasy of love , whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under propn that does afflict our natures .
i am sorry .
that hath made him mad .
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him .
i feared he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee .
but beshrew my jealousy !
by propn , it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion .
come , go we to the king .
welcome , dear propn and propn .
moreover that we much did long to see you , the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending .
something have you heard of propn ’ s “ propn call it since nor th ' exterior nor the inward man propn that it was .
what it should be , more than his father ’ s death , that thus hath put him so much from th ' understanding of himself , i can not dream of .
both your majesties propn , by the sovereign power you have of us , put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty .
but we both obey and here give up ourselves , in the full bent , to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded .
thanks , propn and gentle propn .
thanks , guildenstern and gentle propn .
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changèd son .
go , some of you , and bring these gentlemen where propn is .
heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him !
ay , amen !
th ' ambassadors from propn , my good lord , are joyfully returned .
thou still hast been the father of good news .
have i , my lord ?
i assure my good liege , i hold my duty as i hold my soul , both to my propn and to my gracious king .
it is offended .
see , it stalks away .
stay !
i charge thee , speak !
how now , horatio ?
you tremble and look pale .
is not this something more than fantasy ?
what think you on propn ?
before my propn , i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes .
is it not like the king ?
as thou art to thyself .
such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious propn combated .
so frowned he once when , in an angry parle , he smote the sledded propn on the ice .
propn strange .
and i do think — or else this brain of mine propn not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do — that i have found the very cause of propn ’ s lunacy .
oh , speak of that .
that do i long to hear .
give first admittance to th ' ambassadors .
my news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
thyself do grace to them , and bring them in .
he tells me , my dear propn , he hath found the head and source of all your son ’ s distemper .
i doubt it is no other but the main : his father ’ s death and our o'erhasty marriage .
well , we shall sift him .— welcome , my good friends !
say , propn , what from our brother propn ?
whereat grieved— that so his sickness , age , and impotence was falsely borne in hand — sends out arrests on propn , which he , in brief , obeys , receives rebuke from propn , and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th ' assay of arms against your majesty .
propn old propn , overcome with joy ,
gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers , so levied as before , against the propn , with an entreaty , herein further shown , that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise , on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down .
meantime we thank you for your well - took labor .
go to your rest .
at night we ’ ll feast together .
most welcome home !
this business is well ended .
my liege and madam , to expostulate what majesty should be , what duty is , why day is day , night night , and time is time , were nothing but to waste night , day , and time .
therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , i will be brief : your noble son is mad .
mad call i it , for , to define true madness , what is propn but to be nothing else but mad ?
but let that go .
thus it remains , and the remainder thus .
i have a daughter — have while she is mine— who in her duty and obedience , mark , propn given me this .
good madam , stay a while .
i will be faithful .
o dear propn , i am ill at these numbers .
i have not art to reckon my groans , but that i love thee best , oh , most best , believe it .
propn .
propn . ” this in obedience hath my daughter shown me , and more above , hath his solicitings , as they fell out by time , by means , and place , all given to mine ear .
but how hath she received his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a man faithful and honorable .
i would fain prove so .
what might you think ?
no , i went round to work , and my young mistress thus i did bespeak : “ propn propn is a prince out of thy star .
it may be , very like .
propn there been such a time — i would fain know that— that i have positively said , “ ' propn so , ” when it proved otherwise ?
not that i know .
how may we try it further ?
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby .
so he does indeed .
at such a time i ’ ll loose my daughter to him .
away , i do beseech you , both away .
i ’ ll board him presently .
o , give me leave .
how does my good propn propn ?
well , propn .
do you know me , my lord ?
the town is beseeched , and the trumpet call us to the breach , and we talk and , be propn , do nothing , ’ tis shame for us all .
so propn sa ' me , ’ tis shame to stand still .
by the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber , ay ’ ll de gud service , or i ’ ll lig i ' th ' grund for it , ay , or go to death .
propn propn , i think , look you , under your correction , there is not many of your nation— of my nation ?
what ish my nation ?
propn a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal .
what ish my nation ?
who talks of my nation ?
look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , propn propn , peradventure i shall think you do not use me with that affability as , in discretion , you ought to use me , look you , being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities .
i do not know you so good a man as myself .
so propn save me , i will cut off your head .
gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .
ah , that ’ s a foul fault .
the town sounds a parley .
propn propn , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , i will be so bold as to tell you i know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .
how yet resolves the governor of the town ?
this is the latest parle we will admit .
therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or , like to men proud of destruction , propn us to our worst .
for , as i am a soldier , a name that in my thoughts becomes me best , if i begin the batt'ry once again , i will not leave the half - achieved propn propn in her ashes she lie burièd .
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up , and the fleshed soldier , rough and hard of heart , in liberty of bloody hand , shall range with conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants .
what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career ?
we may as bootless spend our vain command upon th ' enragèd soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the propn to come ashore .
what say you ?
will you yield and this avoid or , guilty in defense , be thus destroyed ?
our expectation hath this day an end .
the propn , whom of succors we entreated , returns us that his powers are yet not ready to raise so great a siege .
therefore , great propn , we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy .
open your gates .
come , uncle propn , go you and enter propn .
there remain and fortify it strongly ' gainst the propn .
tonight in propn will we be your guest ; tomorrow for the march are we addressed .
it must be so , for miracles are ceased , and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected .
doth his propn propn to it or no ?
d'elbow . ” “ d'elbow , ” “ propn nick , ” “ propn nick . ” “ propn chin . ” “ propn sin . ”
propn certain he hath passed the river propn .
an if he be not fought withal , my lord , let us not live in propn .
let us quit all and give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
normans , but bastard propn , propn bastards !
unfought withal , but i will sell my dukedom to buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm in that nook - shotten isle of propn .
is not their climate foggy , raw , and dull , on whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale , killing their fruit with frowns ?
and shall our quick blood , spirited with wine , propn frosty ?
where is propn the herald ?
speed him hence .
let him greet propn with our sharp defiance .
up , princes , and , with spirit of honor edged more sharper than your swords , hie to the field : propn propn , high propn of propn ; you dukes of propn , propn , and of propn , propn , propn , propn , and propn ; propn propn , propn , propn , propn , propn , propn , and propn , propn , propn , propn , and propn ; high dukes , great princes , barons , lords , and knights , for your great seats now quit you of great shames .
bar propn propn , that sweeps through our land with pennons painted in the blood of propn .
therefore , propn propn , haste on propn and let him say to propn that we send to know what willing ransom he will give .
propn propn , you shall stay with us in propn .
not so , i do beseech your propn .
be patient , for you shall remain with us .
now forth , propn propn and princes all , and quickly bring us word of propn ’ s fall .
is the duke of propn safe ?
he is called propn propn .
i know him not .
here is the man .
captain , i thee beseech to do me favors .
the duke of propn doth love thee well .
ay , i praise propn , and i have merited some love at his hands .
propn is an excellent moral .
a damnèd death !
propn propn , i do partly understand your meaning .
die and be damned , and it is well .
why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal .
i ’ ll assure you , he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer ’ s day .
trick up with new - tuned oaths ; and what a beard of the general ’ s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale - washed wits is wonderful to be thought on .
but you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvelously mistook .
if i find a hole in his coat , i will tell him my mind .
how now , propn , propn thou from the bridge ?
ay , so please your propn .
the duke of propn has very gallantly maintained the pridge .
the propn is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages .
marry , th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of propn is master of the pridge .
i can tell your propn , the duke is a prave man .
what men have you lost , fluellen ?
the perdition of th ' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great .
marry , for my part , i think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one propn , if your propn know the man .
we would have all such offenders so cut off , and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the propn upbraided or abused in disdainful language ; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner .
you know me by my habit .
well then , i know thee .
what shall i know of thee ?
my master ’ s mind .
unfold it .
thus says my king : “ say thou to propn of propn , though we seemed dead , we did but sleep .
advantage is a better soldier than rashness .
tell him we could have rebuked him at propn , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe .
now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial .
with good acceptance of his majesty— save that there was not time enough to hear , as i perceived his propn would fain have done , the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms , and generally to the crown and seat of propn , derived from propn , his great - grandfather .
what was th ' impediment that broke this off ?
the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience .
and the hour , i think , is come to give him hearing .
is it four o'clock ?
it is .
then go we in to know his embassy , which i could with a ready guess declare before the propn speak a word of it .
bid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which , in weight to reanswer , his pettiness would bow under .
for our losses , his exchequer is too poor ; for th ' effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number ; and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction .
to this , add defiance , and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced . ” so far my king and master ; so much my office .
what is thy name ?
i know thy quality .
propn .
thou dost thy office fairly .
turn thee back , and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to propn without impeachment , for , to say the sooth , propn ’ tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage , my people are with sickness much enfeebled , my numbers lessened , and those few i have almost no better than so many propn , who when they were in health , i tell thee , propn , i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen .
yet , forgive me , propn , that i do brag thus .
go therefore , tell thy master : here i am .
i shall deliver so .
thanks to your propn .
i hope they will not come upon us now .
we are in propn ’ s hand , brother , not in theirs .
propn to the bridge .
it now draws toward night .
propn , i have the best armor of the world .
would it were day !
you have an excellent armor , but let my horse have his due .
it is the best horse of propn .
will it never be morning ?
my lord of propn , and my propn high propn , you talk of horse and armor ?
you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
what a long night is this !
i will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns .
he bounds from the earth , as if his entrails were hairs , le cheval volant , the propn , qui a les narines de feu .
the earth sings when he touches it .
the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of propn .
he ’ s of the color of the nutmeg .
and of the heat of the ginger .
it is a beast for propn .
he is indeed a horse , and all other jades you may call beasts .
indeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .
it is the prince of palfreys .
his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch , and his countenance enforces homage .
no more , cousin .
nay , the man hath no wit that can not , from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb , vary deserved praise on my palfrey .
it is a theme as fluent as the sea .
turn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all .
propn a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign ’ s sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown , to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .
i once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus : “ propn of nature— ” i have heard a sonnet begin so to one ’ s mistress .
then did they imitate that which i composed to my courser , for my horse is my mistress .
your mistress bears well .
so perhaps did yours .
mine was not bridled .
oh , then belike she was old and gentle , and you rode , like a kern of propn , your french hose off and in your straight strossers .
you have good judgment in horsemanship .
be warned by me , then : they that ride so , and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs .
i had rather have my horse to my mistress .
i had as lief have my mistress a jade .
i tell thee , constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow to my mistress .
propn propn est retourné à son propre vomissement , et la truie lavée au bourbier . ” propn mak ’ st use of anything .
yet do i not use my horse for my mistress , or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .
my propn propn , the armor that i saw in your tent tonight , are those stars or suns upon it ?
stars , my lord .
some of them will fall tomorrow , i hope .
and yet my sky shall not want .
that may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and ’ twere more honor some were away .
ev'n as your horse bears your praises — who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted .
would i were able to load him with his desert !
will it never be day ?
i will not say so , for fear i should be faced out of my way .
propn midnight .
i ’ ll go arm myself .
the propn longs for morning .
he longs to eat the propn .
swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
he is simply the most active gentleman of propn .
doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
he never did harm that i heard of .
nor will do none tomorrow .
he will keep that good name still .
i know him to be valiant .
i was told that by one that knows him better than you .
what ’ s he ?
marry , he told me so himself ; and he said he cared not who knew it .
he needs not .
it is no hidden virtue in him .
propn a hooded valor , and when it appears , it will bate .
ill will never said well .
have at the very eye of that proverb with “ a pox of the devil . ” you are the better at proverbs , by how much “ a fool ’ s bolt is soon shot . ” you have shot over .
propn not the first time you were overshot .
my propn high propn , the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
who hath measured the ground ?
the propn propn .
alas , poor propn of propn !
he longs not for the dawning as we do .
what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of propn to mope with his fat - brained followers so far out of his knowledge .
if the propn had any apprehension , they would run away .
that they lack , for if their heads had any intellectual armor , they could never wear such heavy head - pieces .
that island of propn breeds very valiant creatures .
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .
foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
you may as well say , that ’ s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .
just , just ; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives .
and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
ay , but these propn are shrewdly out of beef .
then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight .
now is it time to arm .
come , shall we about it ?
it is now two o'clock .
but , let me see , by ten we shall have each a hundred propn .
now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark propn the wide vessel of the universe .
oh , now , who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band
where is my gracious lord of propn ?
not here in presence .
send for him , good uncle .
shall we call in th ' ambassador , my liege ?
not yet , my cousin .
we would be resolved , before we hear him , of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and propn .
propn and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it .
sure we thank you .
my learnèd lord , we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law propn that they have in propn or should or should not bar us in our claim .
and propn forbid , my dear and faithful lord , that you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading , or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate , whose right suits not in native colors with the truth ; for propn doth know how many now in health propn drop their blood in approbation
let him cry , “ praise and glory on his head ! ” for forth he goes and visits all his host , propn them good morrow with a modest smile , and calls them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him , nor doth he dedicate one jot of color unto the weary and all - watchèd night , but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty , that every wretch , pining and pale before , beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks .
propn , ’ tis true that we are in great danger .
the greater therefore should our courage be .
good morrow , brother propn .
propn almighty , there is some soul of goodness in things evil , would men observingly distill it out .
for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers , which is both healthful and good husbandry .
besides , they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all , admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end .
thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself .
good morrow , old propn propn propn .
a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of propn .
so the spirit is eased .
and when the mind is quickened , out of doubt , the organs , though defunct and dead before , break up their drowsy grave and newly move , with casted slough and fresh legerity .
lend me thy cloak , propn propn .
we shall , my liege .
shall i attend your grace ?
no , my good knight .
go with my brothers to my lords of propn .
i and my bosom must debate awhile , and then i would no other company .
the propn in propn bless thee , noble propn !
a friend .
discuss unto me : art thou officer or art thou base , common , and popular ?
i am a gentleman of a company .
propn thou the puissant pike ?
even so .
what are you ?
as good a gentleman as the emperor .
then you are a better than the king .
the king propn a bawcock , and a heart of gold , a lad of life , an imp of fame , of parents good , of fist most valiant .
i kiss his dirty shoe , and from heartstring i love the lovely bully .
what is thy name ?
propn le propn .
propn propn ?
a cornish name .
art thou of cornish crew ?
no , i am a propn .
propn thou fluellen ?
yes .
tell him i ’ ll knock his leek about his pate upon propn propn ’ s day .
do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .
art thou his friend ?
and his kinsman too .
the i thank you .
propn be with you .
my name is propn called .
it sorts well with your fierceness .
propn propn .
it is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept .
if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of propn the propn , you shall find , i warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in propn ’ s camp .
i warrant you , you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise .
why , the enemy is loud .
you hear him all night .
if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , in your own conscience , now ?
i will speak lower .
i pray you and beseech you that you will .
though it appear a little out of fashion , there is much care and valor in this propn .
brother propn propn , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?
we see yonder the beginning of the day , but i think we shall never see the end of it .— who goes there ?
a friend .
under what captain serve you ?
under propn propn propn .
a good old commander and a most kind gentleman .
i pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
even as men wracked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .
he hath not told his thought to the king ?
the violet smells to him as it doth to me .
his ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man , and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing .
therefore , when he sees reason of fears as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are .
yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .
he may show what outward courage he will , but i believe , as cold a night as ’ tis , he could wish himself in propn up to the neck ; and so i would he were , and i by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here .
by my troth , i will speak my conscience of the king .
i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is .
i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men ’ s minds .
methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king ’ s company , his cause being just and his quarrel honorable .
that ’ s more than we know .
if his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us .
but if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , “ we died at such a place , ” some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .
i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle , for how can they charitably dispose of anything , when blood is their argument ?
the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant , for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services .
besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrament of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers .
now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from propn .
where they feared the death , they have borne life away ; and where they would be safe , they perish .
then , if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited .
every subject ’ s duty is the king propn , but every subject ’ s soul is his own .
therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed : wash every mote out of his conscience .
and , dying so , death is to him advantage ; or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained .
propn certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head .
the king is not to answer it .
i do not desire he should answer for me , and yet i determine to fight lustily for him .
i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
if i live to see it , i will never trust his word after .
you pay him then .
that ’ s a perilous shot out of an elder gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch .
you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock ’ s feather .
you ’ ll “ never trust his word after . ” come , ’ tis a foolish saying .
your reproof is something too round .
i should be angry with you if the time were convenient .
let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
i embrace it .
how shall i know thee again ?
give me any gage of thine , and i will wear it in my bonnet .
then , if ever thou propn acknowledge it , i will make it my quarrel .
there .
this will i also wear in my cap .
if ever thou come to me and say , after tomorrow , “ this is my glove , ” by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear .
if ever i live to see it , i will challenge it .
thou dar ’ st as well be hanged .
well , i will do it , though i take thee in the king ’ s company .
keep thy word .
fare thee well .
indeed , the propn may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us , for they bear them on their shoulders .
but it is no english treason to cut french crowns , and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper .
of what your reverence shall incite us to .
therefore take heed how you impawn our person , how you awake our sleeping sword of war .
under this conjuration , speak , my lord , for we will hear , note , and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism .
then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers that owe yourselves , your lives , and services to this imperial throne .
upon the king !
let us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children , and our sins lay on the king !
we must bear all .
o hard condition , twin - born with greatness , subject to the breath of every fool , whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing .
what infinite heart ’ s ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy ?
and what have kings that privates have not too , propn ceremony , save general ceremony ?
and what art thou , thou idol ceremony ?
what kind of god art thou , that propn more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?
what are thy comings in ?
o ceremony , show me but thy worth !
what is thy soul of adoration ?
art thou aught else but place , degree , and form , creating awe and fear in other men , wherein thou art less happy , being feared , than they in fearing ?
what drink ’ st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , but poisoned flattery ?
oh , be sick , great greatness , and bid thy ceremony give thee cure !
think ’ st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation ?
will it give place to flexure and low bending ?
propn thou , when thou command ’ st the beggar ’ s knee , command the health of it ?
no , thou proud dream , that play ’ st so subtly with a king propn repose .
and , but for ceremony , such a wretch , winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , had the forehand and vantage of a king .
my lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , seek through your camp to find you .
good old knight , collect them all together at my tent .
i ’ ll be before thee .
i shall do ’ t , my lord .
o propn of battles , steel my soldiers ' hearts .
possess them not with fear .
take from them now the sense of reck'ning ere th ' opposèd numbers propn their hearts from them .
not today , o propn , oh , not today , think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown .
i propn ’ s body have interrèd anew , and on it have bestowed more contrite tears than from it issued forcèd drops of blood .
five hundred poor i have in yearly pay , who twice a day their withered hands hold up toward propn to pardon blood .
and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for propn ’ s soul .
more will i do— though all that i can do is nothing worth , since that my penitence comes after all , imploring pardon .
my liege .
my brother propn ’ s voice .— ay , i know thy errand .
i will go with thee .
the day , my friends , and all things stay for me .
the sun doth gild our armor .
up , my lords .
now , my propn constable ?
propn how our steeds for present service neigh .
ha !
what , will you have them weep our horses ' blood ?
how shall we then behold their natural tears ?
the propn are embattled , you french peers .
to horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse .
what ’ s to say ?
then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount , for our approach shall so much dare the field that propn shall couch down in fear and yield .
why do you stay so long , my lords of propn ?
yond island carrions , desperate of their bones , ill - favoredly become the morning field .
big propn seems bankrupt in their beggared host and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps .
they have said their prayers , and they stay for death .
shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits , and give their fasting horses provender , and after fight with them ?
on , to the field !
i will the banner from a trumpet take and use it for my haste .
come , come away .
the sun is high , and we outwear the day .
where is the king ?
the king himself is rode to view their battle .
of fighting men they have full threescore thousand .
there ’ s five to one .
besides , they all are fresh .
propn ’ s arm strike with us !
propn a fearful odds .
propn be wi ' you , princes all .
i ’ ll to my charge .
propn , good propn , and good luck go with thee .
propn , kind lord .
fight valiantly today .
and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it , for thou art framed of the firm truth of valor .
he is as full of valor as of kindness , propn in both .
oh , that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in propn that do no work today .
what ’ s he that wishes so ?
my cousin propn ?
no , my fair cousin .
if we are marked to die , we are enough to do our country loss ; and if to live , the fewer men , the greater share of honor .
propn ’ s will , i pray thee wish not one man more .
by propn , i am not covetous for gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost ; it yearns me not if men my garments wear ; such outward things dwell not in my desires .
but if it be a sin to covet honor , i am the most offending soul alive .
no , faith , my coz , wish not a man from propn .
propn ’ s peace , i would not lose so great an honor as one man more , methinks , would share from me , for the best hope i have .
oh , do not wish one more !
his passport shall be made , and crowns for convoy put into his purse .
we would not die in that man ’ s company that fears his fellowship to die with us .
he that shall see this day , and live old age , will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say , “ tomorrow is propn propn . ” then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars , and say , “ these wounds i had on propn propn day . ”
all things are ready if our minds be so .
perish the man whose mind is backward now !
thou dost not wish more help from propn , coz ?
propn be with you all .
tucket once more i come to know of thee , propn propn , if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound , before thy most assurèd overthrow .
for certainly thou art so near the gulf propn needs must be englutted .
besides , in mercy , the constable desires thee thou wilt mind propn followers of repentance , that their souls may make a peaceful and a sweet retire from off these fields where , wretches , their poor bodies must lie and fester .
who hath sent thee now ?
the constable of propn .
i pray thee , bear my former answer back .
bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
the man that once did sell the lion ’ s skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him .
a many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves , upon the which , i trust , shall witness live in brass of this day ’ s work .
and those that leave their valiant bones in propn , dying like men though buried in your dunghills , they shall be famed ; for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honors reeking up to propn , leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime ,
besides , their writers say , propn propn , which deposèd propn , did , as heir general , being descended of propn , which was daughter to propn propn , make claim and title to the crown of propn .
hugh propn also , who usurped the crown of propn the duke of propn , sole heir male of the true line and stock of propn the propn , to find his title with some shows of truth , though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught , conveyed himself as th ' heir to th ' propn propn , propn to propn , who was the son to propn the propn , and propn the son of propn the propn .
also propn propn the propn , who was sole heir to the usurper propn , could not keep quiet in his conscience , wearing the crown of propn , till satisfied that fair propn propn , his grandmother , was lineal of the propn propn , propn to propn the foresaid duke of propn , by the which marriage the line of propn the propn was reunited to the crown of propn .
so that , as clear as is the summer ’ s sun , propn propn ’ s title and propn propn ’ s claim , propn propn his satisfaction , all appear to hold in right and title of the female .
let me speak proudly : tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day ; our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field .
there ’ s not a piece of feather in our host— good argument , i hope , we will not fly— and time hath worn us into slovenry .
if they do this , as , if propn please , they shall , my ransom then will soon be levied .
propn , save thou thy labor .
come thou no more for ransom , gentle herald .
they shall have none , i swear , but these my joints , which , if they have , as i will leave 'em them , shall yield them little .
tell the constable .
i shall , propn propn .
and so fare thee well .
thou never shalt hear herald anymore .
i fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom .
my lord , most humbly on my knee i beg the leading of the vaward .
take it , brave propn .
now , soldiers , march away , and how propn pleasest , propn , dispose the day .
yield , cur .
he says his name is propn propn .
propn propn .
what are his words ?
he prays you to save his life .
he is a gentleman of a good house , and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns .
tell him my fury shall abate , and i the crowns will take .
expound unto me , boy .
he gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks , and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall'n into the hands of one , as he thinks , the most brave , valorous , and thrice- worthy seigneur of propn .
as i suck blood , i will some mercy show .
follow me .
i did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart .
i must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp .
the propn might have a good prey of us if he knew of it , for there is none to guard it but boys .
propn and everlasting shame propn mocking in our plumes .
do not run away .
why , all our ranks are broke .
o perdurable shame !
let ’ s stab ourselves .
be these the wretches that we played at dice for ?
is this the king we sent to for his ransom ?
shame , and eternal shame , nothing but shame !
let us die .
and he that will not follow propn now , let him go hence , and with his cap in hand like a base pander hold the chamber door , propn by a slave , no gentler than my dog , his fairest daughter is contaminate .
disorder , that hath spoiled us , friend us now .
let us on heaps go offer up our lives .
we are enough yet living in the field to smother up the propn in our throngs , if any order might be thought upon .
the devil take order now !
i ’ ll to the throng .
let life be short , else shame will be too long .
yet keep the french the field .
the duke of propn commends him to your propn .
lives he , good uncle ?
thrice within this hour i saw him down , thrice up again and fighting .
from helmet to the spur , all blood he was .
in which array , brave soldier , doth he lie , larding the plain , and by his bloody side , yoke - fellow to his honor - owing wounds , the noble earl of propn also lies .
propn first died , and propn , all haggled over , comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped and takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes that bloodily did yawn upon his face .
and cries aloud , “ tarry , my cousin propn .
my soul shall thine keep company to propn .
tarry , sweet soul , for mine ; then fly abreast , as in this glorious and well - foughten field we kept together in our chivalry . ” upon these words i came and cheered him up .
the propn have reinforced their scattered men .
then every soldier kill his prisoners .
give the word through .
so do the kings of propn unto this day , propn they would hold up this salic law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles propn from you and your progenitors .
may i with right and conscience make this claim ?
the sin upon my head , dread sovereign , for in the propn of propn is it writ : “ when the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter . ” gracious lord , stand for your own , unwind your bloody flag , look back into your mighty ancestors .
go , my dread lord , to your great - grandsire ’ s tomb , from whom you claim .
invoke his warlike spirit and your great - uncle propn , propn the propn propn , who on the french ground played a tragedy , making defeat on the full power of propn propn his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion ’ s whelp propn in blood of french nobility .
o noble propn , that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of propn and let another half stand laughing by , all out of work and cold for action !
awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats .
you are their heir , you sit upon their throne , the blood and courage that renownèd them runs in your veins ; and my thrice - puissant liege is in the very propn - morn of his youth , propn for exploits and mighty enterprises .
kill the poys and the luggage !
propn expressly against the law of arms .
propn as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offert , in your conscience now , is it not ?
propn certain there ’ s not a boy left alive , and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha ' done this slaughter .
besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king ’ s tent , wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner ’ s throat .
oh , ’ tis a gallant king !
ay , he was porn at propn , propn propn .
why , i pray you , is not “ pig ” great ?
the pig , or the great , or the mighty , or the huge , or the magnanimous are all one reckonings , save the phrase is a little variations .
i think propn the propn was born in propn .
his father was called propn of propn , as i take it .
i think it is in propn where propn is porn .
i tell you , captain , if you look in the maps of the ' orld , i warrant you shall find , in the comparisons between propn and propn , that the situations , look you , is both alike .
there is a river in propn , and there is also , moreover , a river at propn .
it is called propn at propn , but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river .
but ’ tis all one ; ’ tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both .
if you mark propn ’ s life well , propn of propn ’ s life is come after it indifferent well , for there is figures in all things .
propn , propn knows and you know , in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also being a little intoxicates in his prains , did , in his ales and his angers , look you , kill his best friend , propn .
it is not well done , mark you now , to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished .
i speak but in the figures and comparisons of it .
propn propn propn .
that is he .
i ’ ll tell you , there is good men porn at propn .
here comes his propn .
i was not angry since i came to propn until this instant .
take a trumpet , propn .
ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill .
if they will fight with us , bid them come down , or void the field .
they do offend our sight .
if they ’ ll do neither , we will come to them and make them skirr away as swift as stones propn from the old assyrian slings .
go and tell them so .
here comes the herald of the propn , my liege .
his eyes are humbler than they used to be .
propn thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom ?
propn thou again for ransom ?
no , great king .
i come to thee for charitable license , that we may wander o'er this bloody field to book our dead and then to bury them ; to sort our nobles from our common men , for many of our princes — woe the propn lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood .
so do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs in blood of princes , and the wounded steeds propn fetlock deep in gore , and with wild rage propn out their armèd heels at their dead masters , killing them twice .
oh , give us leave , great king , to view the field in safety and dispose of their dead bodies .
the day is yours .
praised be propn , and not our strength , for it !
what is this castle called that stands hard by ?
they call it propn .
then call we this the field of propn , propn on the day of propn propn .
your grandfather of famous memory , an ’ t please your propn , and your great - uncle propn the propn propn of propn , as i have read in the chronicles , fought a most prave pattle here in propn .
they did , propn .
your propn says very true .
if your propn is remembered of it , the propn did good service in a garden where leeks did grow , wearing leeks in their propn caps , which , your propn know , to this hour is an honorable badge of the service .
and i do believe your propn takes no scorn to wear the leek upon propn propn ’ s day .
i wear it for a memorable honor , for i am propn , you know , good countryman .
thanks , good my countryman .
by propn , i am your propn ’ s countryman , i care not who know it .
i will confess it to all the ' orld .
i need not to be ashamed of your propn , praised be propn , so long as your propn is an honest man .
propn keep me so .— our heralds go with him .
bring me just notice of the numbers dead on both our parts .
soldier , you must come to the king .
soldier , why wear ’ st thou that glove in thy cap ?
propn please your propn , ’ tis the gage of one that i should fight withal , if he be alive .
an propn ?
he is a craven and a villain else , an propn please your propn , in my conscience .
it may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort , quite from the answer of his degree .
though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is , as propn and propn himself , it is necessary , look your grace , that he keep his vow and his oath .
if he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a propn propn as ever his black shoe trod upon propn ’ s ground and his earth , in my conscience , la .
then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meet ’ st the fellow .
so i will , my liege , as i live .
who serv ’ st thou under ?
under propn propn , my liege .
gower is a good captain , and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars .
call him hither to me , soldier .
i will , my liege .
here , propn , wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap .
your grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects .
propn thou propn ?
he is my dear friend , an please you .
pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .
i will fetch him .
my propn of propn and my brother propn , propn propn closely at the heels .
the glove which i have given him for a favor may haply purchase him a box o ' th ' ear .
i by bargain should wear it myself .
follow , and see there be no harm between them .
go you with me , uncle of propn .
i warrant it is to knight you , captain .
propn ’ s will and his pleasure , captain , i beseech you now , come apace to the king .
propn , know you this glove ?
know the glove !
i know the glove is a glove .
i know this , and thus i challenge it .
propn , an arrant traitor as any ’ s in the universal world , or in propn , or in propn !
do you think i ’ ll be forsworn ?
stand away , propn propn .
i will give treason his payment into plows , i warrant you .
i am no traitor .
he ’ s a friend of the propn propn propn .
my propn of propn , here is , praised be propn for it , a most contagious treason come to light , look you , as you shall desire in a summer ’ s day .
here is his propn .
my liege , here is a villain and a traitor , that , look your grace , has struck the glove which your propn is take out of the helmet of propn .
my liege , this was my glove ; here is the fellow of it .
i met this man with my glove in his cap , and i have been as good as my word .
your propn , hear now , saving your propn ’ s manhood , what an arrant , rascally , beggarly , lousy knave it is .
i hope your propn is pear me testimony and witness , and will avouchment that this is the glove of propn that your propn is give me , in your conscience now .
propn i indeed thou promised ’ st to strike , and thou hast given me most bitter terms .
they know your grace hath cause and means and might ; so hath your propn .
never king of propn had nobles richer , and more loyal subjects , whose hearts have left their bodies here in propn and lie pavilioned in the fields of propn .
oh , let their bodies follow , my dear liege , with blood and sword and fire to win your right , in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors .
we do not mean the coursing snatchers only , but fear the main intendment of the propn , who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us .
an please your propn , let his neck answer for it , if there is any martial law in the world .
how canst thou make me satisfaction ?
it was ourself thou didst abuse .
your propn came not like yourself .
you appeared to me but as a common man .
and what your propn suffered under that shape , i beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine , for , had you been as i took you for , i made no offense .
therefore , i beseech your propn pardon me .
i will none of your money .
it is with a good will .
i can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes .
come , wherefore should you be so pashful ?
your shoes is not so good .
propn a good silling , i warrant you , or i will change it .
now , propn , are the dead numbered ?
here is the number of the slaughtered propn .
what prisoners of good sort are taken , uncle ?
this note doth tell me of ten thousand propn that in the field lie slain .
of princes in this number and nobles bearing banners , there lie dead one hundred twenty - six .
added to these , of knights , esquires , and gallant gentlemen , eight thousand and four hundred , of the which , five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights .
so that in these ten thousand they have lost , there are but sixteen hundred mercenaries .
the rest are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , and gentlemen of blood and quality .
of lusty earls : propn and propn , propn and propn , propn and propn , propn and propn .
where is the number of our english dead ?
when , without stratagem , but in plain shock and even play of battle , was ever known so great and little loss on one part and on th ' other ?
take it , propn , for it is none but thine .
propn wonderful .
yes , captain , but with this acknowledgement : that propn fought for us .
yes , my conscience , he did us great good .
do we all holy rites .
propn to those that have not read the story that i may prompt them ; and of such as have , i humbly pray them to admit th ' excuse of time , of numbers , and due course of things , which can not in their huge and proper life be here presented .
so let him land , and solemnly see him set on to propn .
so swift a pace hath thought that even now you may imagine him upon propn , where that his lords desire him to have borne his bruisèd helmet and his bended sword before him through the city .
he forbids it , being free from vainness and self - glorious pride , giving full trophy , signal , and ostent propn from himself , to propn .
but now behold , in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought , how propn doth pour out her citizens .
the propn and all his brethren in best sort , like to the senators of th ' antique propn , with the plebeians swarming at their heels , go forth and fetch their conquering propn propn as , by a lower but loving likelihood ,
then brook abridgment , and your eyes advance after your thoughts , straight back again to propn .
propn propn ’ s day is past .
there is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things .
it was in place where i could not breed no contention with him , but i will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till i see him once again , and then i will tell him a little piece of my desires .
why , here he comes , swelling like a turkey - cock .
ha , art thou bedlam ?
hence .
i am qualmish at the smell of leek .
i peseech you heartily , scurvy , lousy knave , at my desires , and my requests , and my petitions , to eat , look you , this leek .
because , look you , you do not love it , nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it , i would desire you to eat it .
not for propn and all his goats .
there is one goat for you .
propn propn , thou shalt die .
you say very true , scald knave , when propn propn will is .
i will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals .
come , there is sauce for it .
propn , captain .
you have astonished him .
i say i will make him eat some part of my leek , or i will peat his pate four days .— bite , i pray you .
it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .
must i bite ?
yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question , too , and ambiguities .
by this leek , i will most horribly revenge .
will you have some more sauce to your leek ?
there is not enough leek to swear by .
quiet thy cudgel .
thou dost see i eat .
much good do you , scald knave , heartily .
nay , pray you throw none away .
the skin is good for your broken coxcomb .
when you take occasions to see leeks hereafter , i pray you , mock at 'em , that is all .
good .
ay , leeks is good .
hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .
me , a groat ?
if i owe you anything , i will pay you in cudgels .
you shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels .
propn be wi ' you and keep you and heal your pate .
all hell shall stir for this .
go , go .
you are a counterfeit cowardly knave .
will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor , and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words ?
i have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice .
you thought because he could not speak propn in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an english cudgel .
fare you well .
propn propn play the huswife with me now ?
news have i that my propn is dead i ' th ' spital of a malady of propn , and there my rendezvous is quite cut off .
propn i do wax , and from my weary limbs propn is cudgeled .
well , bawd i ’ ll turn , and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand .
to propn will i steal , and there i ’ ll steal .
and patches will i get unto these cudgeled scars , and swear i got them in the propn wars .
but there ’ s a saying very old and true : “ if that you will propn win , then with propn first begin . ” for once the eagle propn being in prey , to her unguarded nest the weasel propn comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs , playing the mouse in absence of the cat , to ’ tame and havoc more than she can eat .
it follows , then , the cat must stay at home .
yet that is but a crushed necessity , since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves .
while that the armèd hand doth fight abroad , propn ' advisèd head defends itself at home .
right joyous are we to behold your face , most worthy brother propn .
so are you , princes propn , every one .
the venom of such looks , we fairly hope , have lost their quality , and that this day shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .
to cry “ amen ” to that , thus we appear .
you english princes all , i do salute you .
my duty to you both , on equal love , great kings of propn and propn .
that i have labored with all my wits , my pains , and strong endeavors , to bring your most imperial propn propn this bar and royal interview , your mightiness on both parts best can witness .
alas , she hath from propn too long been chased , and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps , corrupting in its own fertility .
her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , propn , dies .
her hedges , even - pleached , like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , put forth disordered twigs .
her fallow leas the darnel , hemlock , and rank fumitory propn root upon , while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery .
the even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover , wanting the scythe , withal uncorrected , rank , conceives by idleness , and nothing teems but hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs , losing both beauty and utility .
and as our vineyards , fallows , meads , and hedges , propn in their natures , grow to wildness , even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost , or do not learn for want of time , the sciences that should become our country , but grow like savages , as soldiers will
that nothing do but meditate on blood , to swearing and stern looks , diffused attire , and everything that seems unnatural .
if , propn of propn , you would the peace , whose want gives growth to th ' imperfections which you have cited , you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands , whose tenors and particular effects you have , enscheduled briefly , in your hands .
the king hath heard them , to the which as yet there is no answer made .
well then , the peace which you before so urged propn in his answer .
i have but with a cursitory eye o'erglanced the articles .
propn your grace to appoint some of your council presently to sit with us once more with better heed to resurvey them , we will suddenly pass our accept and peremptory answer .
and we ’ ll consign thereto .— will you , fair sister , go with the princes or stay here with us ?
our gracious brother , i will go with them .
haply a woman ’ s voice may do some good , when articles too nicely urged be stood on .
yet leave our cousin propn here with us .
she is our capital demand , comprised within the forerank of our articles .
she hath good leave .
propn propn , and most fair , will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady ’ s ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart ?
your propn shall mock at me .
i can not speak your propn .
o fair propn , if you will love me soundly with your french heart , i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your propn tongue .
do you like me , propn ?
an angel is like you , propn , and you are like an angel .
i said so , dear propn ; and i must not blush to affirm it .
the princess is the better propn .— i ' faith , propn , my wooing is fit for thy understanding .
i am glad thou canst speak no better propn , for if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown .
i know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say , “ i love you . ” then if you urge me farther than to say , “ do you , in faith ? ” i wear out my suit .
give me your answer , i ' faith , do ; and so clap hands and a bargain .
how say you , lady ?
for the one , i have neither words nor measure ; and for the other , i have no strength in measure , yet a reasonable measure in strength .
if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , under the correction of bragging be it spoken , i should quickly leap into a wife .
if thou canst love a fellow of this temper , propn , whose face is not worth sunburning , that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook .
i speak to thee plain soldier .
if thou canst love me for this , take me .
if not , to say to thee that i shall die is true , but for thy love , by the propn , no .
yet i love thee too .
and while thou liv ’ st , dear propn , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places .
for these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rhyme themselves into ladies ' favors , they do always reason themselves out again .
if thou would have such a one , take me .
and what propn thou then to my love ?
speak , my fair , and fairly , i pray thee .
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of propn ?
no , it is not possible you should love the enemy of propn , propn .
but , in loving me , you should love the friend of propn , for i love propn so well that i will not part with a village of it .
i will have it all mine .
and , propn , when propn is mine and i am yours , then yours is propn and you are mine .
i can not tell wat is dat .
no , propn ?
can any of your neighbors tell , propn ?
i ’ ll ask them .
but , good propn , mock me mercifully , the rather , gentle princess , because i love thee cruelly .
shall we not ?
what propn thou , my fair flower de luce ?
i do not know dat .
no , ’ tis hereafter to know , but now to promise .
do but now promise , propn , you will endeavor for your french part of such a boy ; and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor .
by mine honor , in true propn , i love thee , propn .
by which honor i dare not swear thou lovest me , yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost , notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage .
now , beshrew my father ’ s ambition !
but , in faith , propn , the elder i wax , the better i shall appear .
my comfort is that old age , that ill layer - up of beauty , can do no more spoil upon my face .
thou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst , and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better .
and therefore tell me , most fair propn , will you have me ?
put off your maiden blushes , avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress , take me by the hand , and say “ propn of propn , i am thine , ” which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal , but i will tell
thee aloud “ propn is thine , propn is thine , propn is thine , and propn propn is thine , ” who , though i speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows .
come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy propn broken .
therefore , queen of all , propn , break thy mind to me in broken propn .
wilt thou have me ?
den it sall also content me .
upon that i kiss your hand , and i call you my queen .
then i will kiss your lips , propn .
propn my interpreter , what says she ?
propn it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of propn — i can not tell propn is to kiss .
your it is not a fashion for the maids in propn to kiss before they are married , would she say ?
o propn , nice customs curtsy to great kings .
dear propn , you and i can not be confined within the weak list of a country ’ s fashion .
we are the makers of manners , propn , and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults , as i will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss .
therefore , patiently and yielding .
propn save your propn .
my royal cousin , teach you our princess propn ?
i would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly i love her , and that is good propn .
is she not apt ?
our tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth , so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , i can not so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness .
i this infer : that many things , having full reference to one consent , may work contrariously , as many arrows loosèd several ways come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , as many lines close in the dial ’ s center , so may a thousand actions , once afoot , end in one purpose , and be all well borne without defeat .
pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that .
if you would conjure in her , you must make a circle ; if conjure up propn in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind .
can you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self ?
it were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
they are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer .
and so i shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
as love is , my lord , before it loves .
it is so .
shall propn be my wife ?
so please you .
i am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her .
so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
we have consented to all terms of reason .
is propn so , my lords of propn ?
the king hath granted every article , his daughter first , and , in sequel , all , according to their firm proposed natures .
only he hath not yet subscribèd this : where your propn demands that the king of propn , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your highness in this form and with this addition , in propn : nor this i have not , brother , so denied but your request shall make me let it pass .
i pray you , then , in love and dear alliance , let that one article rank with the rest , and thereupon give me your daughter .
amen .
now welcome , propn , and bear me witness all that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen .
propn , the best maker of all marriages , combine your hearts in one , your realms in one .
propn speak this “ amen ” !
amen .
prepare we for our marriage ; on which day , my propn of propn , we ’ ll take your oath , and all the peers ' , for surety of our leagues .
then shall i swear to propn , and you to me , and may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be .
thus far with rough and all - unable pen our bending author hath pursued the story , in little room confining mighty men , mangling by starts the full course of their glory .
propn the propn , in infant bands crowned king of propn and propn , did this king succeed , whose state so many had the managing that they lost propn and made his propn bleed , which oft our stage hath shown .
and for their sake , in your fair minds let this acceptance take .
if we , with thrice such powers left at home , can not defend our own doors from the dog , let us be worried , and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy .
call in the messengers sent from the propn .
now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin propn , for we hear your greeting is from him , not from the king .
may propn please your propn to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge , or shall we sparingly show you far off the propn ’ s meaning and our embassy ?
propn out our imperfections with your thoughts .
into a thousand parts divide one man , and make imaginary puissance .
think , when we talk of horses , that you see them printing their proud hoofs i ' th ' receiving earth , for ’ tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings , carry them here and there , jumping o'er times ,
we are no tyrant , but a christian king , unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fettered in our prisons .
therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness tell us the propn ’ s mind .
you can not revel into dukedoms there .
he therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , this tun of treasure , and , in lieu of this , desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you .
this the propn speaks .
what treasure , uncle ?
tennis balls , my liege .
we are glad the propn is so pleasant with us .
his present and your pains we thank you for .
when we have matched our rackets to these balls , we will in propn , by propn ’ s grace , play a set propn strike his father ’ s crown into the hazard .
and we understand him well , how he comes o'er us with our wilder days , not measuring what use we made of them .
we never valued this poor seat of propn and therefore , living hence , did give ourself to barbarous license , as ’ tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home .
so get you hence in peace .
and tell the propn his jest will savor but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it .
this was a merry message .
we hope to make the sender blush at it .
therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour that may give furth'rance to our expedition ; for we have now no thought in us but propn , save those to propn , that run before our business .
therefore let every man now task his thought , that this fair action may on foot be brought .
now all the youth of propn are on fire , and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies .
propn he take ship for propn , and in propn .
there is the playhouse now , there must you sit , and thence to propn shall we convey you safe and bring you back , charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass ; for , if we may , we ’ ll not offend one stomach with our play .
but , till the king come forth , and not till then , unto propn do we shift our scene .
well met , propn propn .
good morrow , propn propn .
what , are propn propn and you friends yet ?
for my part , i care not .
i will bestow a breakfast to make you friends ; and we ’ ll be all three sworn brothers to propn .
let propn be so , good propn propn .
that is my rest ; that is the rendezvous of it .
i can not tell .
things must be as they may .
men may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time , and some say knives have edges .
there must be conclusions .
well , i can not tell .
here comes propn propn and his wife .
now , by this hand , i swear , i scorn the term , nor shall my propn keep lodgers .
oh , well - a - day , propn !
pish !
pish for thee , propn dog , thou prick - eared cur of propn !
good propn propn , show thy valor and put up your sword .
will you shog off ?
i am not propn ; you can not conjure me .
i have an humor to knock you indifferently well .
if you grow foul with me , propn , i will scour you with my rapier , as i may , in fair terms .
o braggart vile and damnèd furious wight , the grave doth gape , and doting death is near .
therefore exhale .
hear me , hear me what i say : he that strikes the first stroke , i ’ ll run him up to the hilts , as i am a soldier .
an oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate .
thy spirits are most tall .
by my troth , he ’ ll yield the crow a pudding one of these days .
the king has killed his heart .
good husband , come home presently .
come , shall i make you two friends ?
let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on !
you ’ ll pay me the eight shillings i won of you at betting ?
propn is the slave that pays .
that now i will have — that ’ s the humor of it .
as manhood shall compound .
push home .
by this sword , he that makes the first thrust , i ’ ll kill him .
by this sword , i will .
propn ” is an oath , and oaths must have their course .
prithee , put up .
in cash , most justly paid .
well , then , that ’ s the humor of propn .
as ever you come of women , come in quickly to propn propn .
ah , poor heart , he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold .
sweet men , come to him .
turning th ' accomplishment of many years into an hour - glass ; for the which supply , admit me chorus to this history ; who , prologue - like , your humble patience pray gently to hear , kindly to judge our play .
nym , thou hast spoke the right .
he passes some humors and careers .
they shall be apprehended by and by .
how smooth and even they do bear themselves , as if allegiance in their bosoms sat propn with faith and constant loyalty .
the king hath note of all that they intend , by interception which they dream not of .
now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .
my propn of propn , and my kind propn of propn , and you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts .
think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of propn , doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them ?
no doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .
i doubt not that , since we are well - persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours , nor leave not one behind that doth not wish propn and conquest to attend on us .
never was monarch better feared and loved than is your propn .
there ’ s not , i think , a subject that sits in heart - grief and uneasiness under the sweet shade of your government .
true .
those that were your father ’ s enemies have steeped their galls in honey , and do serve you with hearts create of duty and of zeal .
we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness .
we judge no less .— propn of propn , enlarge the man committed yesterday that railed against our person .
that ’ s mercy , but too much security .
oh , let us yet be merciful .
and now to our french causes .
who are the late commissioners ?
i one , my lord .
your propn bade me ask for it today .
so did you me , my liege .
and i , my royal sovereign .
i do confess my fault , and do submit me to your propn ' mercy .
to which we all appeal .
the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed .
propn so strange that , though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .
treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke - devils sworn to either propn purpose , working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them .
all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches , colors , and with forms being fetched from glist'ring semblances of piety .
but he that tempered thee bade thee stand up , gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason , unless to dub thee with the name of traitor .
if that same demon that hath gulled thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world , he might return to vasty propn back and tell the legions “ i can never win a soul so easy as that propn propn . ” oh , how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance !
why , so didst thou .
why , so didst thou .
come they of noble family ?
why , so didst thou .
seem they religious ?
why , so didst thou .
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem .
and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full - fraught man and best endued with some suspicion .
i will weep for thee , for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man .— their faults are open .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of propn , propn of propn .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of propn , propn propn of propn .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of propn propn , knight , of propn .
our purposes propn justly hath discovered , and i repent my fault more than my death , which i beseech your highness to forgive , although my body pay the price of it .
for me , the gold of propn did not seduce , although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended ; but propn be thankèd for prevention , which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice , beseeching propn and you to pardon me .
never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy o'er myself , prevented from a damnèd enterprise .
my fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .
propn quit you in his mercy .
touching our person , seek we no revenge , but we our kingdom ’ s safety must so tender , whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws we do deliver you .
get you therefore hence , poor miserable wretches , to your death , the taste whereof propn of his mercy give you patience to endure , and true repentance of all your dear offences .— bear them hence .
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war , since propn so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings .
we doubt not now but every rub is smoothèd on our way .
then forth , dear countrymen .
no king of propn if not king of propn .
for propn , he is dead , and we must earn therefore .
he ’ s in propn ’ s bosom , if ever man went to propn ’ s bosom .
i hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet .
they say he cried out of sack .
ay , that he did .
and of women .
nay , that he did not .
a could never abide carnation .
twas a color he never liked .
he said once the devil would have him about women .
he did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the propn of propn .
do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon propn ’ s nose , and he said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
shall we shog ?
the propn will be gone from propn .
look to my chattels and my movables .
therefore , propn , clear thy crystals .— yoke - fellows in arms , let us to propn , like horse - leeches , my boys , to suck , to suck , the very blood to suck .
my lord , i ’ ll tell you that self bill is urged which in th ' eleventh year of the last king ’ s reign was like , and had indeed against us passed but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question .
but how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?
it must be thought on .
if it pass against us , we lose the better half of our possession , for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the propn would they strip from us , being valued thus : “ as much as would maintain , to the propn ’ s honor , full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand and two hundred good esquires ; and , to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil , a hundred almshouses right well supplied ; and to the coffers of the propn besides , a thousand pounds by th ' year . ” thus runs the bill .
this would drink deep .
but what prevention ?
the king is full of grace and fair regard .
and a true lover of the holy propn .
and that ’ s but unwholesome food , they say .
touch her soft mouth , and march .
propn , hostess .
let housewifery appear .
keep close , i thee command .
propn .
propn .
therefore the propn of propn and of propn , of propn and of propn , shall make forth , and you , propn propn , with all swift dispatch , to line and new - repair our towns of war with men of courage and with means defendant .
for propn his approaches makes as fierce as waters to the sucking of a gulf .
and let us do it with no show of fear , no , with no more than if we heard that propn were busied with a propn morris - dance .
for , my good liege , she is so idly kinged , her scepter so fantastically borne by a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , that fear attends her not .
oh peace , propn propn !
you are too much mistaken in this king .
question your grace the late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy , how well supplied with noble counselors , how modest in exception , and withal how terrible in constant resolution , and you shall find his vanities forespent were but the outside of the propn propn , covering discretion with a coat of folly , as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots that shall first spring and be most delicate .
well , ’ tis not so , my propn high propn .
but though we think it so , it is no matter .
in cases of defense ’ tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems .
up in the air , crowned with the golden sun , saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him propn the work of nature and deface the patterns that by propn and by french fathers had twenty years been made .
this is a stem of that victorious stock , and let us fear the native mightiness and fate of him .
ambassadors from propn propn of propn propn crave admittance to your propn .
we ’ ll give them present audience .
go , and bring them .
good my sovereign , take up the propn short , and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head .
self - love , my liege , is not so vile a sin as self - neglecting .
from our brother propn ?
or else what follows ?
bloody constraint , for if you hide the crown even in your hearts , there will he rake for it .
for us , we will consider of this further .
tomorrow shall you bear our full intent back to our brother propn .
for the propn , i stand here for him .
what to him from propn ?
scorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt , and anything that may not misbecome the mighty sender , doth he prize you at .
thus says my king : an if your father ’ s propn do not , in grant of all demands at large , sweeten the bitter mock you sent his propn , he ’ ll call you to so hot an answer of it that caves and womby vaultages of propn propn chide your trespass and return your mock in second accent of his ordinance .
to that end , as matching to his youth and vanity , i did present him with the propn balls .
he ’ ll make your propn propn shake for it , were it the mistress court of mighty propn .
and be assured you ’ ll find a difference , as we his subjects have in wonder found , between the promise of his greener days and these he masters now .
tomorrow shall you know our mind at full .
dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king come here himself to question our delay , for he is footed in this land already .
you shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions .
a night is but small breath and little pause to answer matters of this consequence .
thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought .
play with your fancies and in them behold , upon the hempen tackle , shipboys climbing .
hear the shrill whistle , which doth order give to sounds confused .
behold the threaden sails , borne with th ' invisible and creeping wind , draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea , breasting the lofty surge .
oh , do but think you stand upon the rivage and behold a city on th ' inconstant billows dancing , for so appears this fleet majestical holding due course to propn .
follow , follow !
work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege .
behold the ordnance on their carriages , with fatal mouths gaping on girded propn .
suppose th ' propn from the propn comes back , propn propn that the king doth offer him
propn his daughter and with her , to dowry , some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .
still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind .
once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more , or close the wall up with our english dead !
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide , hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height .
on , on , you noblest propn , whose blood is fet from fathers of war - proof , fathers that , like so many alexanders , have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument .
propn not your mothers .
now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you .
and you , good yeoman , whose limbs were made in propn , show us here the mettle of your pasture .
let us swear that you are worth your breeding , which i doubt not ,
we are blessèd in the change .
list his discourse of war , and you shall hear a fearful battle rendered you in music .
follow your spirit , and upon this charge propn “ propn for propn , propn , and propn propn ! ”
on , on , on , on , on !
to the breach , to the breach !
pray thee , corporal , stay .
the plainsong ” is most just , for humors do abound .
would i were in an alehouse in propn !
i would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .
and i .
up to the breach , you dogs !
propn , you cullions !
be merciful , great duke , to men of mold .
good bawcock , ' bate thy rage .
use lenity , sweet chuck .
these be good humors .
your propn wins bad humors .
as young as i am , i have observed these three swashers .
i am boy to them all three , but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me .
they will steal anything and call it purchase .
they would have me as familiar with men ’ s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers , which makes much against my manhood , if i should take from another ’ s pocket to put into mine , for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs .
i must leave them and seek some better service .
their villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore i must cast it up .
to the mines ?
the concavities of it is not sufficient , for , look you , th ' athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines .
by propn , i think he will plow up all if there is not better directions .
the duke of propn , to whom the order of the siege is given , is altogether directed by an propn , a very valiant gentleman , i ' faith .
it is propn propn , is it not ?
i think it be .
by propn , he is an ass , as in the world .
i will verify as much in his beard .
he has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars , look you , of the roman disciplines , than is a puppy dog .
here he comes , and the propn captain , propn propn , with him .
propn propn is a marvelous falorous gentleman , that is certain , and of great expedition and knowledge in th ' aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions .
by propn , he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the propn .
i say gudday , propn propn .
godden to your worship , good propn propn .
how now , propn propn , have you quit the mines ?
have the pioneers given o'er ?
by propn , la , ’ tish ill done .
by my hand i swear , and my father ’ s soul , the work ish ill done .
it ish give over .
i would have blowed up the town , so propn save me , la , in an hour .
oh , ’ tish ill done , ’ tish ill done , by my hand , ’ tish ill done .
propn propn , i beseech you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the roman wars ?
in the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication , partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline , that is the point .
what enterprise , propn ?
fare you well .
look how he makes to propn .
mark him .
propn , be sudden , for we fear prevention propn , what shall be done ?
if this be known , propn or propn never shall turn back , for i will slay myself .
cassius , be constant .
propn knows his time .
where is propn propn ?
let him go and presently prefer his suit to propn .
he is addressed .
press near and second him .
propn , you are the first that rears your hand .
are we all ready ?
most high , most mighty , and most puissant propn , propn propn throws before thy seat an humble heart— i must prevent thee , propn .
these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children .
what , propn ?
i could be well moved if i were as you .
if i could pray to move , prayers would move me .
but i am constant as the northern star , of whose true - fixed and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament .
the skies are painted with unnumbered sparks .
so in the world .
and that i am he let me a little show it even in this : that i was constant propn should be banished , and constant do remain to keep him so .
hence !
wilt thou lift up propn ?
doth not propn bootless kneel ?
speak , hands , for me !
propn !
freedom !
tyranny is dead !
run hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets .
some to the common pulpits , and cry out , “ propn , freedom , and enfranchisement ! ” people and senators , be not affrighted .
fly not .
go to the pulpit , propn .
and propn too .
where ’ s propn ?
stand fast together , lest some friend of propn propn should chance— talk not of standing .— propn , good cheer .
there is no harm intended to your person , nor to no propn else .
so tell them , propn .
and leave us , propn , lest that the people , rushing on us , should do your age some mischief .
do so .
and let no man abide this deed but we the doers .
where is propn ?
fled to his house amazed .
men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run as it were doomsday .
why , he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death .
propn , propn , stoop , and let us bathe our hands in propn ’ s blood up to the elbows , and besmear our swords .
then walk we forth , even to the marketplace , and waving our red weapons o'er our heads let ’ s all cry , “ peace , freedom , and liberty ! ” propn , then , and wash .
who calls ?
bid every noise be still .
peace yet again .
who is it in the press that calls on me ?
i hear a tongue , shriller than all the music , cry “ caesar ! ” —speak .
propn is turned to hear .
beware the ides of propn .
what man is that ?
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of propn .
set him before me .
let me see his face .
propn , come from the throng .
look upon propn .
what sayst thou to me now ?
speak once again .
beware the ides of propn .
he is a dreamer .
let us leave him .
pass !
will you go see the order of the course ?
how many times shall propn bleed in sport , that now on propn ’ s basis lies along no worthier than the dust !
ay , every man away .
propn shall lead , and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of propn .
soft !
who comes here ?
a friend of propn propn .
propn master is a wise and valiant roman .
i never thought him worse .
tell him , so please him come unto this place , he shall be satisfied and , by my honor , propn untouched .
i know that we shall have him well to friend .
but here comes propn .— welcome , propn propn .
o mighty propn !
dost thou lie so low ?
are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , propn to this little measure ?
fare thee well .
i know not , gentlemen , what you intend , who else must be let blood , who else is rank .
if i myself , there is no hour so fit as propn ’ s death ’ s hour , nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords , made rich with the most noble blood of all this world .
i do beseech ye , if you bear me hard , now , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke , propn your pleasure .
live a thousand years , i shall not find myself so apt to die .
no place will please me so , no mean of death , as here by propn , and by you cut off , the choice and master spirits of this age .
o antony , beg not your death of us .
they are pitiful .
and pity to the general wrong of propn as fire drives out fire , so pity pity— propn done this deed on propn .
for your part , to you our swords have leaden points , propn propn .
our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers ' temper do receive you in with all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
your voice shall be as strong as any man ’ s in the disposing of new dignities .
only be patient till we have appeased the multitude , beside themselves with fear , and then we will deliver you the cause , why i , that did love propn when i struck him , have thus proceeded .
i doubt not of your wisdom .
let each man render me his bloody hand .
propn propn propn me , propn propn .
therefore i took your hands , but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on propn .
friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope : that you shall give me reasons why and wherein propn was dangerous .
our reasons are so full of good regard that were you , propn , the son of propn , you should be satisfied .
you shall , propn propn .
propn , a word with you .
it shall advantage more than do us wrong .
propn propn , here , take you propn ’ s body .
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us , but speak all good you can devise of propn , and say you do propn by our permission .
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going , after my speech is ended .
be it so .
i do desire no more .
prepare the body then , and follow us .
thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever livèd in the tide of times .
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
over thy wounds now do i prophesy— which , like dumb mouths , do ope their propn lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue— a curse shall light upon the limbs of men .
domestic fury and fierce civil strife propn cumber all the parts of propn .
i do , propn propn .
propn did write for him to come to propn .
he did receive his letters and is coming .
passion , i see , is catching , for mine eyes , seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , began to water .
is thy master coming ?
he lies tonight within seven leagues of propn .
post back with speed , and tell him what hath chanced .
thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace .
lend me your hand .
we will be satisfied !
let us be satisfied !
then follow me and give me audience , friends .
cassius , go you into the other street and part the numbers .
those that will hear me speak , let 'em stay here .
those that will follow propn , go with him , and public reasons shall be renderèd of propn ’ s death .
i will hear propn speak .
i will hear propn and compare their reasons when severally we hear them renderèd .
the noble propn is ascended .
be patient till the last .
romans , countrymen , and lovers !
hear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear .
believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe .
censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge .
if there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of propn propn , to him i say that propn ' love to propn was no less than his .
if then that friend demand why propn rose against propn , this is my answer : not that i loved propn less , but that i loved propn more .
had you rather propn were living and die all slaves , than that propn were dead , to live all free men ?
as propn loved me , i weep for him .
as he was fortunate , i rejoice at it .
as he was valiant , i honor him .
but , as he was ambitious , i slew him .
there is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his valor , and death for his ambition .
who is here so base that would be a bondman ?
if any , speak — for him have i offended .
who is here so rude that would not be a propn ?
if any , speak — for him have i offended .
who is here so vile that will not love his country ?
if any , speak — for him have i offended .
i pause for a reply .
none , propn , none .
then none have i offended .
i have done no more to propn than you shall do to propn .
the question of his death is enrolled in the propn .
his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .
here comes his body , mourned by propn propn , who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying — a place in the commonwealth — as which of you shall not ?
live , propn !
live , live !
bring him with triumph home unto his house !
i am not gamesome .
i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in propn .
let me not hinder , propn , your desires .
i ’ ll leave you .
cassius , be not deceived .
tell me , good propn , can you see your face ?
let him be propn !
propn ’ s better parts shall be crowned in propn !
we ’ ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
my countrymen— peace , silence !
propn speaks .
peace , ho !
good countrymen , let me depart alone .
i do entreat you , not a man depart , save i alone , till propn have spoke .
let him go up into the public chair .
we ’ ll hear him .— noble propn , go up .
for propn ' sake , i am beholding to you .
what does he say of propn ?
he says for propn ' sake he finds himself beholding to us all .
twere best he speak no harm of propn here .
this propn was a tyrant .
nay , that ’ s certain .
we are blest that propn is rid of him .
peace !
let us hear what propn can say .
you gentle propn peace , ho !
let us hear him .
friends , propn , countrymen , lend me your ears .
i come to bury propn , not to praise him .
the evil that men do lives after them ; the good is oft interrèd with their bones .
so let it be with propn .
the noble propn propn told you propn was ambitious .
if it were so , it was a grievous fault , and grievously hath propn answered it .
here , under leave of propn and the rest— for propn is an honorable man ; so are they all , all honorable men— come i to speak in propn ’ s funeral .
he was my friend , faithful and just to me .
but propn says he was ambitious , and propn is an honorable man .
he hath brought many captives home to propn whose ransoms did the general coffers fill .
did this in propn seem ambitious ?
when that the poor have cried , propn hath wept .
propn should be made of sterner stuff .
yet propn says he was ambitious , and propn is an honorable man .
you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown , which he did thrice refuse .
was this ambition ?
i speak not to disprove what propn spoke , but here i am to speak what i do know .
if thou consider rightly of the matter , propn has had great wrong .
has he , masters ?
he would not take the crown .
therefore ’ tis certain he was not ambitious .
if it be found so , some will dear abide it .
poor soul !
his eyes are red as fire with weeping .
there ’ s not a nobler man in propn than propn .
but yesterday the word of propn might have stood against the world .
now lies he there , and none so poor to do him reverence .
o masters , if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , i should do propn wrong , and propn wrong— who , you all know , are honorable men .
i will not do them wrong .
i rather choose to wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , than i will wrong such honorable men .
but here ’ s a parchment with the seal of propn .
let but the commons hear this testament— which , pardon me , i do not mean to read— and they would go and kiss dead propn ’ s wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood , propn , beg a hair of him for memory , and , dying , mention it within their wills , bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue .
we ’ ll hear the will .
read it , propn propn !
the will , the will !
we will hear propn ’ s will .
it is not meet you know how propn loved you .
you are not wood , you are not stones , but men .
and , being men , bearing the will of propn , it will inflame you , it will make you mad .
read the will .
we ’ ll hear it , propn .
you shall read us the will , propn ’ s will .
will you be patient ?
will you stay awhile ?
i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it .
i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed propn .
they were traitors !
the testament !
they were villains , murderers .
the will !
read the will !
you will compel me , then , to read the will ?
then make a ring about the corpse of propn , and let me show you him that made the will .
shall i descend ?
and will you give me leave ?
come down .
descend .
you shall have leave .
stand from the hearse .
stand from the body .
room for propn , most noble propn !
nay , press not so upon me .
stand far off .
stand back .
room !
if you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
you all do know this mantle .
i remember the first time ever propn put it on .
twas on a summer ’ s evening in his tent , that day he overcame the propn .
look , in this place ran propn ' dagger through .
see what a rent the envious propn made .
for propn , as you know , was propn ’ s angel .
propn , o you gods , how dearly propn loved him !
this was the most unkindest cut of all .
then burst his mighty heart , and , in his mantle muffling up his face , even at the base of propn ’ s statue , which all the while ran blood , great propn fell .
o , what a fall was there , my countrymen !
then i , and you , and all of us fell down , propn bloody treason flourished over us .
oh , now you weep , and , i perceive , you feel the dint of pity .
these are gracious drops .
kind souls , what , weep you when you but behold our propn ’ s vesture wounded ?
look you here , here is himself , marred , as you see , with traitors .
o piteous spectacle !
o noble propn !
o woeful day !
o traitors , villains !
o most bloody sight !
about !
seek !
burn !
fire !
kill !
slay !
stay , countrymen .
peace there !
hear the noble propn .
they that have done this deed are honorable .
what private griefs they have , alas , i know not , that made them do it .
they are wise and honorable , and will , no doubt , with reasons answer you .
i come not , friends , to steal away your hearts .
for i have neither wit nor words nor worth , action nor utterance nor the power of speech , to stir men ’ s blood .
i only speak right on .
but were i propn , and propn propn , there were an propn would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of propn that should move the stones of propn to rise and mutiny .
we ’ ll mutiny .
we ’ ll burn the house of propn .
away , then !
come , seek the conspirators .
yet hear me , countrymen .
yet hear me speak .
peace , ho !
hear propn .
most noble propn !
why , friends , you go to do you know not what .
wherein hath propn thus deserved your loves ?
alas , you know not .
i must tell you then .
you have forgot the will i told you of .
most true .
the will !
let ’ s stay and hear the will .
most noble propn !
we ’ ll revenge his death .
o royal propn !
hear me with patience .
peace , ho !
moreover , he hath left you all his walks , his private arbors and new - planted orchards , on this side propn .
he hath left them you and to your heirs forever — common pleasures , to walk abroad and recreate yourselves .
here was a propn !
when comes such another ?
we ’ ll burn his body in the holy place , and with the brands fire the traitors ' houses .
take up the body .
go fetch fire .
now let it work .
how now , fellow ?
propn , propn is already come to propn .
where is he ?
he and propn are at propn ’ s house .
and thither will i straight to visit him .
he comes upon a wish .
propn is merry , and in this mood will give us anything .
i heard him say , propn and propn are rid like madmen through the gates of propn .
propn they had some notice of the people how i had moved them .
bring me to propn .
propn just .
and it is very much lamented , propn , that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow .
i have heard where many of the best respect in propn , except immortal propn , speaking of propn and groaning underneath this age ’ s yoke , have wished that noble propn had his eyes .
into what dangers would you lead me , propn , that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me ?
therefore , good propn , be prepared to hear .
and since you know you can not see yourself so well as by reflection , i , your glass , will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of .
and be not jealous on me , gentle propn .
were i a common laugher , or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester , if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and , after , scandal them , or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
what means this shouting ?
i do fear , the people propn propn for their king .
ay , do you fear it ?
then must i think you would not have it so .
i dreamt tonight that i did feast with propn , and things unlucky charge my fantasy .
i have no will to wander forth of doors , yet something leads me forth .
what is your name ?
propn are you going ?
where do you dwell ?
are you a married man or a bachelor ?
answer every man directly .
ay , and briefly .
ay , and wisely .
what is my name ?
propn am i going ?
where do i dwell ?
am i a married man or a bachelor ?
then , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly — wisely i say , i am a bachelor .
that ’ s as much as to say they are fools that marry .
you ’ ll bear me a bang for that , i fear .
directly , i am going to propn ’ s funeral .
as a friend or an enemy ?
as a friend .
propn , i dwell by the propn .
your name , sir , truly .
truly , my name is propn .
tear him to pieces .
he ’ s a conspirator .
i am not propn the conspirator .
it is no matter .
his name propn propn .
propn but his name out of his heart and turn him going .
tear him , tear him !
come , brands , ho , firebrands .
to propn ' , to propn ' , burn all .
some to decius ' house and some to propn propn .
some to propn ' .
away , go !
these many , then , shall die .
their names are pricked .
i do consent— propn him down , propn .
upon condition propn shall not live , who is your sister ’ s son , propn propn .
he shall not live .
look , with a spot i damn him .
but , propn , go you to propn ’ s house .
fetch the will hither , and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies .
what , shall i find you here ?
or here , or at the propn .
this is a slight , unmeritable man , propn to be sent on errands .
is it fit , the threefold world divided , he should stand one of the three to share it ?
propn , i have seen more days than you .
and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , to groan and sweat under the business , either led or driven , as we point the way .
and having brought our treasure where we will , then take we down his load and turn him off , like to the empty ass , to shake his ears and graze in commons .
you may do your will , but he ’ s a tried and valiant soldier .
so is my horse , propn , and for that i do appoint him store of provender .
stand , ho !
give the word , ho , and stand .
what now , propn ?
is cassius near ?
he is at hand , and propn is come to do you salutation from his master .
but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied .
he is not doubted .— a word , propn .
but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath used of old .
thou hast described a hot friend cooling .
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith .
but hollow men , like horses hot at hand , make gallant show and promise of their mettle .
but when they should endure the bloody spur , they fall their crests and , like deceitful jades , propn in the trial .
comes his army on ?
they mean this night in propn to be quartered .
the greater part , the horse in general , are come with propn .
propn !
he is arrived .
propn gently on to meet him .
stand , ho !
stand , ho !
speak the word along .
stand !
stand !
stand !
most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
judge me , you gods !
propn i mine enemies ?
and when you do them— propn , be content .
before the eyes of both our armies here , which should perceive nothing but love from us , let us not wrangle .
bid them move away .
then in my tent , propn , enlarge your griefs , and i will give you audience .
propn , propn our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground .
let propn and propn guard our door .
that you have wronged me doth appear in this : you have condemned and noted propn propn for taking bribes here of the propn , wherein my letters , praying on his side because i knew the man , were slighted off .
you wronged yourself to write in such a case .
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment .
let me tell you , propn , you yourself are much condemned to have an itching palm , to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers .
i “ an itching palm ” !
you know that you are propn that speak this , or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .
the name of propn honors this corruption , and chastisement doth therefore hide his head .
propn !
remember propn , the ides of propn remember .
did not great propn bleed for justice ' sake ?
what villain touched his body , that did stab , and not for justice ?
what , shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers , shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes , and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be graspèd thus ?
i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a propn .
propn , bait not me .
i ’ ll not endure it .
you forget yourself to hedge me in .
i am a soldier , i , older in practice , abler than yourself to make conditions .
go to .
you are not , propn .
i am .
i say you are not .
urge me no more , i shall forget myself .
have mind upon your health , tempt me no further .
away , slight man !
is ’ t possible ?
hear me , for i will speak .
shall i be frighted when a madman stares ?
but wherefore do you hold me here so long ?
what is it that you would impart to me ?
i know that virtue to be in you , propn , as well as i do know your outward favor .
well , honor is the subject of my story .
i can not tell what you and other men think of this life , but , for my single self , i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself .
i was born free as propn .
so were you .
we both have fed as well , and we can both endure the winter ’ s cold as well as he .
for once upon a raw and gusty day , the troubled propn chafing with her shores , propn said to me , “ propn thou , propn , now propn in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point ? ” upon the word , accoutred as i was , i plungèd in and bade him follow .
so indeed he did .
but ere we could arrive the point proposed , propn cried , “ help me , propn , or i sink ! ” i , as propn , our great ancestor , did from the flames of propn upon his shoulder the old propn bear , so from the waves of propn did i the tired propn .
all this ” ?
ay , more .
fret till your proud heart break .
go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble .
is it come to this ?
you say you are a better soldier .
let it appear so .
make your vaunting true , and it shall please me well .
for mine own part , i shall be glad to learn of noble men .
you wrong me every way .
you wrong me , propn .
when propn lived , he durst not thus have moved me .
peace , peace !
you durst not so have tempted him .
i durst not !
no .
for your life you durst not .
do not presume too much upon my love .
i may do that i shall be sorry for .
you have done that you should be sorry for .
there is no terror , propn , in your threats , for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind , which i respect not .
i did send to you for gold to pay my legions , which you denied me .
was that done like propn ?
should i have answered propn propn so ?
i denied you not .
you did .
i did not .
he was but a fool that brought my answer back .
propn hath rived my heart .
a friend should bear his friend ’ s infirmities , but propn makes mine greater than they are .
i do not , till you practice them on me .
you love me not .
i do not like your faults .
a friendly eye could never see such faults .
a flatterer ’ s would not , though they do appear as huge as high propn .
oh , i could weep my spirit from mine eyes .
sheathe your dagger .
be angry when you will , it shall have scope .
do what you will , dishonor shall be humor .
when i spoke that , i was ill - tempered too .
do you confess so much ?
give me your hand .
and my heart too .
o propn !
what ’ s the matter ?
have not you love enough to bear with me , when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful ?
yes , propn .
and from henceforth when you are over - earnest with your propn , he ’ ll think your mother chides and leave you so .
how now ?
what ’ s the matter ?
for shame , you generals !
what do you mean ?
love , and be friends as two such men should be .
for i have seen more years , i ’ m sure , than ye .
bear with him , propn .
propn his fashion .
i ’ ll know his humor when he knows his time .
what should the wars do with these jigging fools ?
companion , hence !
away , away , be gone .
propn and propn , bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight .
and come yourselves , and bring propn with you , immediately to us .
i did not think you could have been so angry .
o propn , i am sick of many griefs .
propn is dead .
ha , propn ?
she is dead .
o insupportable and touching loss !
upon what sickness ?
impatient of my absence , and grief that young propn with propn propn have made themselves so strong — for with her death that tidings came — with this she fell distract and , her attendants absent , swallowed fire .
and died so ?
even so .
o ye immortal gods !
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
propn , propn , till the wine o'erswell the cup .
i can not drink too much of propn ' love .
now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities .
propn , art thou gone ?
no more , i pray you .
propn , i have here receivèd letters that young propn and propn propn come down upon us with a mighty power , bending their expedition toward propn .
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .
with what addition ?
that by proscription and bills of outlawry , propn , propn , and propn have put to death an hundred senators .
therein our letters do not well agree .
mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions , cicero being one .
cicero one ?
cicero is dead , and by that order of proscription .
no , propn .
nor nothing in your letters writ of her ?
nothing , propn .
that methinks is strange .
why ask you ?
hear you aught of her in yours ?
no , my lord .
now , as you are a roman , tell me true .
then like a roman bear the truth i tell .
for certain she is dead , and by strange manner .
why , farewell , propn .
we must die , propn .
with meditating that she must die once , i have the patience to endure it now .
even so great men great losses should endure .
i have as much of this in art as you , but yet my nature could not bear it so .
well , to our work alive .
what do you think of marching to propn presently ?
i do not think it good .
your reason ?
this it is : ' propn better that the enemy seek us .
so shall he waste his means , weary his soldiers , doing himself offense , whilst we , lying still , are full of rest , defense , and nimbleness .
the enemy , marching along by them , by them shall make a fuller number up , come on refreshed , new - added , and encouraged , from which advantage shall we cut him off if at propn we do face him there , these people at our back .
hear me , good brother— under your pardon .
you must note beside , that we have tried the utmost of our friends , our legions are brim - full , our cause is ripe .
the enemy increaseth every day .
we , at the height , are ready to decline .
on such a full sea are we now afloat , and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures .
then , with your will , go on .
we ’ ll along ourselves , and meet them at propn .
the deep of night is crept upon our talk , and nature must obey necessity , which we will niggard with a little rest .
there is no more to say ?
no more .
good night .
early tomorrow will we rise and hence .
propn !
never come such division ’ tween our souls .
let it not , propn .
is now become a god , and propn is a wretched creature and must bend his body if propn carelessly but nod on him .
he had a fever when he was in propn , and when the fit was on him , i did mark how he did shake .
propn true , this god did shake !
his coward lips did from their color fly , and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster .
i did hear him groan , ay , and that tongue of his that bade the propn propn him and write his speeches in their books— “ alas , ” it cried , “ give me some drink , propn , ” as a sick girl .
ye gods , it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone .
another general shout !
i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on propn .
why , man , he doth bestride the narrow world like a propn , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves .
men at some time are masters of their fates .
the fault , dear propn , is not in our stars but in ourselves , that we are underlings .
propn and propn — what should be in that “ propn ” ?
why should that name be sounded more than yours ?
write them together , yours is as fair a name .
sound them , it doth become the mouth as well .
everything is well .
good night , my lord .
good night , good brother .
good night , propn propn .
propn , everyone .
give me the gown .
where is thy instrument ?
here in the tent .
what , thou speak ’ st drowsily ?
propn propn and some other of my men .
i ’ ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
propn and propn !
calls my lord ?
i pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep .
it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother propn .
so please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
look , propn , here ’ s the book i sought for so .
i put it in the pocket of my gown .
i was sure your lordship did not give it me .
propn thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , and touch thy instrument a strain or two ?
ay , my lord , an propn please you .
it does , my boy .
i trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .
it is my duty , sir .
i should not urge thy duty past thy might .
i know young bloods look for a time of rest .
i have slept , my lord , already .
it was well done , and thou shalt sleep again .
i will not hold thee long .
if i do live , i will be good to thee .
this is a sleepy tune .
o murderous slumber , propn thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music ? — propn knave , good night .
i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee .
and , good boy , good night .
let me see , let me see .
is not the leaf turned down where i left reading ?
here it is , i think .
i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition .
it comes upon me .— art thou any thing ?
art thou some god , some angel , or some devil that makest my blood cold and my hair to stare ?
speak to me what thou art .
thy evil spirit , propn .
why comest thou ?
to tell thee thou shalt see me at propn .
well , then i shall see thee again ?
ay , at propn .
why , i will see thee at propn , then .
ill spirit , i would hold more talk with thee .
claudio !
the strings , my lord , are false .
he thinks he still is at his instrument .
propn , awake .
my lord ?
propn thou dream , propn , that thou so criedst out ?
my lord , i do not know that i did cry .
yes , that thou didst .
propn thou see any thing ?
nothing , my lord .
my lord ?
my lord ?
why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?
did we , my lord ?
ay .
saw you anything ?
no , my lord , i saw nothing .
nor i , my lord .
go and commend me to my brother propn .
bid him set on his powers betimes before , and we will follow .
it shall be done , my lord .
now , propn , our hopes are answerèd .
you said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions .
it proves not so .
their battles are at hand .
they mean to warn us at propn here , answering before we do demand of them .
propn , i am in their bosoms , and i know propn they do it .
they could be content to visit other places , and come down with fearful bravery , thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage .
but ’ tis not so .
prepare you , generals .
the enemy comes on in gallant show .
their bloody sign of battle is hung out , and something to be done immediately .
propn , lead your battle softly on , upon the left hand of the even field .
upon the right hand i .
keep thou the left .
why do you cross me in this exigent ?
they stand and would have parley .
stand fast , propn .
we must out and talk .
propn propn , shall we give sign of battle ?
no , propn , we will answer on their charge .
make forth .
the generals would have some words .
words before blows .
is it so , countrymen ?
not that we love words better , as you do .
good words are better than bad strokes , propn .
in your bad strokes , propn , you give good words .
but for your words , they rob the propn bees and leave them honeyless .
not stingless too ?
villains , you did not so when your vile daggers hacked one another in the sides of propn .
flatterers ? — now , propn , thank yourself .
when think you that the sword goes up again ?
never , till propn propn three and thirty wounds be well avenged , or till another propn have added slaughter to the sword of traitors .
propn , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands unless thou bring ’ st them with thee .
so i hope .
i was not born to die on propn ' sword .
o , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , young man , thou couldst not die more honorable .
a peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honor , joined with a masker and a reveler !
propn propn still .
if you dare fight today , come to the field .
if not , when you have stomachs .
why , now , blow wind , swell billow , and swim bark !
the storm is up and all is on the hazard .
propn !
propn , this is my birthday , as this very day was propn born .
give me thy hand , propn .
be thou my witness that against my will , as propn was , am i compelled to set upon one battle all our liberties .
you know that i held propn strong and his opinion .
now i change my mind , and partly credit things that do presage .
coming from propn , on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell , and there they perched , gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands , who to propn here consorted us .
this morning are they fled away and gone , and in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites propn o'er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey .
their shadows seem a canopy most fatal , under which our army lies , ready to give up the ghost .
believe not so .
i but believe it partly , for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly .
now , most noble propn , the gods today stand friendly that we may , propn in peace , lead on our days to age .
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain , let ’ s reason with the worst that may befall .
if we do lose this battle , then is this the very last time we shall speak together .
what are you then determinèd to do ?
propn ” will start a spirit as soon as “ propn . ” now in the names of all the gods at once , upon what meat doth this our propn feed that he is grown so great ?
age , thou art shamed !
propn , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
when went there by an age , since the great flood , but it was famed with more than with one man ?
when could they say till now , that talked of propn , that her wide walks encompassed but one man ?
now is it propn indeed , and room enough , when there is in it but one only man .
oh , you and i have heard our fathers say , there was a propn once that would have brooked propn ' eternal devil to keep his state in propn as easily as a king .
that you do love me , i am nothing jealous .
what you would work me to , i have some aim .
how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter .
for this present , i would not , so with love i might entreat you , be any further moved .
what you have said i will consider , what you have to say i will with patience hear , and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things .
till then , my noble friend , chew upon this : propn had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of propn under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us .
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from propn .
then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph propn the streets of propn ?
no , propn , no .
think not , thou noble propn , that ever propn will go bound to propn .
he bears too great a mind .
therefore our everlasting farewell take .
forever and forever farewell , propn .
if we do meet again , why , we shall smile .
if not , why then this parting was well made .
forever and forever farewell , propn .
if we do meet again , we ’ ll smile indeed .
if not , ’ tis true this parting was well made .
why then , lead on .
oh , that a man might know the end of this day ’ s business ere it come !
but it sufficeth that the day will end , and then the end is known .— come , ho !
away !
ride , ride , propn , ride , and give these bills unto the legions on the other side .
let them set on at once , for i perceive but cold demeanor in propn ' wing , and sudden push gives them the overthrow .
ride , ride , propn .
myself have to mine own turned enemy .
o propn , propn gave the word too early , who , having some advantage on propn , took it too eagerly .
fly further off , my lord , fly further off .
propn propn is in your tents , my lord .
fly , therefore , noble propn , fly far off .
are those my tents where i perceive the fire ?
they are , my lord .
propn , if thou lovest me , propn thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again , that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
i will be here again , even with a thought .
go , propn , get higher on that hill .
my sight was ever thick .
propn propn , and tell me what thou notest about the field .
this day i breathed first .
propn is come round , and where i did begin , there shall i end .
my life is run his compass .
what news ?
and , hark !
they shout for joy .
come down , behold no more .
oh , coward that i am , to live so long to see my best friend ta'en before my face !
come hither , sirrah .
come now , keep thine oath .
propn , thou art revenged , even with the sword that killed thee .
so i am free .
yet would not so have been , propn i have done my will .
o propn , far from this country propn shall run , where never propn shall take note of him .
it is but change , propn , for propn is overthrown by noble propn ' power , as propn ' legions are by propn .
these tidings will well comfort propn .
where did you leave him ?
all disconsolate , with propn his bondman on this hill .
is not that he that lies upon the ground ?
he lies not like the living .
o my heart !
is not that he ?
what , propn !
where art thou , propn ?
seek him , propn , whilst i go to meet the noble propn , thrusting this report into his ears .
i may say “ thrusting ” it , for piercing steel and darts envenomèd shall be as welcome to the ears of propn as tidings of this sight .
hie you , propn , and i will seek for propn the while .
why didst thou send me forth , brave cassius ?
did i not meet thy friends ?
and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me give it thee ?
propn thou not hear their shouts ?
alas , thou hast misconstrued everything !
but , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow .
propn propn bid me give it thee , and i will do his bidding .
where , where , propn , doth his body lie ?
propn , yonder , and propn mourning it .
propn ' face is upward .
he is slain .
o propn propn , thou art mighty yet !
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails .
are yet two propn living such as these ?
the last of all the propn , fare thee well !
i shall find time , propn , i shall find time .
come , therefore , and to propn send his body .
let us to the field .
propn and propn , set our battles on .
propn three o'clock , and , propn , yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight .
what bastard doth not ?
who will go with me ?
i will proclaim my name about the field .
i am the son of propn propn , ho !
a foe to tyrants , and my country ’ s friend .
i am the son of propn propn , ho !
and i am propn , propn propn , i !
propn , my country ’ s friend .
know me for propn !
o young and noble propn , art thou down ?
only i yield to die .
there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight .
propn propn , and be honored in his death .
we must not .
a noble prisoner !
propn , ho !
tell propn propn is ta'en .
i ’ ll tell the news .
where is he ?
propn , propn .
i dare assure thee that no enemy shall ever take alive the noble propn .
the gods defend him from so great a shame !
the games are done and propn is returning .
as they pass by , pluck propn by the sleeve , and he will , after his sour fashion , tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today .
i will do so .
but , look you , propn , the angry spot doth glow on propn ’ s brow , and all the rest look like a chidden train .
propn ’ s cheek is pale , and propn looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the propn being crossed in conference by some senators .
propn will tell us what the matter is .
antonio .
propn .
come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .
propn showed the torchlight but , my lord , he came not back .
he is or ta'en or slain .
sit thee down , propn .
propn thee , propn .
what , i , my lord ?
no , not for all the world .
peace then !
no words .
i ’ ll rather kill myself .
propn thee , dardanius .
shall i do such a deed ?
o dardanius !
o propn !
come hither , good propn .
list a word .
what says my lord ?
at propn once , and this last night here in propn fields .
i know my hour is come .
not so , my lord .
nay , i am sure it is , propn .
thou seest the world , propn , how it goes .
our enemies have beat us to the pit .
it is more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us .
propn propn , propn know ’ st that we two went to school together .
even for that our love of old , i prithee , hold thou my sword hilts , whilst i run on it .
that ’ s not an office for a friend , my lord .
fly , fly , my lord .
there is no tarrying here .
farewell to you .— and you .— and you , propn .
propn , thou hast been all this while asleep .
i shall have glory by this losing day more than propn and propn propn by this vile conquest shall attain unto .
so fare you well at once , for propn ' tongue propn almost ended his life ’ s history .
night hangs upon mine eyes .
my bones would rest , that have but labored to attain this hour .
fly , my lord , fly .
hence .
i will follow .
i prithee , propn , stay thou by thy lord .
thou art a fellow of a good respect .
thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it .
hold then my sword and turn away thy face while i do run upon it .
wilt thou , propn ?
give me your hand first .
propn , good propn .
what man is that ?
free from the bondage you are in , propn .
all that served propn , i will entertain them .
propn , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
ay , if propn will prefer me to you .
do so , good propn .
how died my master , propn ?
i held the sword and he did run on it .
propn , then take him to follow thee , that did the latest service to my master .
this was the noblest propn of them all .
all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great propn .
he only in a general honest thought and common good to all , made one of them .
his life was gentle , and the elements so mixed in him that propn might stand up and say to all the world , “ this was a man . ” according to his virtue let us use him , with all respect and rites of burial .
within my tent his bones tonight shall lie most like a soldier , ordered honorably .
so call the field to rest , and let ’ s away to part the glories of this happy day .
ay , propn .
tell us what hath chanced today that propn looks so sad .
why , you were with him , were you not ?
i should not then ask propn what had chanced .
why , there was a crown offered him ; and , being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus ; and then the people fell a - shouting .
what was the second noise for ?
why , for that too .
they shouted thrice .
what was the last cry for ?
why , for that too .
was the crown offered him thrice ?
ay , marry , was propn , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every putting - by mine honest neighbors shouted .
who offered him the crown ?
why , propn .
tell us the manner of it , gentle propn .
i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it .
i saw propn propn offer him a crown ( yet ’ twas not a crown neither , ’ twas one of these coronets ) and , as i told you , he put it by once — but , for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it .
then he offered it to him again , then he put it by again — but , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .
and then he offered it the third time .
and for mine own part , i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air .
but soft , i pray you .
what , did propn swoon ?
he fell down in the marketplace , and foamed at mouth , and was speechless .
propn very like .
he hath the falling sickness .
no , propn hath it not .
but you and i and honest propn , we have the falling sickness .
i know not what you mean by that , but i am sure propn fell down .
what said he when he came unto himself ?
marry , before he fell down , when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown , he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut .
an i had been a man of any occupation , if i would not have taken him at a word , i would i might go to hell among the rogues .
and so he fell .
when he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said anything amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .
three or four wenches where i stood cried , “ alas , good soul ! ” and forgave him with all their hearts .
if propn had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .
and after that he came thus sad away ?
ay .
hence !
home , you idle creatures get you home !
is this a holiday ?
why , sir , a carpenter .
where is thy leather apron and thy rule ?
what dost thou with thy best apparel on ?
truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , i am but , as you would say , a cobbler .
but what trade art thou ?
answer me directly .
a trade , sir , that i hope i may use with a safe conscience , which is , indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .
what trade , thou knave ?
thou naughty knave , what trade ?
nay , i beseech you , sir , be not out with me .
yet , if you be out , sir , i can mend you .
what mean ’ st thou by that ?
mend ” me , thou saucy fellow ?
did cicero say anything ?
ay , he spoke propn .
to what effect ?
nay , an i tell you that , i ’ ll ne'er look you i ' th ' face again .
but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
but , for mine own part , it was greek to me .
i could tell you more news too .
propn and propn , for pulling scarfs off propn ’ s images , are put to silence .
fare you well .
there was more foolery yet , if i could remember it .
will you sup with me tonight , propn ?
no , i am promised forth .
will you dine with me tomorrow ?
ay , if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .
good .
i will expect you .
do so .
farewell both .
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be !
he was quick mettle when he went to school .
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise , however he puts on this tardy form .
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite .
and so it is .
for this time i will leave you .
tomorrow , if you please to speak with me , i will come home to you .
or , if you will , come home to me , and i will wait for you .
i will do so .
till then , think of the world .
well , propn , thou art noble .
propn doth bear me hard , but he loves propn .
if i were propn now and he were propn , he should not humor me .
i will this night , in several hands , in at his windows throw , as if they came from several citizens , writings all tending to the great opinion that propn holds of his name , wherein obscurely propn ’ s ambition shall be glancèd at .
brought you propn home ?
o cicero , i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks , and i have seen propn ' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds , but never till tonight , never till now , did i go through a tempest dropping fire .
either there is a civil strife in propn , or else the world , too saucy with the gods , incenses them to send destruction .
besides — i ha ' not since put up my sword— against the propn i met a lion , who glared upon me and went surly by , without annoying me .
and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women , propn with their fear , who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets .
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon - day upon the marketplace , propn and shrieking .
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet , let not men say , “ these are their reasons .
they are natural . ” for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon .
indeed , it is a strange - disposèd time .
but men may construe things after their fashion , clean from the purpose of the things themselves .
comes propn to the propn tomorrow ?
he doth , for he did bid propn send word to you he would be there tomorrow .
good night then , propn .
this disturbèd sky is not to walk in .
a propn .
propn , by your voice .
your ear is good .
propn , what night is this !
a very pleasing night to honest men .
who ever knew the heavens menace so ?
those that have known the earth so full of faults .
for my part , i have walked about the streets , submitting me unto the perilous night , and , thus unbracèd , propn , as you see , have bared my bosom to the thunder - stone .
and when the cross blue lightning seemed to open the breast of propn , i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it .
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ?
it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us .
you are dull , propn , and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want , or else you use not .
you look pale , and gaze , and put on fear , and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens .
a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action , yet prodigious grown , and fearful as these strange eruptions are .
let it be who it is .
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
indeed , they say the senators tomorrow propn to establish propn as a king , and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in propn .
i know where i will wear this dagger then .
cassius from bondage will deliver propn .
therein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong .
therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat .
nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit .
but life , being weary of these worldly bars , never lacks power to dismiss itself .
if i know this , know all the world besides , that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure .
so can i .
so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity .
and why should propn be a tyrant then ?
poor man !
i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the propn are but sheep .
he were no lion were not propn hinds .
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws .
but , o grief , where hast thou led me ?
then i know my answer must be made .
you speak to propn , and to such a man that is no fleering telltale .
hold , my hand .
be factious for redress of all these griefs , and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest .
there ’ s a bargain made .
now know you , propn , i have moved already some certain of the noblest - minded propn to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable - dangerous consequence .
and i do know by this they stay for me in propn ’ s porch .
propn propn .
i do know him by his gait .
to find out you .
who ’ s that ?
propn propn ?
no , it is propn , one incorporate to our attempts .
am i not stayed for , propn ?
i am glad on propn .
what a fearful night is this !
there ’ s two or three of us have seen strange sights .
am i not stayed for ?
tell me .
yes , you are .
o propn , if you could but win the noble propn to our party— be you content .
propn propn , take this paper , and look you lay it in the praetor ’ s chair where propn may but find it .
all this done , propn to propn ’ s porch , where you shall find us .
is propn propn and propn there ?
all but propn propn , and he ’ s gone to seek you at your house .
well , i will hie , and so bestow these papers as you bade me .
that done , repair to propn ’ s theatre .
come , propn , you and i will yet ere day see propn at his house .
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited .
let us go , for it is after midnight , and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him .
propn , i say !
what , propn !
called you , my lord ?
get me a taper in my study , propn .
when it is lighted , come and call me here .
i will , my lord .
it must be by his death , and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general .
he would be crowned .
how that might change his nature , there ’ s the question .
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking .
propn him that , and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with .
why , sir , cobble you .
thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
truly , sir , all that i live by is with the awl .
i meddle with no tradesman ’ s matters nor women ’ s matters , but withal i am indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes .
when they are in great danger , i recover them .
as proper men as ever trod upon neat ’ s leather have gone upon my handiwork .
but wherefore art not in thy shop today ?
why dost thou lead these men about the streets ?
truly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work .
wherefore rejoice ?
what conquest brings he home ?
what tributaries follow him to propn to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
th ' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power .
so propn may .
then , lest he may , prevent .
and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is , propn it thus : that what he is , augmented , would run to these and these extremities .
the taper burneth in your closet , sir .
searching the window for a flint , i found this paper , thus sealed up , and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed .
get you to bed again .
it is not day .
is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of propn ?
i know not , sir .
look in the calendar and bring me word .
i will , sir .
propn , propn is wasted fifteen days .
propn good .
go to the gate .
somebody knocks .
since propn first did whet me against propn , i have not slept .
is he alone ?
do you know them ?
let 'em enter .
o conspiracy , propn thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free ?
o , then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage ?
hide it in smiles and affability .
i think we are too bold upon your rest .
good morrow , propn .
do we trouble you ?
i have been up this hour , awake all night .
know i these men that come along with you ?
this is propn .
he is welcome hither .
this , propn propn .
he is welcome too .
this , propn .
this , propn .
and this , propn propn .
they are all welcome .
what watchful cares do interpose themselves propn your eyes and night ?
shall i entreat a word ?
here lies the east .
doth not the day break here ?
no .
you shall confess that you are both deceived .
and let us swear our resolution .
no , not an oath .
so let high - sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery .
but if these— as i am sure they do — bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress ?
what other bond than secret propn that have spoke the word and will not palter ?
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged , that this shall be , or we will fall for it ?
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs .
unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt .
but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise , nor th ' insuppressive mettle of our spirits , to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath , when every drop of blood that every roman bears — and nobly bears— is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passed from him .
but what of propn ?
shall we sound him ?
i think he will stand very strong with us .
let us not leave him out .
no , by no means .
o , let us have him , for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men ’ s voices to commend our deeds .
it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands .
o , name him not .
let us not break with him , for he will never follow anything that other men begin .
then leave him out .
indeed he is not fit .
decius , well urged .
i think it is not meet propn propn , so well beloved of propn , should outlive propn .
we shall find of him a shrewd contriver .
and , you know , his means , if he improve them , may well stretch so far as to annoy us all ; which to prevent , let propn and propn fall together .
our course will seem too bloody , propn propn , to cut the head off and then hack the limbs , like wrath in death and envy afterwards , for propn is but a limb of propn .
let us be sacrificers but not butchers , propn .
we all stand up against the spirit of propn , and in the spirit of men there is no blood .
oh , that we then could come by propn ’ s spirit and not propn propn !
but , alas , propn must bleed for it .
and , gentle friends , let ’ s kill him boldly but not wrathfully .
let ’ s carve him as a dish fit for the gods , not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds .
and let our hearts , as subtle masters do , stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide 'em .
this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious , which so appearing to the common eyes , we shall be called purgers , not murderers .
if he love propn , all that he can do is to himself : take thought and die for propn .
and that were much he should , for he is given to sports , to wildness and much company .
there is no fear in him .
peace !
count the clock .
the clock hath stricken three .
propn time to part .
it may be , these apparent prodigies , the unaccustomed terror of this night , and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the propn today .
never fear that .
if he be so resolved , i can o'ersway him .
for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betrayed with trees , and bears with glasses , elephants with holes , lions with toils , and men with flatterers .
but when i tell him he hates flatterers , he says he does , being then most flatterèd .
let me work .
for i can give his humor the true bent , and i will bring him to the propn .
nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
by the eighth hour .
is that the uttermost ?
propn propn doth bear propn hard , who rated him for speaking well of propn .
i wonder none of you have thought of him .
now , good propn , go along by him .
he loves me well , and i have given him reasons .
send him but hither and i ’ ll fashion him .
the morning comes upon propn .
we ’ ll leave you , propn .
and , friends , disperse yourselves .
but all remember what you have said , and show yourselves true propn .
good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily .
and so good morrow to you every one .
boy !
lucius ! —fast asleep ?
it is no matter .
enjoy the honey - heavy dew of slumber .
therefore thou propn so sound .
propn , my lord .
propn , what mean you ?
it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw , cold morning .
nor for yours neither .
propn ' have ungently , propn , stole from my bed .
and yesternight , at supper , you suddenly arose and walked about , propn and sighing , with your arms across , and when i asked you what the matter was , you stared upon me with ungentle looks .
i urged you further , then you scratched your head and too impatiently stamped with your foot .
yet i insisted ; yet you answered not , but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you .
dear my lord , make me acquainted with your cause of grief .
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over propn ’ s blood ?
be gone !
run to your houses , fall upon your knees , pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude .
go , go , good countrymen , and for this fault , assemble all the poor men of your sort , draw them to propn banks , and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all .
go you down that way towards the propn .
this way will propn propn the images if you do find them decked with ceremonies .
may we do so ?
i ’ ll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets .
so do you too , where you perceive them thick .
these growing feathers plucked from propn ’ s wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch , who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness .
i am not well in health , and that is all .
propn is wise , and were he not in health , he would embrace the means to come by it .
why , so i do .
good propn , go to bed .
is propn sick ?
and is it physical to walk unbracèd and suck up the humors of the dank morning ?
what , is propn sick , and will he steal out of his wholesome bed , to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air to add unto his sickness ?
propn not , gentle propn .
you are my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart .
if this were true , then should i know this secret .
i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman that propn propn took to wife .
i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman well - reputed , propn ’ s daughter .
think you i am no stronger than my sex , being so fathered and so husbanded ?
tell me your counsels .
i will not disclose 'em .
i have made strong proof of my constancy , giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh .
can i bear that with patience , and not my husband ’ s secrets ?
o ye gods , render me worthy of this noble wife !
propn , hark !
one knocks .
leave me with haste .
propn , who ’ s that knocking ?
he is a sick man that would speak with you .
would you were not sick !
i am not sick if propn have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honor .
such an exploit have i in hand , propn , had you a healthful ear to hear of it .
a piece of work that will make sick men whole .
but are not some whole that we must make sick ?
that must we also .
what it is , my propn , i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done .
follow me , then .
nor propn nor earth have been at peace tonight .
propn hath propn in her sleep cried out , “ help , ho !
they murder propn ’ s within ?
my lord .
go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success .
i will , my lord .
what mean you , propn ?
think you to walk forth ?
you shall not stir out of your house today .
propn shall forth .
the things that threatened me ne'er looked but on my back .
when they shall see the face of propn , they are vanishèd .
propn , i never stood on ceremonies , yet now they fright me .
there is one within , besides the things that we have heard and seen , propn most horrid sights seen by the watch .
a lioness hath whelpèd in the streets , and graves have yawned and yielded up their dead .
fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war , which drizzled blood upon the propn .
o propn !
these things are beyond all use , and i do fear them .
what can be avoided propn end is purposed by the mighty gods ?
yet propn shall go forth , for these predictions are to the world in general as to propn .
when beggars die there are no comets seen .
the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
cowards die many times before their deaths .
the valiant never taste of death but once .
of all the wonders that i yet have heard , it seems to me most strange that men should fear , seeing that death , a necessary end , will come when it will come .
what say the augurers ?
they would not have you to stir forth today .
plucking the entrails of an offering forth , they could not find a heart within the beast .
the gods do this in shame of cowardice .
propn should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear .
no , propn shall not .
we are two lions littered in one day , and i the elder and more terrible .
and propn shall go forth .
alas , my lord , your wisdom is consumed in confidence .
do not go forth today .
call it my fear that keeps you in the house , and not your own .
we ’ ll send propn propn to the senate house , and he shall say you are not well today .
propn propn shall say i am not well , and for thy humor i will stay at home .
here ’ s propn propn .
he shall tell them so .
propn , all hail !
good morrow , worthy propn .
i come to fetch you to the senate house .
and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today .
propn propn send a lie ?
have i in conquest stretched mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?
propn , go tell them propn will not come .
most mighty propn , let me know some cause , propn i be laughed at when i tell them so .
the cause is in my will .
i will not come .
that is enough to satisfy the senate .
but for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i will let you know .
propn here , my wife , stays me at home .
and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent , and on her knee propn begged that i will stay at home today .
this dream is all amiss interpreted .
it was a vision fair and fortunate .
your statue spouting blood in many pipes , in which so many smiling propn bathed , signifies that from you great propn shall suck reviving blood , and that great men shall press for tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance .
this by propn ’ s dream is signified .
and this way have you well expounded it .
i have , when you have heard what i can say .
and know it now : the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty propn .
if you shall send them word you will not come , their minds may change .
how foolish do your fears seem now , propn !
i am ashamèd i did yield to them .
give me my robe , for i will go .
and look , where propn is come to fetch me .
good morrow , propn .
welcome , propn .
good morrow , propn .— propn propn , propn was ne'er so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean .
what is propn o'clock ?
propn , propn strucken eight .
i thank you for your pains and courtesy .
so to most noble propn .
i am to blame to be thus waited for .
now , propn .— now , propn .— what , propn , i have an hour ’ s talk in store for you .
remember that you call on me today .
be near me , that i may remember you .
propn , i will .
good friends , go in and taste some wine with me .
and we , like friends , will straightway go together .
propn !
peace , ho !
propn speaks .
propn !
here , my lord .
propn , my lord .
i shall remember .
when propn says , “ do this , ” it is performed .
set on , and leave no ceremony out .
propn !
propn , beware of propn .
take heed of propn .
come not near propn .
have an eye to propn .
trust not propn .
propn well propn propn .
propn propn loves thee not .
thou hast wronged propn propn .
there is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against propn .
if thou beest not immortal , look about you .
security gives way to conspiracy .
the mighty gods defend thee !
propn lover , propn ” here will i stand till propn pass along , and as a suitor will i give him this .
if thou read this , propn propn , thou mayst live .
if not , the propn with traitors do contrive .
i prithee , boy , run to the senate house .
stay not to answer me , but get thee gone .
i would have had thee there and here again propn i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there .
propn , what should i do ?
run to the propn , and nothing else ?
and so return to you , and nothing else ?
yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , for he went sickly forth .
and take good note what propn doth , what suitors press to him .
propn , boy !
what noise is that ?
i hear none , madam .
prithee , listen well .
sooth , madam , i hear nothing .
come hither , fellow .
which way hast thou been ?
at mine own house , good lady .
what is propn o'clock ?
about the ninth hour , lady .
is propn yet gone to the propn ?
propn , not yet .
i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the propn .
thou hast some suit to propn , hast thou not ?
that i have , lady .
if it will please propn to be so good to propn as to hear me , i shall beseech him to befriend himself .
why , propn thou any harm ’ s intended towards him ?
none that i know will be ; much that i fear may chance .
good morrow to you .
here the street is narrow .
the throng that follows propn at the heels , of senators , of praetors , common suitors , will crowd a feeble man almost to death .
i ’ ll get me to a place more void , and there speak to great propn as he comes along .
i must go in .
ay , propn , but not gone .
o propn , read mine first , for mine propn a suit that touches propn nearer .
read it , great propn .
what touches us ourself shall be last served .
propn not , propn .
read it instantly .
what , is the fellow mad ?
weapons , arms ?
what ’ s the matter here ?
keep peace , upon your lives .
he dies that strikes again .
what is the matter ?
the messengers from our sister and the king .
what is your difference ?
speak .
i am scarce in breath , my lord .
a tailor made thee .
thou art a strange fellow .
a tailor make a man ?
ay , a tailor , sir .
a stone - cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o ' th ' trade .
speak yet .
peace , sirrah !
you beastly knave , know you no reverence ?
yes , sir , but anger hath a privilege .
why art thou angry ?
smile you my speeches as i were a fool ?
why , art thou mad , old fellow ?
why dost thou call him “ knave ” ?
what ’ s his offense ?
his countenance likes me not .
no more perchance does mine , nor his , nor hers .
this is some fellow , who , having been praised for bluntness , doth affect a saucy roughness and constrains the garb quite from his nature .
he can not flatter , he .
an honest mind and plain , he must speak truth .
an they will take it , so .
if not , he ’ s plain .
propn , in good faith , or in sincere verity , under th ' allowance of your great aspect , whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire on flickering propn ' front— what mean ’ st by this ?
to go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much .
i know , sir , i am no flatterer .
i never gave him any .
none of these rogues and cowards but propn is their fool .
call not your stocks for me .
i serve the king , on whose employment i was sent to you .
you shall do small respect , show too bold malice against the grace and person of my master , stocking his messenger .
fetch forth the stocks !
as i have life and honor , there shall he sit till noon .
till noon ?
till night , my lord , and all night too .
why , madam , if i were your father ’ s dog , you should not use me so .
propn , being his knave , i will .
this is a fellow of the selfsame color our sister speaks of .— come , bring away the stocks !
let me beseech your grace not to do so .
his fault is much , and the good king his master will check him for propn .
the king his master needs must take it ill , that he , so slightly valued in his messenger , should have him thus restrained .
i ’ ll answer that .
my sister may receive it much more worse to have her gentleman abused , assaulted for following her affairs .— put in his legs .
i am sorry for thee , friend .
i ’ ll entreat for thee .
pray you do not , sir .
a good man ’ s fortune may grow out at heels .
give you good morrow .
the duke propn to blame in this .
propn be ill taken .
obey you , love you , and most honor you .
haply when i shall we d that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him , half my care and duty .
sure , i shall never marry like my sisters , to love my father all .
but goes thy heart with this ?
ay , good my lord .
so young and so untender ?
so young , my lord , and true .
let it be so .
thy truth then be thy dower .
the barbarous scythian , or he that makes his generation messes to gorge his appetite , shall to my bosom be as well neighbored , pitied , and relieved as thou my sometime daughter .
good my liege— peace , propn .
i heard myself proclaimed , and by the happy hollow of a tree escaped the hunt .
no port is free , no place that guard and most unusual vigilance does not attend my taking .
my face i ’ ll grime with filth , propn my loins , elf all my hair in knots , and with presented nakedness outface the winds and persecutions of the sky .
poor propn ! ” “ poor tom ! ” — that ’ s something yet .
propn i nothing am .
propn strange that they should so depart from home , and not send back my messenger .
as i learned , the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove .
ha !
propn thou this shame thy pastime ?
no , my lord .
ha , ha !
look , he wears cruel garters .
horses are tied by the heads , dogs and bears by the neck , monkeys by the loins , and men by the legs .
it is both he and she : your son and daughter .
no .
yes .
no , no , they would not .
yes , they have .
by propn , i swear “ no . ” by propn , i swear “ ay . ” they durst not do propn .
they could not , would not do propn .
propn worse than murder to do upon respect such violent outrage .
my lord , when at their home i did commend your highness ' letters to them .
he raised the house with loud and coward cries .
your son and daughter found this trespass worth the shame which here it suffers .
fathers that wear rags do make their children blind .
but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind .
propn , that arrant whore , propn turns the key to th ' poor .
but for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year .
o , how this mother swells up toward my heart !
with the earl , sir , here within .
follow me not .
stay here .
made you no more offense but what you speak of ?
none .
how chance the king comes with so small a train ?
an thou hadst been set i ' th ' stocks for that question , thou ’ dst well deserved it .
why , propn ?
we ’ ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there ’ s no laboring i ' th ' winter .
all that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men , and there ’ s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that ’ s stinking .
let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill , lest it break thy neck with following it .
but the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after .
when a wise man gives thee better counsel , give me mine again .
i would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it .
that sir which serves and seeks for gain , and follows but for form , will pack when it begins to rain and leave thee in the storm .
but i will tarry .
the fool will stay .
and let the wise man fly .
where learned you this , propn ?
not i ' th ' stocks , fool .
deny to speak with me ?
they are sick ?
they are weary ?
the images of revolt and flying off .
my dear lord , you know the fiery quality of the duke , how unremoveable and fixed he is in his own course .
vengeance , plague , death , confusion !
fiery ” ?
what “ quality ” ?
why , propn , propn , i ’ d speak with the propn of propn and his wife .
well , my good lord , i have informed them so .
informed them ” ?
dost thou understand me , man ?
ay , my good lord .
the king would speak with propn .
are they “ informed ” of this ?
my breath and blood !
fiery ” ?
the “ fiery ” duke ?
tell the hot duke that lear— no , but not yet .
maybe he is not well .
i would have all well betwixt you .
o me , my heart , my rising heart !
but down .
good morrow to you both .
hail to your grace .
i am glad to see your highness .
propn , i think you are .
i know what reason i have to think so : if thou shouldst not be glad , i would divorce me from thy mother ’ s tomb , sepulchring an adultress .
propn propn , propn sister ’ s naught .
o propn , she hath tied sharp - toothed unkindness , like a vulture , here .
i pray you , sir , take patience .
say , how is that ?
i can not think my sister in the least would fail her obligation .
if , sir , perchance she have restrained the riots of your followers , ' propn on such ground and to such wholesome end as clears her from all blame .
my curses on her !
o sir , you are old .
nature in you stands on the very verge of his confine .
you should be ruled and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself .
therefore i pray you that to our sister you do make return .
say you have wronged her , sir .
ask her forgiveness ?
on my knees i beg that you ’ ll vouchsafe me raiment , bed , and food . ” good sir , no more .
these are unsightly tricks .
return you to my sister .
propn , sir , fie !
you nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes !
infect her beauty , you fen - sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun , to fall and blister !
o the blessed gods !
so will you wish on me when the rash mood is on .
her eyes are fierce , but thine do comfort and not burn .
thy half o ' th ' kingdom hast thou not forgot , wherein i thee endowed .
good sir , to the purpose .
hence , and avoid my sight ! — so be my grave my peace as here i give her father ’ s heart from her .— propn propn .
propn propn propn and propn , with my two daughters ' dowers digest this third .
let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her .
propn propn , whom i have ever honored as my king , loved as my father , as my master followed , as my great patron thought on in my prayers— the bow is bent and drawn .
let it fall rather , though the fork invade the region of my heart .
be propn unmannerly when propn is mad .
what wouldst thou do , old man ?
think ’ st thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows ?
to plainness honor ’ s bound when majesty falls to folly .
what trumpet propn that ?
i know propn — my sister propn .
this approves her letter that she would soon be here .
this is a slave whose easy borrowed pride propn in the fickle grace of her he follows.— out , varlet , from my sight !
what means your grace ?
who stocked my servant ?
propn , i have good hope propn didst not know on propn .— who comes here ?
o propn , wilt thou take her by the hand ?
how have i offended ?
i set him there , sir , but his own disorders deserved much less advancement .
you !
did you ?
i pray you , father , being weak , seem so .
if till the expiration of your month , you will return and sojourn with my sister , dismissing half your train , come then to me .
i am now from home , and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment .
return to her , and fifty men dismissed ?
return with her ?
why , the hot - blooded propn that dowerless took our youngest born — i could as well be brought to knee his throne , and , squirelike , pension beg to keep base life afoot .
return with her ?
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to this detested groom .
at your choice , sir .
now , i prithee , daughter , do not make me mad .
i will not trouble thee , my child .
we ’ ll no more meet , no more see one another .
but yet thou art my flesh , my blood , my daughter— or rather a disease that ’ s in my flesh , which i must needs call mine .
thou art a boil , a plague - sore or embossèd carbuncle in my corrupted blood .
but i ’ ll not chide thee .
i do not bid the thunder - bearer shoot , nor tell tales of thee to high - judging propn .
mend when thou canst .
be better at thy leisure .
i can be patient .
i can stay with propn , i and my hundred knights .
not altogether so , sir .
i looked not for you yet , nor am provided for your fit welcome .
give ear , sir , to my sister .
for those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old , and so— but she knows what she does .
i dare avouch it , sir .
how , in one house , should many people under two commands hold amity ?
propn hard ; almost impossible .
why might not you , my lord , receive attendance from those that she calls servants , or from mine ?
why not , my lord ?
if then they chanced to slack you , we could control them .
if you will come to me— for now i spy a danger — i entreat you to bring but five and twenty .
to no more will i give place or notice .
i gave you all— and in good time you gave it .
made you my guardians , my depositaries , but kept a reservation to be followed with such a number .
what , must i come to you with five and twenty , propn ?
said you so ?
and speak propn again , my lord .
no more with me .
not being the worst propn in some rank of praise .
hear me , my lord .
what need you five and twenty , ten , or five to follow in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you ?
what need one ?
o , reason not the need !
thou art a lady .
if only to go warm were gorgeous , why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear ’ st , which scarcely keeps thee warm .
but , for true need— you heavens , give me that patience , patience i need .
you see me here , you gods , a poor old man , as full of grief as age , wretched in both .
if it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts against their father , fool me not so much to bear it tamely .
no , you unnatural hags ,
i will have such revenges on you both that all the world shall — i will do such things— what they are yet i know not , but they shall be the terrors of the earth .
you think i ’ ll weep ?
no , i ’ ll not weep .
i have full cause of weeping , but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , or ere i ’ ll weep .— o propn , i shall go mad !
let us withdraw .
propn be a storm .
this house is little .
the old man and his people can not be well bestowed .
propn his own blame .
propn put himself from rest , and must needs taste his folly .
so am i purposed .
where is my lord of propn ?
followed the old man forth .
he is returned .
propn is he going ?
he calls to horse , but will i know not whither .
propn best to give him way .
he leads himself .
for many miles about there ’ s scarce a bush .
o sir , to wilful men , the injuries that they themselves procure must be their schoolmasters .
shut up your doors .
he is attended with a desperate train .
and what they may incense him to , being apt to have his ear abused , wisdom bids fear .
shut up your doors , my lord .
propn a wild night .
my propn counsels well .
come out o ' th ' storm .
who ’ s there , besides foul weather ?
one minded like the weather , most unquietly .
i know you .
where ’ s the king ?
contending with the fretful elements .
bids the winds blow the earth into the sea or swell the curlèd water ' bove the main , that things might change or cease .
tears his white hair , which the impetuous blasts , with eyeless rage , catch in their fury and make nothing of .
strives in his little world of man to outscorn the to - and - fro – conflicting wind and rain .
this night — wherein the cub - drawn bear would couch , the lion and the belly - pinchèd wolf keep their fur dry — unbonneted he runs , and bids what will take all .
but who is with him ?
none but the fool , who labors to outjest his heart - struck injuries .
propn , i do know you , and dare upon the warrant of my note propn a dear thing to you .
from propn there comes a power into this scattered kingdom , who already , wise in our negligence , have secret feet in some of our best ports and are at point to show their open banner .
now to you .
i am a gentleman of blood and breeding , and from some knowledge and assurance offer this office to you .
i will talk further with you .
give me your hand .
have you no more to say ?
rage , blow !
you cataracts and hurricanoes , spout till you have drenched our steeples , drowned the cocks !
you sulfurous and thought - executing fires , propn - couriers of oak - cleaving thunderbolts , singe my white head !
and thou , all - shaking thunder , propn flat the thick rotundity o ' th ' world , propn nature ’ s molds , all germens spill at once that make ingrateful man !
o nuncle , court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o ' door .
good nuncle , in , and ask thy daughters blessing .
here ’ s a night pities neither wise man nor fool .
rumble thy bellyful !
propn , fire !
spout , rain !
nor rain , wind , thunder , fire are my daughters .
i tax not you , you elements , with unkindness .
why then , let fall your horrible pleasure .
here i stand , your slave— a poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man .
he that has a house to put ’ s head in has a good headpiece .
answer my life my judgment , propn youngest daughter does not love thee least , nor are those empty - hearted whose low sound propn no hollowness .
propn , on thy life , no more .
out of my sight !
see better , propn , and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye .
now , by propn now , by propn , propn , propn swear ’ st thy gods in vain .
o vassal !
propn !
dear sir , forbear !
hear me , recreant !
for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass .
no , i will be the pattern of all patience .
i will say nothing .
who ’ s there ?
marry , here ’ s grace and a codpiece — that ’ s a wise man and a fool .
let the great gods that keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads find out their enemies now .
some friendship will it lend you ' gainst the tempest .
repose you there , while i to this hard house— more harder than the stones whereof ’ tis raised , which even but now , demanding after you , denied me to come in — return , and force their scanted courtesy .
my wits begin to turn.— come on , my boy .
true , my good boy .— come , bring us to this hovel .
i ’ ll speak a prophecy ere i go .
then comes the time , who lives to see propn , that going shall be used with feet .
this prophecy propn shall make , for i live before his time .
propn , alack , propn , i like not this unnatural dealing .
when i desire their leave that i might pity him , they took from me the use of mine own house , charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him , entreat for him , nor any way sustain him .
most savage and unnatural !
go to , say you nothing .
there ’ s a division betwixt the dukes .
propn dangerous to be spoken .
i have locked the letter in my closet .
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged home .
there ’ s part of a power already footed .
we must incline to the king .
i will look him and privily relieve him .
go you and maintain talk with the duke , that my charity be not of him perceived .
if he ask for me , i am ill and gone to bed .
though i die for it — as no less is threatened me — the king my old master must be relieved .
there is some strange thing toward , propn .
pray you , be careful .
this courtesy , forbid thee , shall the duke instantly know , and of that letter too .
the younger rises when the old doth fall .
here is the place , my lord .
good my lord , enter .
the tyranny of the open night propn too rough for nature to endure .
let me alone .
good my lord , enter here .
propn break my heart ?
i had rather break mine own .
good my lord , enter .
propn think ’ st ’ tis much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin .
so ’ tis to thee .
but where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt .
thou ’ dst shun a bear , but if thy flight lay toward the raging sea propn meet the bear i ' th ' mouth .
when the mind ’ s free , the body ’ s delicate .
the tempest in my mind propn from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there — filial ingratitude .
is it not as this mouth should tear this hand for lifting food to propn ?
but i will punish home .
no , i will weep no more .
in such a night to shut me out !
pour on , i will endure .
in such a night as this !
o propn , propn , your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all— oh , that way madness lies .
let me shun that .
no more of that .
good my lord , enter here .
prithee , go in thyself .
seek thine own ease .
this tempest will not give me leave to ponder on things would hurt me more .
but i ’ ll go in .
expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , that thou mayst shake the superflux to them and show the heavens more just .
come not in here , nuncle .
here ’ s a spirit .
help me , help me !
give me thy hand .
who ’ s there ?
a spirit , a spirit .
he says his name propn propn propn .
what art thou that dost grumble there i ' th ' straw ?
come forth .
away !
the foul fiend follows me !
through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind .
hum !
go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
propn thou give all to thy two daughters , and art thou come to this ?
bless thy five wits .
propn propn a - cold .
oh , do - de , do - de , do - de .
bless thee from whirlwinds , star - blasting , and taking !
do propn propn some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes .
there could i have him now — and there — and there again — and there .
what , has his daughters brought him to this pass ? — propn thou save nothing ?
propn thou give 'em all ?
nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
now all the plagues that in the pendulous air propn fated o'er men ’ s faults light on thy daughters !
he hath no daughters , sir .
death , traitor !
nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters .
is it the fashion that discarded fathers should have thus little mercy on their flesh ?
twas this flesh begot those pelican daughters .
this cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen .
take heed o ' th ' foul fiend .
obey thy parents , keep thy word ’ s justice , swear not , commit not with man ’ s sworn spouse , set not thy sweet heart on proud array .
propn propn a- cold .
what hast thou been ?
wine loved i deeply , dice dearly , and in woman outparamoured the propn .
still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind , says , “ propn , mun , nonny . ” propn my boy , my boy , cessez .
thou art the thing itself .
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor , bare , forked animal as thou propn propn , off , you lendings !
propn here .
prithee , nuncle , be contented .
propn a naughty night to swim in .
now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher ’ s heart — a small spark , all the rest on ’ s body cold .
look , here comes a walking fire .
this is the foul fiend propn .
he begins at curfew and walks till the first cock .
and aroint thee , witch , aroint thee !
how fares your grace ?
who ’ s there ?
what is propn you seek ?
what are you there ?
your names ?
peace , propn .
propn he ’ s called , and propn .
propn propn propn a - cold .
go in with me .
my duty can not suffer to obey in all your daughters ' hard commands .
though their injunction be to bar my doors and let this tyrannous night take hold upon you , yet have i ventured to come seek you out and bring you where both fire and food is ready .
first let me talk with this philosopher.—
away !
by propn , this shall not be revoked .
why , fare thee well , propn .
here ’ s propn and propn , my noble lord .
my lord of propn .
we first address towards you , who with this king propn rivaled for our daughter .
let me ask you one word in private .
propn thou blame him ?
his daughters seek his death .
ah , that good kent— he said it would be thus , poor banished man .
thou propn the king grows mad .
i ’ ll tell thee , friend , i am almost mad myself .
i had a son , now outlawed from my blood .
he sought my life , but lately , very late .
i loved him , friend— no father his son dearer .
what a night propn this !
o , cry your mercy , propn propn propn a - cold .
keep thee warm .
come let ’ s in all .
this way , my lord .
come , good propn .
i will have my revenge ere i depart his house .
how , my lord , i may be censured , that nature thus gives way to loyalty , something fears me to think of .
i now perceive it was not altogether your brother ’ s evil disposition made him seek his death , but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself .
how malicious is my fortune , that i must repent to be just !
go with me to the duchess .
if the matter of this paper be certain , you have mighty business in hand .
true or false , it hath made thee propn of propn .
i will lay trust upon thee , and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love .
here is better than the open air .
take it thankfully .
i will piece out the comfort with what addition i can .
i will not be long from you .
all the power of his wits have given way to his impatience .
the gods reward your kindness !
a king , a king !
no , he ’ s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son , for he ’ s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him .
to have a thousand with red burning spits come hissing in upon 'em !
the foul fiend bites my back .
it shall be done .
the foul fiend haunts propn propn in the voice of a nightingale .
hoppedance cries in propn ’ s belly for two white herring .
croak not , black angel .
i have no food for thee .
sit you too .
let us deal justly .
i here take my oath before this honorable assembly , she kicked the poor king her father .
come hither , mistress .
is your name propn ?
she can not deny it .
and here ’ s another , whose warped looks proclaim what store her heart is made on .
stop her there !
arms , arms , sword , fire , corruption in the place !
false justicer , why hast thou let her ’ scape ?
they ’ ll mar my counterfeiting .
the little dogs and all , propn , propn , and propn — see , they bark at me .
propn will throw his head at them .— propn , you curs !
tooth that poisons if it bite , propn , greyhound , mongrel grim ,
hound or spaniel , brach or him , propn tyke or trundle - propn propn will make them weep and wail .
for with throwing thus my head , propn leap the hatch , and all are fled .
be thy mouth or black or white , do - de , propn - propn .
cessez !
come , march to wakes and fairs and market towns .
propn propn , thy horn is dry .
is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts ?
now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile .
make no noise , make no noise .
draw the curtains — so , so , so .
we ’ ll go to supper i ' th ' morning .
so , so , so .
and i ’ ll go to bed at noon .
here , sir , but trouble him not .
his wits are gone .
good friend , i prithee , take him in thy arms .
there is a litter ready .
come , help to bear thy master .
come , come , away .
when we our betters see bearing our woes , we scarcely think our miseries our foes .
who alone suffers , suffers most i ' th ' mind , leaving free things and happy shows behind .
but then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship .
propn , away !
what will hap more tonight , safe ’ scape the king !
propn , lurk .
hang him instantly .
propn out his eyes .
leave him to my displeasure .— edmund , keep you our sister company .
the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding .
advise the duke where you are going , to a most festinate preparation .
we are bound to the like .
our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us .— propn , dear sister .
how now ?
where ’ s the king ?
my lord of propn hath conveyed him hence .
some five or six and thirty of his knights , hot questrists after him , met him at gate , who with some other of the lord ’ s dependants are gone with him towards propn , where they boast to have well - armèd friends .
get horses for your mistress .
propn , sweet lord , and sister .
edmund , farewell .
go seek the traitor propn .
propn him like a thief , bring him before us .
ingrateful fox , ’ tis he .
bind fast his corky arms .
what mean your graces ?
good my friends , consider you are my guests .
do me no foul play , friends .
bind him , i say .
most royal majesty , i crave no more than hath your highness offered .
nor will you tender less .
propn , there she stands .
i know no answer .
propn , will you , with those infirmities she owes— unfriended , new adopted to our hate , dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath— take her or leave her ?
then leave her , sir , for by the power that made me , i tell you all her wealth .
hard , hard .— o filthy traitor !
unmerciful lady as you are , i ’ m none .
to this chair bind him .— propn , thou shalt find— by the kind gods , ’ tis most ignobly done to pluck me by the beard .
so white , and such a traitor ?
naughty lady , these hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin will quicken and accuse thee .
i am your host .
with robbers ' hands my hospitable favors you should not ruffle thus .
what will you do ?
come , sir , what letters had you late from propn ?
be simple - answered , for we know the truth .
and what confederacy have you with the traitors late footed in the kingdom ?
to whose hands you have sent the lunatic king .
speak .
i have a letter guessingly set down , which came from one that ’ s of a neutral heart , and not from one opposed .
cunning .
and false .
where hast thou sent the king ?
to propn .
wherefore to propn ?
wast thou not charged at propn propn to propn ? — let him first answer that .
i am tied to th ' stake , and i must stand the course .
wherefore to propn , sir ?
because i would not see thy cruèl nails propn out his poor old eyes , nor thy fierce sister in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs .
the sea , with such a storm as his bare head in hell - black night endured , would have buoyed up , and quenched the stellèd fires .
yet poor old heart , he holp the heavens to rain .
if wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time , thou shouldst have said , “ good porter , turn the key , ” all cruèls else subscribed .
but i shall see the wingèd vengeance overtake such children .
see ” ’ t shalt thou never .— fellows , hold the chair.— upon these eyes of thine i ’ ll set my foot .
he that will think to live till he be old , give me some help !
o cruel !
o you gods !
one side will mock another — th ' other too .
but better service have i never done you than now to bid you hold .
how now , you dog ?
if you did wear a beard upon your chin , i ’ d shake it on this quarrel .
what do you mean ?
nay then , come on , and take the chance of anger .
oh , i am slain ! —my lord , you have one eye left to see some mischief on him .
oh !
where is thy luster now ?
where ’ s my son propn ?
out , treacherous villain !
thou call ’ st on him that hates thee .
it was he that made the overture of thy treasons to us , who is too good to pity thee .
o my follies !
then propn was abused .
go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell his way to propn .
i have received a hurt .
follow me , lady.— turn out that eyeless villain .
throw this slave upon the dunghill .— propn , i bleed apace .
untimely comes this hurt .
give me your arm .
i ’ ll never care what wickedness i do , if this man come to good .
if she live long , and in the end meet the old course of death , propn will all turn monsters .
let ’ s follow the old earl , and get the propn to lead him where he would .
his roguish madness allows itself to any thing .
go thou .
i ’ ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to apply to his bleeding face .
now propn help him !
the lamentable change is from the best ; the worst returns to laughter .
welcome , then , thou unsubstantial air that i embrace !
but who comes here ?
my father , poorly led ?
world , world , o world !
but that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , propn would not yield to age .
i have been your tenant and your father ’ s tenant these fourscore years .
away , get thee away .
good friend , be gone .
propn , sir , you can not see your way .
i have no way , and therefore want no eyes .
i stumbled when i saw .
full oft ’ tis seen , our means secure us and our mere defects prove our commodities .
o dear son propn , the food of thy abusèd father ’ s wrath , might i but live to see thee in my touch , i ’ d say i had eyes again !
how now ?
who ’ s there ?
madman and beggar too .
my son came then into my mind , and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him .
i have heard more since .
is that the naked fellow ?
ay , my lord .
propn , sir , he is mad .
propn the time ’ s plague when madmen lead the blind .
do as i bid thee .
or rather , do thy pleasure .
propn , naked fellow— propn propn propn a - cold .
come hither , fellow .
propn thou the way to propn ?
propn propn hath been scared out of his good wits .
so bless thee , master .
ay , master .
there is a cliff , whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confinèd deep .
bring me but to the very brim of it , and i ’ ll repair the misery thou dost bear with something rich about me .
from that place i shall no leading need .
give me thy arm .
propn propn shall lead thee .
welcome , my lord .
i marvel our mild husband not met us on the way .
now , where ’ s your master ?
sure , her offense must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it ( or your fore - vouched affection propn into taint ) , which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle could never plant in me .
go to , go to .
better thou propn not been born than not t ' have pleased me better .
is it no more but this — a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do ? — my lord of propn , what say you to the lady ?
love ’ s not love when it is mingled with regards that stands propn from th ' entire point .
will you have her ?
she is herself a dowry .
yours in the ranks of death .
my most dear propn !
oh , the difference of man and man !
to thee a woman ’ s services are due .
my fool usurps my body .
propn , here comes my lord .
i have been worth the whistle .
o propn , you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face .
i fear your disposition .
that nature , which contemns its origin can not be bordered certain in itself .
she that herself will sliver and disbranch from her material sap perforce must wither and come to deadly use .
no more .
the text is foolish .
wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile .
filths savor but themselves .
what have you done ?
tigers , not daughters , what have you performed ?
could my good brother suffer you to do it— a man , a prince by him so benefited ?
where ’ s thy drum ?
thou changèd and self - covered thing , for shame !
bemonster not thy feature .
were propn my fitness to let these hands obey my blood , they are apt enough to dislocate and tear propn flesh and bones .
howe'er thou art a fiend , a woman ’ s shape doth shield thee .
marry , your manhood , mew !
what news ?
propn ’ s eyes ?
but oh , poor propn lost he his other eye ?
both , both , my lord.— this letter , madam , craves a speedy answer .
propn from your sister .
one way i like this well .
but being widow , and my propn with her , may all the building in my fancy pluck upon my hateful life .
come with my lady hither .
he is not here .
no , my good lord .
ay , my good lord .
twas he informed against him , and quit the house on purpose that their punishment might have the freer course .
tell me what more thou know ’ st .
why the propn of propn is so suddenly gone back know you the reason ?
something he left imperfect in the state which , since his coming forth , is thought of ; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary .
who hath he left behind him general ?
the propn of propn , propn propn propn .
did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
ay , sir .
it seemed she was a queen over her passion , who , most rebel - like , sought to be king o'er her .
o , then it moved her ?
in brief , propn would be a rarity most beloved if all could so become it .
made she no verbal question ?
faith , once or twice she heaved the name of “ father ” pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart , propn , “ propn , sisters !
shame of ladies , sisters !
propn , father , sisters !
what , i ' th ' storm , i ' th ' night ?
let pity not be believed . ” there she shook the holy water from her heavenly eyes , and clamor moistened .
then away she started to deal with grief alone .
you spoke not with her since ?
no .
was this before the king returned ?
no , since .
why , good sir ?
a sovereign shame so elbows him .
his own unkindness that stripped her from his benediction turned her to foreign casualties , gave her dear rights to his dog - hearted daughters .
these things sting his mind so venomously that burning shame detains him from propn .
alack , poor gentleman !
of propn ’ s and propn ’ s powers you heard not ?
propn so .
they are afoot .
well , sir , i ’ ll bring you to our master propn and leave you to attend him .
some dear cause will in concealment wrap me up awhile .
when i am known aright you shall not grieve lending me this acquaintance .
i pray you , go along with me .
propn , ’ tis he .
why , he was met even now as mad as the vexed sea , singing aloud , crowned with rank fumiter and furrow - weeds , with burdocks , hemlock , nettles , cuckoo - flowers , propn , and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn .— a century send forth .
search every acre in the high - grown field , and bring him to our eye .
there is means , madam .
our foster nurse of nature is repose , the which he lacks — that to provoke in him are many simples operative , whose power will close the eye of anguish .
all blessed secrets , all you unpublished virtues of the earth , spring with my tears .
be aidant and remediate in the good man ’ s distress .
seek , seek for him , lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it .
news , madam .
the british powers are marching hitherward .
propn known before .
our preparation stands in expectation of them .
o dear father , it is thy business that i go about .
therefore great propn my mourning and importuned tears hath pitied .
no blown ambition doth our arms incite , but love — dear love ! —and our aged father ’ s right .
soon may i hear and see him .
but are my brother ’ s powers set forth ?
ay , madam .
himself in person there ?
propn , with much ado .
your sister is the better soldier .
propn propn spake not with your lord at home ?
no , madam .
what might import my sister ’ s letter to him ?
i know not , lady .
faith , he is posted hence on serious matter .
it was great ignorance , propn ’ s eyes being out , to let him live .
where he arrives he moves all hearts against us .
edmund i think is gone in pity of his misery to dispatch his nighted life ; moreover to descry the strength o ' th ' enemy .
i must needs after him , madam , with my letter .
our troops set forth tomorrow .
stay with us .
the ways are dangerous .
peace be with propn .
since that respects and fortunes are his love , i shall not be his wife .
thee and thy virtues here i seize upon , be it lawful i take up what ’ s cast away .
not all the dukes of waterish propn can buy this unprized precious maid of me.— bid them farewell , propn , though unkind .
let her be thine , for we have no such daughter , nor shall ever see that face of hers again .
bid farewell to your sisters .
i may not , madam .
my lady charged my duty in this business .
why should she write to propn ?
propn some things — i know not what .
propn , i had rather— i know your lady does not love her husband .
i am sure of that .
and at her late being here she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks to noble edmund .
i know you are of her bosom .
i , madam ?
i speak in understanding .
therefore i do advise you , take this note .
my lord is dead .
edmund and i have talked , and more convenient is he for my hand than for your lady propn .
you may gather more .
fare thee well .
when shall we come to th ' top of that same hill ?
methinks the ground is even .
horrible steep .
no , truly .
why then , your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes ' anguish .
so may it be indeed .
methinks thy voice is altered , and thou speak ’ st in better phrase and matter than thou didst .
you ’ re much deceived .
in nothing am i changed but in my garments .
methinks you ’ re better spoken .
come on , sir .
here ’ s the place .
stand still .
how fearful and dizzy ’ tis to cast one ’ s eyes so low !
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air propn scarce so gross as beetles .
halfway down propn one that gathers samphire — dreadful trade !
and yon tall anchoring bark ,
the murmuring surge that on th ' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes can not be heard so high .
set me where you stand .
give me your hand .
you are now within a foot of th ' extreme verge .
let go my hand .
now fare you well , good sir .
with all my heart .
o you mighty gods , this world i do renounce , and in your sights shake patiently my great affliction off .
gone , sir .
propn .
away , and let me die .
ten masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell .
thy life ’ s a miracle .
speak yet again .
but have i fall'n , or no ?
from the dread summit of this chalky bourn .
look up a - height .
the shrill - gorged lark so far can not be seen or heard .
do but look up .
twas yet some comfort when misery could beguile the tyrant ’ s rage and frustrate his proud will .
give me your arm .
up so .
how is propn ?
feel you your legs ?
you stand .
too well , too well .
this is above all strangeness .
upon the crown o ' th ' cliff , what thing was that which parted from you ?
a poor unfortunate beggar .
as i stood here below , methought his eyes were two full moons .
he had a thousand noses , horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea .
it was some fiend .
i do remember now .
henceforth i ’ ll bear affliction till it do cry out itself , “ enough , enough , ” and die .
that thing you speak of , i took it for a man .
propn free and patient thoughts .
but who comes here ?
i am the king himself .
look , look , a mouse !
peace , this piece of toasted cheese will do propn .
o , well flown , bird .
i ' th ' clout , i ' th ' clout .
sweet marjoram .
pass .
i know that voice .
ha !
goneril with a white beard ?
go to , they are not men o ' their words .
they told me i was everything .
the trick of that voice i do well remember .
is propn not the king ?
ay , every inch a king .
i pardon that man ’ s life .
what was thy cause ?
adultery ?
thou shalt not die .
die for adultery ?
no .
the wren goes to propn , and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight .
let copulation thrive , for propn ’ s bastard son was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’ tween the lawful sheets .
to propn , luxury , pell - mell — for i lack soldiers .
down from the waist they are centaurs , though women all above .
there ’ s hell , there ’ s darkness , there ’ s the sulfurous pit— burning , scalding , stench , consumption !
propn , fie , fie , pah , pah ! —give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination .
there ’ s money for thee .
o , let me kiss that hand !
let me wipe it first .
i remember thine eyes well enough .
dost thou squiny at me ?
read thou this challenge .
read .
what , with the case of eyes ?
oh ho , are you there with me ?
no eyes in your head , nor no money in your purse ?
what , art mad ?
a man may see how this world goes with no eyes .
look with thine ears .
see how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief .
thou hast seen a farmer ’ s dog bark at a beggar ?
ay , sir .
and the creature run from the cur ?
there thou mightst behold the great image of authority : a dog ’ s obeyed in office .
thou rascal beadle , hold thy bloody hand .
why dost thou lash that whore ?
thou hotly lust ’ st to use her in that kind for which thou whipp ’ st her .
the usurer hangs the cozener .
none does offend — none , i say , none .
i ’ ll able 'em .
take that of me , my friend , who have the power to seal th ' accuser ’ s lips .
harder , harder .
so .
if thou wilt weep my fortunes , take my eyes .
i know thee well enough .
thy name is propn .
propn must be patient .
we came crying hither .
thou know ’ st the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry .
i will preach to thee .
mark me .
alack , alack the day !
when we are born , we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools .
this a good block .
it were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt .
i ’ ll put propn in proof .
and when i have stol'n upon these sons - in - law , then , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
what , a prisoner ?
i am even the natural fool of fortune .
use me well .
you shall have ransom .
let me have surgeons .
i am cut to th ' brains .
you shall have anything .
no seconds ?
all myself ?
why , this would make a man a man of salt , to use his eyes for garden water - pots , ay , and laying autumn ’ s dust .
good sir—
i will die bravely , like a smug bridegroom .
what , i will be jovial .
come , come .
i am a king , my masters , know you that ?
you are a royal one , and we obey you .
then there ’ s life in propn .
a sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , past speaking of in a king .
propn , gentle sir .
propn , speed you .
what ’ s your will ?
do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward ?
most sure and vulgar .
everyone hears that that can distinguish sound .
but , by your favor , how near ’ s the other army ?
near and on speedy foot .
the main descry stands in the hourly thought .
i thank you , sir .
that ’ s all .
i know you what you are , and like a sister am most loath to call your faults as they are named .
but yet , alas , stood i within his grace , i would prefer him to a better place .
so farewell to you both .
prescribe not us our duty .
propn shall unfold what plighted cunning hides , who covers faults at last with shame derides .
well may you prosper .
come , my fair propn .
sister , it is not a little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both .
i think our father will hence tonight .
that ’ s most certain , and with you .
next month with us .
you see how full of changes his age is .
he always loved our sister most , and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly .
though that the queen on special cause is here , her army is moved on .
i thank you , sir .
you ever gentle gods , take my breath from me .
let not my worser spirit tempt me again to die before you please .
well pray you , father .
now , good sir , what are you ?
a most poor man made tame to fortune ’ s blows , who by the art of known and feeling sorrows am pregnant to good pity .
hearty thanks .
the bounty and the benison of propn to boot and boot .
most happy !
that eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh to raise my fortunes .
thou old unhappy traitor , propn thyself remember .
now let thy friendly hand propn strength enough to propn .
wherefore , bold peasant , propn thou support a published traitor ?
hence , lest that th ' infection of his fortune take like hold on thee .
let go his arm .
propn not let go , zir , without vurther ' casion .
let go , slave , or thou diest !
propn pick your teeth , zir .
come , no matter vor your foins .
if ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body .
i know thee well — a serviceable villain , as duteous to the vices of thy mistress as badness would desire .
what , is he dead ?
let ’ s see these pockets .
the letters that he speaks of may be my friends .
he ’ s dead .
i am only sorry he had no other death ’ s - man .
let us see .
leave , gentle wax , and , manners , blame us not .
their papers is more lawful .
let our reciprocal vows be remembered .
the king is mad .
better i were distract— so should my thoughts be severed from my griefs , and woes by wrong imaginations lose the knowledge of themselves .
give me your hand .
far off methinks i hear the beaten drum .
come , father , i ’ ll bestow you with a friend .
o thou good propn , how shall i live and work to match thy goodness ?
my life will be too short , and every measure fail me .
to be acknowledged , madam , is o'erpaid .
all my reports go with the modest truth , nor more , nor clipped , but so .
be better suited .
i prithee , put them off .
my boon i make it that you know me not till time and i think meet .
then be propn so , my good lord.— how does the king ?
propn , sleeps still .
so please your majesty that we may wake the king ?
he hath slept long .
is he arrayed ?
ay , madam .
be by , good madam , when we do awake him .
i doubt not of his temperance .
very well .
please you , draw near .— louder the music there !
kind and dear princess !
had you not been their father , these white flakes did challenge pity of them .
and wast thou fain , poor father , to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn in short and musty straw ?
alack , alack !
propn wonder that thy life and wits at once had not concluded all .— he wakes .
speak to him .
propn , do you .
propn fittest .
how does my royal lord ?
how fares your majesty ?
you do me wrong to take me out o ' th ' grave .
thou art a soul in bliss , but i am bound upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears do scald like molten lead .
propn , do you know me ?
you are a spirit , i know .
where did you die ?
let him alone awhile .
where have i been ?
where am i ?
fair daylight ?
i am mightily abused .
i should ev'n die with pity to see another thus .
i know not what to say .
i will not swear these are my hands .
let ’ s see .
i feel this pinprick .
would i were assured of my condition .
pray , do not mock me .
i am a very foolish fond old man , propn and upward , not an hour more nor less .
and to deal plainly i fear i am not in my perfect mind .
methinks i should know you , and know this man .
nor i know not where i did lodge last night .
do not laugh at me , for as i am a man , i think this lady to be my child propn .
and so i am , i am .
be your tears wet ?
yes , faith .
i pray , weep not .
if you have poison for me , i will drink it .
you have some cause ; they have not .
no cause , no cause .
am i in propn ?
in your own kingdom , sir .
do not abuse me .
be comforted , good madam .
the great rage , you see , is killed in him .
and yet it is danger to make him even o'er the time he has lost .
desire him to go in .
trouble him no more till further settling .
will propn please your highness walk ?
you must bear with me .
pray you now , forget and forgive .
i am old and foolish .
holds it true , sir , that the propn of propn was so slain ?
most certain , sir .
who is conductor of his people ?
as ’ tis said , the bastard son of propn .
they say propn , his banished son , is with the propn of propn in propn .
propn is changeable .
propn time to look about .
the powers of the kingdom approach apace .
the arbitrament is like to be bloody .
fare you well , sir .
propn to be doubted , madam .
now , sweet lord , you know the goodness i intend upon you .
tell me but truly — but then speak the truth— do you not love my sister ?
in honored love .
i am doubtful that you have been conjunct and bosomed with her as far as we call hers .
no , by mine honor , madam .
propn the infirmity of his age .
yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash .
then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long - engrafted condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them .
such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of propn ’ s banishment .
there is further compliment of leave - taking between propn and him .
pray you , let ’ s sit together .
if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears , this last surrender of his will but offend us .
we shall further think on propn .
we must do something , and i ' th ' heat .
i never shall endure her .
dear my lord , be not familiar with her .
fear me not.— she and the duke her husband !
propn , you speak nobly .
why is this reasoned ?
let ’ s then determine with the ancient of war on our proceedings .
i shall attend you presently at your tent .
sister , you ’ ll go with us ?
no .
propn most convenient .
pray you , go with us .
stay till i have read the letter .
i was forbid it .
when time shall serve , let but the herald cry , and i ’ ll appear again .
why , fare thee well .
i will o'erlook thy paper .
draw up your powers .
we will greet the time .
which of them shall i take ?
both ?
one ?
or neither ?
neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive .
to take the widow propn , makes mad her sister propn , and hardly shall i carry out my side , her husband being alive .
now , then , we ’ ll use his countenance for the battle , which being done , let her who would be rid of him devise his speedy taking off .
if ever i return to you again , i ’ ll bring you comfort .
grace go with you , sir .
away , old man .
give me thy hand .
away !
propn propn hath lost , he and his daughter ta'en .
give me thy hand .
come on .
no further , sir .
come on .
and that ’ s true too .
some officers take them away .
good guard until their greater pleasures first be known that are to censure them .
no , no , no , no !
come , let ’ s away to prison .
we two alone will sing like birds i ' th ' cage .
when thou dost ask me blessing , i ’ ll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness .
and we ’ ll wear out in a walled prison packs and sects of great ones that ebb and flow by the moon .
take them away .
upon such sacrifices , my propn , the gods themselves throw incense .
have i caught thee ?
he that parts us shall bring a brand from propn and fire us hence like foxes .
propn thine eyes .
the good years shall devour them , flesh and fell , propn they shall make us weep .
we ’ ll see 'em starve first .
come .
come hither , captain .
propn .
i ’ ll do propn , my lord .
about it , and write “ happy ” when thou ’ st done .
propn , i say , instantly , and carry it so as i have set it down .
i can not draw a cart , nor eat dried oats .
if it be man ’ s work , i ’ ll do propn .
i do require them of you , so to use them as we shall find their merits and our safety may equally determine .
with him i sent the queen , my reason all the same , and they are ready propn or at further space t ' appear where you shall hold your session .
the question of propn and her father requires a fitter place .
i hold you but a subject of this war , not as a brother .
that ’ s as we list to grace him .
not so hot .
in his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition .
that were the most if he should husband you .
that eye that told you so looked but asquint .
mean you to enjoy him then ?
nor in thine , lord .
half - blooded fellow , yes .
stay yet .
an interlude !
thou art armed , propn .
let the trumpet sound .
sick , oh , sick !
my sickness grows upon me .
she is not well .
convey her to my tent .
come hither , propn .— let the trumpet propn and read out this .
sound , trumpet !
again !
again !
what are you ?
well then , propn propn , i must have your land .
now , gods , stand up for bastards !
propn banished thus ?
all this done upon the gad ? — edmund , how now ?
what news ?
o , know , my name is lost .
yet am i noble as the adversary i come to cope withal .
which is that adversary ?
what ’ s he that speaks for propn , propn of propn ?
himself .
what sayst thou to him ?
behold : it is the privilege of mine honors , my oath , and my profession .
in wisdom i should ask thy name .
back do i toss these treasons to thy head , with the hell - hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—
this is practice , propn .
by th ' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer an unknown opposite .
the laws are mine , not thine .
who can arraign me for propn ?
most monstrous , oh !
ask me not what i know .
go after her .
she ’ s desperate .
what you have charged me with , that have i done— and more , much more .
the time will bring it out .
propn past , and so am i .
i am no less in blood than thou art , propn .
if more , the more thou ’ st wronged me .
my name is propn , and thy father ’ s son .
the gods are just , and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us .
propn spoken right .
propn true .
i must embrace thee .
let sorrow split my heart if ever i did hate thee or thy father .
worthy prince , i know propn .
where have you hid yourself ?
how have you known the miseries of your father ?
list a brief tale , and when ’ tis told , oh , that my heart would burst !
the bloody proclamation to escape , that followed me so near — o our lives ' sweetness ,
and in this habit propn i my father with his bleeding rings , their precious stones new lost , became his guide , led him , begged for him , saved him from despair .
never — o fault ! —revealed myself unto him until some half - hour past , when i was armed .
but his flawed heart— propn , too weak the conflict to support— ' propn two extremes of passion , joy and grief , propn smilingly .
this speech of yours hath moved me , and shall perchance do good .
but speak you on .
you look as you had something more to say .
if there be more , more woeful , hold it in .
for i am almost ready to dissolve , hearing of this .
this would have seemed a period to such as love not sorrow , but another to amplify too much would make much more and top extremity .
twice then the trumpets sounded , and there i left him tranced .
but who was this ?
propn , sir , the banished propn , who in disguise followed his enemy king and did him service propn for a slave .
help , help , o , help !
what kind of help ?
speak , man .
what means that bloody knife ?
propn hot , it smokes .
it came even from the heart of — oh , she ’ s dead !
who dead ?
speak , man .
your lady , sir , your lady .
and her sister by her is poisoned .
she confesses it .
i was contracted to them both .
all three now marry in an instant .
here comes propn .
i thought the king had more affected the propn of propn than propn .
it did always seem so to us .
but now in the division of the kingdom , it appears not which of the dukes he values most , for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either ’ s moiety .
his breeding , sir , hath been at my charge .
i have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now i am brazed to it .
do you smell a fault ?
i can not wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper .
but i have , sir , a son by order of law , some year older than this , who yet is no dearer in my account .
oh , is this he ?
i am come to bid my king and master aye good night .
is he not here ?
great thing of us propn speak , propn , where ’ s the king ?
and where propn propn propn thou this object , propn ?
propn , why thus ?
yet propn was beloved .
the one the other poisoned for my sake , and after slew herself .
even so .— cover their faces .
i pant for life .
some good i mean to do despite of mine own nature .
quickly send— be brief in it — to th ' castle , for my writ is on the life of propn and on propn .
nay , send in time !
run , run , o , run !
to who , my lord ? — who hath the office ?
send propn token of reprieve .
well thought on .
take my sword .
the captain— give it the captain .
haste thee for thy life .
he hath commission from thy wife and me to hang propn in the prison and to lay the blame upon her own despair , that she fordid herself .
the gods defend her ! —hear him hence awhile .
propn , howl , howl , howl !
oh , you are men of stones .
had i your tongues and eyes , i ’ d use them so that propn ’ s vault should crack .
she ’ s gone forever .
i know when one is dead and when one lives .
she ’ s dead as earth .
lend me a looking - glass .
if that her breath will mist or stain the stone , why then , she lives .
or image of that horror ?
fall and cease .
this feather stirs .
she lives .
if it be so , it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows that ever i have felt .
o my good master !
prithee , away .
propn noble propn , your friend .
a plague upon you , murderers , traitors all !
i might have saved her .
now she ’ s gone for propn propn , propn , stay a little .
ha ?
propn true , my lords , he did .
did i not , fellow ?
i am old now , and these same crosses spoil me .
this a dull sight .
are you not propn ?
the same .
your servant propn .
where is your servant propn ?
he ’ s a good fellow , i can tell you that .
he ’ s dead and rotten .
no , my good lord .
i am the very man— i ’ ll see that straight .
that from your first of difference and decay have followed your sad steps .
you ’ re welcome hither .
nor no man else .
all ’ s cheerless , dark , and deadly .
your eldest daughters have fordone themselves , and desperately are dead .
ay , so i think .
he knows not what he says , and vain it is that we present us to him .
edmund is dead , my lord .
for us , we will resign during the life of this old majesty to him our absolute power .
he faints ! —my lord , my lord !
vex not his ghost .
o , let him pass .
oh , he is gone indeed .
the wonder is he hath endured so long .
bear them from hence .
our present business is to general woe .
why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ?
i know no news , my lord .
what paper were you reading ?
nothing , my lord .
no ?
what needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ?
the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself .
i beseech you , sir , pardon me .
it is a letter from my brother that i have not all o'er - read .
give me the letter , sir .
i shall offend , either to detain or give it .
the contents , as in part i understand them , are to blame .
i hope , for my brother ’ s justification , he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue .
i have a journey , sir , shortly to go .
my master calls me .
i must not say no .
the weight of this sad time we must obey .
speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
come to me , that of this i may speak more .
if our father would sleep till i waked him , you should enjoy half his revenue forever , and live the beloved of your brother , propn . ” propn , conspiracy ?
had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in ?
when came this to you ?
who brought it ?
it was not brought me , my lord .
there ’ s the cunning of it .
i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
you know the character to be your brother ’ s ?
if the matter were good , my lord , i durst swear it were his .
but in respect of that , i would fain think it were not .
it is his .
it is his hand , my lord , but i hope his heart is not in the contents .
has he never before sounded you in this business ?
never , my lord .
but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that , sons at perfect age and fathers declined , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue .
o villain , villain !
his very opinion in the letter !
abhorred villain !
go , sirrah , seek him .
i ’ ll apprehend him .
abominable villain !
where is he ?
i do not well know , my lord .
i dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger .
think you so ?
he can not be such a monster— nor is not , sure .
to his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him .
propn and earth !
edmund , seek him out , wind me into him , i pray you .
i will seek him , sir , presently , convey the business as i shall find means , and acquaint you withal .
these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us .
though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects .
love cools , friendship falls off , brothers divide , in cities
mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked ’ twixt son and father .
this villain of mine comes under the prediction — there ’ s son against father .
the king falls from bias of nature — there ’ s father against child .
we have seen the best of our time .
machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves .
find out this villain , propn .
it shall lose thee nothing .
do it carefully .— and the noble and true - hearted propn banished , his offense honesty !
propn strange , strange .
this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune — often the surfeit of our own behavior — we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if we were villains by necessity , fools by heavenly compulsion , knaves , thieves , and treachers by spherical predominance , drunkards , liars , and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence , and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting - on .
my father compounded with my mother under the dragon ’ s tail and my nativity was under propn propn , so that it follows i am rough and lecherous .
fut , i should have been that i am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing .
fa , sol , la , mi .
how now , brother propn ?
what serious contemplation are you in ?
how long have you been a sectary astronomical ?
come , come .
when saw you my father last ?
why , the night gone by .
spake you with him ?
ay , two hours together .
parted you in good terms ?
found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ?
none at all .
some villain hath done me wrong .
that ’ s my fear .
i pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower .
and as i say , retire with me to my lodging , from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak .
pray ye , go .
there ’ s my key .
if you do stir abroad , go armed .
propn , brother ?
brother , i advise you to the best .
go armed .
pray you , away .
shall i hear from you anon ?
i do serve you in this business .
a credulous father , and a brother noble— whose nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none , on whose foolish honesty my practices ride easy .
i see the business .
let me , if not by birth , have lands by wit .
all with me ’ s meet that i can fashion fit .
did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool ?
ay , madam .
by day and night he wrongs me .
every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds .
i ’ ll not endure it .
his knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us on every trifle .
when he returns from hunting , i will not speak with him .
say i am sick .
if you come slack of former services , you shall do well .
the fault of it i ’ ll answer .
he ’ s coming , madam .
i hear him .
put on what weary negligence you please , you and your fellow servants .
if he distaste it , let him to our sister , whose mind and mine i know in that are one , not to be overruled .
idle old man that still would manage those authorities that he hath given away !
now by my life , old fools are babes again and must be used with checks as flatteries , when they are seen abused .
remember what i have said .
very well , madam .
and let his knights have colder looks among you .
what grows of it , no matter .
advise your fellows so .
i would breed from hence occasions , and i shall , that i may speak .
i ’ ll write straight to my sister to hold my very course .
go , prepare for dinner .
if but as well i other accents borrow , that can my speech diffuse , my good intent may carry through itself to that full issue for which i razed my likeness .
now , banished propn , if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned , so may it come thy master , whom thou lovest , shall find thee full of labors .
let me not stay a jot for dinner .
go get it ready .
a man , sir .
what dost thou profess ?
what wouldst thou with us ?
what art thou ?
a very honest - hearted fellow , and as poor as the king .
if thou beest as poor for a subject as he ’ s for a king , thou'rt poor enough .
what wouldst thou ?
service .
who wouldst thou serve ?
you .
dost thou know me , fellow ?
propn .
what services canst thou do ?
i can keep honest counsel , ride , run , mar a curious tale in telling it , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
that which ordinary men are fit for , i am qualified in .
and the best of me is diligence .
how old art thou ?
not so young , sir , to love a woman for singing , nor so old to dote on her for anything .
i have years on my back forty- eight .
follow me .
thou shalt serve me .
where ’ s my knave , my fool ? — go you , and call my fool hither .
no , my lord .
my services to your lordship .
i must love you and sue to know you better .
propn , i shall study deserving .
he hath been out nine years , and away he shall again .
the king is coming .
attend the lords of propn and propn , propn .
i shall , my lord .
you , you , sirrah , where ’ s my daughter ?
so please you— what says the fellow there ?
call the clotpoll back .
where ’ s my fool , ho ?
i think the world ’ s asleep .
how now ?
where ’ s that mongrel ?
he says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
why came not the slave back to me when i called him .
propn , he answered me in the roundest manner he would not .
he would not ?
my lord , i know not what the matter is , but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wo nt .
there ’ s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also , and your daughter .
ha !
propn thou so ?
i beseech you pardon me , my lord , if i be mistaken — for my duty can not be silent when i think your highness wronged .
thou but rememberest me of mine own conception .
i have perceived a most faint neglect of late , which i have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness .
i will look further into propn .
but where ’ s my fool ?
i have not seen him this two days .
since my young lady ’ s going into propn , sir , the fool hath much pined away .
no more of that .
i have noted it well .
go you and tell my daughter i would speak with her .
go you , call hither my fool .
o you sir , you , come you hither , sir .
who am i , sir ?
you slave , you cur !
i am none of these , my lord .
i beseech your pardon .
i ’ ll not be strucken , my lord .
now , my friendly knave , i thank thee .
let me hire him too .— here ’ s my coxcomb .
how now , my pretty knave ?
how dost thou ?
why , propn ?
why ?
for taking one ’ s part that ’ s out of favor .
nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , thou'lt catch cold shortly .
there , take my coxcomb .
why , this fellow has banished two on ’ s daughters , and did the third a blessing against his will .
if thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb .— how now , nuncle ?
would i had two coxcombs and two daughters .
why , my boy ?
if i gave them all my living , i ’ d keep my coxcombs myself .
there ’ s mine .
beg another of thy daughters .
take heed , sirrah — the whip .
a pestilent gall to me !
propn , i ’ ll teach thee a speech .
do .
mark it , nuncle .
have more than thou showest , speak less than thou knowest , lend less than thou owest , ride more than thou goest , learn more than thou trowest , set less than thou throwest , leave thy drink and thy whore and keep in - a - door , and thou shalt have more than two tens to a score .
this is nothing , propn .
then ’ tis like the breath of an propn lawyer .
why no , boy .
nothing can be made out of nothing .
a bitter fool .
dost thou know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet fool ?
no , lad .
teach me .
that lord that counseled thee to give away thy land , come place him here by me .
do thou for him stand .
the sweet and bitter fool will presently appear— the one in motley here , the other found out there .
dost thou call me fool , boy ?
all thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with .
this is not altogether fool , my lord .
no , faith , lords and great men will not let me .
what two crowns shall they be ?
why — after i have cut the egg i ' th ' middle and eat up the meat — the two crowns of the egg .
if i speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so .
when were you wo nt to be so full of songs , sirrah ?
i have used it , nuncle , ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers .
for when thou gavest them the rod , and put ’ st down thine own breeches , prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie .
i would fain learn to lie .
an you lie , sirrah , we ’ ll have you whipped .
i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are .
they ’ ll have me whipped for speaking true , thou'lt have me whipped for lying , and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace .
i had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool .
and yet i would not be thee , nuncle .
here comes one o ' the parings .
how now , daughter ?
what makes that frontlet on ?
methinks you are too much of late i ' th ' frown .
he that keeps nor crust nor crumb , propn of all , shall want some .
but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel , breaking forth in rank and not - to - be - endurèd riots .
which else were shame , that then necessity will call discreet proceeding .
for you know , nuncle , the hedge - sparrow fed the cuckoo so long , that it ’ s had it head bit off by it young .
so out went the candle and we were left darkling .
are you our daughter ?
does any here know me ?
why , this is not propn .
where are his eyes ?
sure , ’ tis not so .
who is it that can tell me who i am ?
propn ’ s shadow .
which they will make an obedient father .
this admiration , sir , is much o ' th ' savor of other your new pranks .
i do beseech you to understand my purposes aright .
as you are old and reverend , should be wise .
here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , propn so disordered , so debauched and bold that this our court , infected with their manners , shows like a riotous inn .
epicurism and lust make it more like a tavern or a brothel than a graced palace .
the shame itself doth speak for instant remedy .
darkness and devils !
saddle my horses .
call my train propn propn bastard , i ’ ll not trouble thee .
yet have i left a daughter .
you strike my people , and your disordered rabble make servants of their betters .
woe that too late repents ! — is it your will ?
ingratitude , thou marble - hearted fiend , more hideous when thou show ’ st thee in a child than the sea monster .
pray , sir , be patient .
it may be so , my lord .
hear , nature , hear , dear goddess , hear !
dry up in her the organs of increase , and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honor her .
to thine and propn ’ s issue be this perpetual .— what says our second daughter , our dearest propn , wife of propn ?
speak .
now gods that we adore , whereof comes this ?
thou shalt find that i ’ ll resume the shape which thou dost think i have cast off for ever .
thou shalt , i warrant thee .
do you mark that , my lord ?
i can not be so partial , propn , to the great love i bear you— pray you , content .
come , sire , no more .— what , propn , ho !
a fox when one has caught her and such a daughter should sure to the slaughter , if my cap would buy a halter .
so the fool follows after .
this man hath had good counsel — a hundred knights !
well , you may fear too far .
safer than trust too far .
let me still take away the harms i fear , not fear still to be taken .
i know his heart .
what he hath uttered i have writ my sister .
if she sustain him and his hundred knights when i have showed th ' unfitness— here , madam .
how now , propn ?
what , have you writ that letter to my sister ?
ay , madam .
take you some company , and away to horse .
inform her full of my particular fear , and thereto add such reasons of your own as may compact it more .
get you gone and hasten your return .
striving to better , oft we mar what ’ s well .
nay , propn well , well , th ' event .
i will not sleep , my lord , till i have delivered your letter .
if a man ’ s brains were in ’ s heels , were propn not in danger of kibes ?
ay , boy .
ha , ha , ha !
propn see thy other daughter will use thee kindly .
for though she ’ s as like this as a crab ’ s like an apple , yet i can tell what i can tell .
why , what canst thou tell , my boy ?
she will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab .
thou canst tell why one ’ s nose stands i ' th ' middle on ’ s face ?
no .
why , to keep one ’ s eyes of either side ’ s nose , that what a man can not smell out , he may spy into .
i did her wrong— propn tell how an oyster makes his shell ?
no .
nor i neither .
but i can tell why a snail has a house .
why ?
why , to put ’ s head in — not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case .
i will forget my nature .
so kind a father ! —be my horses ready ?
thy asses are gone about 'em .
the reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason .
because they are not eight ?
yes indeed .
thou wouldst make a good fool .
to take propn again perforce— monster ingratitude !
if thou wert my fool , nuncle , i ’ d have thee beaten for being old before thy time .
how ’ s that ?
thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise .
o , let me not be mad , not mad , sweet heaven !
keep me in temper .
i would not be mad .
ready , my lord .
come , boy .
save thee , propn .
and you , sir .
i have been with your father and given him notice that the propn of propn and propn his duchess will be here with him this night .
how comes that ?
nay , i know not .
have you heard of no likely wars toward propn the two propn of propn and propn ?
not a word .
you may do then in time .
fare you well , sir .
the duke be here tonight ?
this weaves itself perforce into my business .
briefness and fortune , propn propn , a word .
descend , brother , i say .
my father watches .
o sir , fly this place .
intelligence is given where you are hid .
have you not spoken ' gainst the propn of propn aught ?
he ’ s coming hither — now , i ' th ' night , i ' th ' haste , and propn with him .
advise yourself .
i hear my father coming .
pardon me .
in cunning i must draw my sword upon you .
now quit you well.— propn , torches !
now propn , where ’ s the villain ?
look , sir , i bleed .
where is the villain , propn ?
fled this way , sir , when by no means he could— propn him , ho !
go after .
by no means ” what ?
propn , in fine , seeing how loathly opposite i stood to his unnatural purpose , in fell motion , with his preparèd sword he charges home my unprovided body , latched mine arm .
and when he saw my best alarumed spirits , propn in the quarrel ’ s right , roused to the encounter , or whether ghasted by the noise i made , full suddenly he fled .
let him fly far .
not in this land shall he remain uncaught .
the noble duke my master , my worthy arch and patron , comes tonight .
and find i am alone felicitate in your dear highness ' love .
speak .
nothing , my lord .
nothing ?
nothing .
nothing will come of nothing .
speak again .
unhappy that i am , i can not heave my heart into my mouth .
i love your majesty according to my bond , no more nor less .
how , how , propn ?
mend your speech a little , lest you may mar your fortunes .
he that conceals him , death .
he replied , “ thou unpossessing bastard !
dost thou think if i would stand against thee , would the reposal of any trust , virtue , or worth in thee make thy words faithed ?
no .
what i should deny— as this i would , ay , though thou didst produce my very character — i ’ d turn it all to thy suggestion , plot , and damnèd practice .
and thou must make a dullard of the world , if they not thought the profits of my death were very pregnant and potential spirits to make thee seek it . ” o strange and fastened villain !
would he deny his letter , said he ?
i never got propn propn , the duke ’ s trumpets .
i know not why he comes .
all ports i ’ ll bar .
the villain shall not ’ scape .
the duke must grant me that .
how now , my noble friend ?
since i came hither , which i can call but now , i have heard strange news .
how dost , my lord ?
o madam , my old heart is cracked , it ’ s cracked .
o , lady , lady , shame would have it hid .
was he not companion with the riotous knights that tend upon my father ?
i know not , madam .
propn too bad , too bad .
yes , madam , he was of that consort .
no marvel then , though he were ill affected .
propn they have put him on the old man ’ s death , to have th ' expense and spoil of his revenues .
i have this present evening from my sister been well informed of them — and with such cautions that if they come to sojourn at my house i ’ ll not be there .
nor i , assure thee , propn propn , i hear that you have shown your father a childlike office .
it was my duty , sir .
he did bewray his practice , and received this hurt you see striving to apprehend him .
is he pursued ?
ay , my good lord .
if he be taken , he shall never more be feared of doing harm .
natures of such deep trust we shall much need .
i shall serve you , sir , propn , however else .
you know not why we came to visit propn thus out of season , threading dark - eyed night .
the several messengers from hence attend dispatch .
our good old friend , propn comforts to your bosom , and bestow your needful counsel to our business , which craves the instant use .
i serve you , madam .
your graces are right welcome .
good dawning to thee , friend .
art of this house ?
ay .
where may we set our horses ?
i ' th ' mire .
prithee , if thou lovest me , tell me .
i love thee not .
why , then , i care not for thee .
if i had thee in propn pinfold , i would make thee care for me .
why dost thou use me thus ?
i know thee not .
propn , i know thee .
what dost thou know me for ?
why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee !
what a brazen - faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me !
is it two days ago since i tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king ?
draw , you rogue , for though it be night yet the moon shines .
i ’ ll make a sop o ' th ' moonshine of you .
away !
i have nothing to do with thee .
draw , you rascal .
you come with letters against the king and take propn the puppet ’ s part against the royalty of her father .
draw , you rogue , or i ’ ll so carbonado your shanks .
draw , you rascal !
come your ways .
help , ho !
murder !
help !
stand , you neat slave , strike !
help , ho !
murder , murder !
propn .
then stand with us .
the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day .
now spurs the lated traveler apace to gain the timely inn , and near approaches the subject of our watch .
then ’ tis he : the rest that are within the note of expectation already are i ' th ' court .
propn he .
stand to propn .
it will be rain tonight .
let it come down .
o treachery !
fly , good propn , fly , fly , fly !
propn may ’ st revenge —o slave !
who did strike out the light ?
was propn not the way ?
there ’ s but one down .
the son is fled .
we have lost best half of our affair .
well , let ’ s away and say how much is done .
at first and last , the hearty welcome .
thanks to your majesty .
ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host .
pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends , for my heart speaks they are welcome .
see , they encounter thee with their hearts ' thanks .
both sides are even .
here i ’ ll sit i ' th ' midst .
be large in mirth .
propn we ’ ll drink a measure the table round .
propn propn propn then .
my lord , his throat is cut .
that i did for him .
thou art the best o ' th ' cutthroats : yet he ’ s good that did the like for propn .
if thou didst it , thou art the nonpareil .
most royal sir , propn is ’ scaped .
then comes my fit again .
i had else been perfect , whole as the marble , founded as the rock , as broad and general as the casing air .
ay , my good lord .
safe in a ditch he bides , with twenty trenchèd gashes on his head , the least a death to nature .
thanks for that .
there the grown serpent lies .
the worm that ’ s fled propn nature that in time will venom breed ; no teeth for th ' present .
get thee gone .
tomorrow we ’ ll hear ourselves again .
my royal lord , you do not give the cheer .
to feed were best at home ; from thence , the sauce to meat is ceremony ; propn were bare without it .
where hast thou been , sister ?
killing swine .
sister , where thou ?
a sailor ’ s wife had chestnuts in her lap , and munched , and munched , and munched .
give me , ” quoth i .
aroint thee , witch ! ” the rump - fed runnion cries .
thou ' rt kind .
and i another .
i ’ ll drain him dry as hay .
sleep shall neither night nor day propn upon his penthouse lid .
he shall live a man forbid .
propn sev'nnights nine times nine propn he dwindle , peak and pine .
sweet remembrancer !
may propn please your highness sit .
his absence , sir , propn blame upon his promise .
please propn your highness to grace us with your royal company ?
the table ’ s full .
here is a place reserved , sir .
where ?
what , my good lord ?
gentlemen , rise .
his highness is not well .
sit , worthy friends .
my lord is often thus and hath been from his youth .
pray you , keep seat .
if much you note him , you shall offend him and extend his passion .
feed and regard him not .
ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that which might appall the devil .
o proper stuff !
this is the very painting of your fear .
this is the air - drawn dagger which you said led you to propn .
oh , these flaws and starts , propn to true fear , would well become a woman ’ s story at a winter ’ s fire , authorized by her grandam .
shame itself !
why do you make such faces ?
when all ’ s done , you look but on a stool .
prithee , see there !
behold !
look !
if i stand here , i saw him .
propn , for shame !
the time has been that , when the brains were out , the man would die , and there an end .
but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools .
this is more strange than such a murder is .
my worthy lord , your noble friends do lack you .
our duties , and the pledge .
approach thou like the rugged russian bear , the armed rhinoceros , or th ' hyrcan tiger ; take any shape but that , and my firm nerves shall never tremble .
or be alive again , and dare me to the desert with thy sword .
if trembling i inhabit then , protest me the baby of a girl .
hence , horrible shadow !
unreal mockery , hence !
why so , being gone , why so , being gone , i am a man again .
pray you sit still .
you have displaced the mirth , broke the good meeting , with most admired disorder .
what sights , my lord ?
i pray you , speak not .
he grows worse and worse .
question enrages him .
at once , good night .
a kind good night to all !
stones have been known to move , and trees to speak .
almost at odds with morning , which is which .
did you send to him , sir ?
i hear it by the way ; but i will send .
there ’ s not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee ’ d .
i will tomorrow— and betimes i will — to the weird sisters .
more shall they speak , for now i am bent to know , by the worst means , the worst .
for mine own good , all causes shall give way .
strange things i have in head , that will to hand , which must be acted ere they may be scanned .
come , we ’ ll to sleep .
my strange and self - abuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use .
we are yet but young in deed .
why , how now , propn !
you look angerly .
have i not reason , beldams as you are ?
but make amends now .
get you gone , and at the pit of propn propn me i ' th ' morning .
thither he will come to know his destiny .
your vessels and your spells provide , your charms and everything beside .
i am for the air .
this night i ’ ll spend unto a dismal and a fatal end .
great business must be wrought ere noon .
upon the corner of the moon there hangs a vap'rous drop profound .
i ’ ll catch it ere it come to ground .
and that distilled by magic sleights shall raise such artificial sprites as by the strength of their illusion shall draw him on to his confusion .
he shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear his hopes ' bove wisdom , grace , and fear .
and you all know , security is mortals ' chiefest enemy .
propn !
i am called .
my little spirit , see , sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me .
only i say things have been strangely borne .
men must not walk too late .
who can not want the thought how monstrous it was for propn and for propn to kill their gracious father ?
all which we pine for now .
and this report propn so exasperated the king that he prepares for some attempt of war .
sent he to propn ?
i ’ ll send my prayers with him .
though his bark can not be lost , yet it shall be tempest - tossed .
look what i have .
show me , show me .
a drum , a drum !
propn doth come .
thrice the brinded cat hath mewed .
harpier cries , “ ' propn time , ’ tis time . ” round about the cauldron go , in the poisoned entrails throw .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
cool it with a baboon ’ s blood , then the charm is firm and good .
oh well done !
i commend your pains , and every one shall share i ' th ' gains .
and now about the cauldron sing , like elves and fairies in a ring , enchanting all that you put in .
by the pricking of my thumbs , something wicked this way comes .
open , locks , whoever knocks .
how now , you secret , black , and midnight hags ?
what is propn you do ?
a deed without a name .
i conjure you by that which you profess— propn you come to know it — answer me .
speak .
demand .
we ’ ll answer .
say , if th ' hadst rather hear it from our mouths , or from our masters ' .
call 'em .
let me see 'em .
pour in sow ’ s blood , that hath eaten her nine farrow ; grease that ’ s sweaten from the murderer ’ s gibbet throw into the flame .
tell me , thou unknown power— he knows thy thought .
hear his speech but say thou nought .
propn !
propn !
propn !
beware propn .
beware the thane of propn .
dismiss me .
enough .
propn thou art , for thy good caution , thanks .
thou hast harped my fear aright .
but one word more— he will not be commanded .
here ’ s another more potent than the first .
propn !
propn had i three ears , i ’ d hear thee .
be bloody , bold , and resolute .
laugh to scorn the power of man , for none of woman born propn harm propn .
but yet i ’ ll make assurance double sure , and take a bond of fate .
thou shalt not live , that i may tell pale - hearted fear it lies , and sleep in spite of thunder .
what is this that rises like the issue of a king , and wears upon his baby - brow the round and top of sovereignty ?
listen but speak not to propn .
be lion - mettled , proud , and take no care who chafes , who frets , or where conspirers are .
propn shall never vanquished be until propn propn propn to high propn propn shall come against him .
that will never be .
who can impress the forest , bid the tree propn his earthbound root ?
sweet bodements !
good !
rebellious dead , rise never till the wood of propn rise , and our high - placed propn shall live the lease of nature , pay his breath to time and mortal custom .
yet my heart propn to know one thing .
tell me , if your art can tell so much : shall propn ’ s issue ever propn in this kingdom ?
seek to know no more .
i will be satisfied .
deny me this , and an eternal curse fall on you !
let me know .
why sinks that cauldron ?
and what noise is this ?
show .
show .
show .
show his eyes and grieve his heart .
come like shadows ; so depart !
thou art too like the spirit of propn .
i ’ ll see no more .
horrible sight !
what , is this so ?
come , sisters , cheer we up his sprites , and show the best of our delights .
where are they ?
gone ?
let this pernicious hour stand aye accursèd in the calendar !
what ’ s your grace propn will ?
saw you the weird sisters ?
no , my lord .
came they not by you ?
no , indeed , my lord .
i did hear the galloping of horse .
who was propn came by ?
propn two or three , my lord , that bring you word propn is fled to propn .
fled to propn ?
ay , my good lord .
propn , thou anticipat ’ st my dread exploits .
no boasting like a fool .
this deed i ’ ll do before this purpose cool .
but no more sights ! —where are these gentlemen ?
come , bring me where they are .
what had he done to make him fly the land ?
you must have patience , madam .
he had none .
his flight was madness .
when our actions do not , our fears do make us traitors .
you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
wisdom !
to leave his wife , to leave his babes , his mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly ?
for the poor wren , the most diminutive of birds , will fight , her young ones in her nest , against the owl .
all is the fear and nothing is the love , as little is the wisdom , where the flight so runs against all reason .
my dearest coz , i pray you school yourself .
but for your husband , he is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows the fits o ' th ' season .
i take my leave of you .
shall not be long but i ’ ll be here again .
things at the worst will cease , or else climb upward to what they were before .— my pretty cousin , blessing upon you .
propn he is , and yet he ’ s fatherless .
i am so much a fool , should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort .
i take my leave at once .
propn , your father ’ s dead .
and what will you do now ?
how will you live ?
as birds do , propn .
what , with worms and flies ?
with what i get , i mean , and so do they .
poor bird !
thou ’ dst never fear the net nor lime , the pitfall nor the gin .
my father is not dead , for all your saying .
yes , he is dead .
how wilt thou do for a father ?
nay , how will you do for a husband ?
why , i can buy me twenty at any market .
speak , if you can : what are you ?
all hail , propn !
hail to thee , thane of propn !
all hail , propn !
propn !
propn !
propn !
lesser than propn and greater .
not so happy , yet much happier .
thou shalt get kings , though thou be none .
so all hail , propn and propn !
then you ’ ll buy 'em to sell again .
thou speak ’ st with all thy wit ; and yet , i ' faith , with wit enough for thee .
was my father a traitor , propn ?
ay , that he was .
what is a traitor ?
why , one that swears and lies .
and be all traitors that do so ?
every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged .
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
every one .
who must hang them ?
why , the honest men .
then the liars and swearers are fools , for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them .
if he were dead , you ’ d weep for him .
if you would not , it were a good sign that i should quickly have a new father .
poor prattler , how thou talk ’ st !
bless you , fair dame !
i am not to you known , though in your state of honor i am perfect .
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly .
if you will take a homely man ’ s advice , be not found here .
hence with your little ones .
to fright you thus methinks i am too savage ; to do worse to you were fell cruelty , which is too nigh your person .
propn preserve you !
i dare abide no longer .
propn should i fly ?
i have done no harm .
but i remember now i am in this earthly world , where to do harm is often laudable , to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly .
why then , alas , do i put up that womanly defense , to say i have done no harm ?
what are these faces ?
where is your husband ?
i hope , in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him .
he ’ s a traitor .
thou liest , thou shag - haired villain !
young fry of treachery !
he has killed me , mother .
run away , i pray you !
let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty .
let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and , like good men , bestride our downfall'n birthdom .
each new morn propn widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows strike heaven on the face , that it resounds as if it felt with propn and yelled out like syllable of dolor .
what you have spoke , it may be so perchance .
this tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , was once thought honest .
you have loved him well .
he hath not touched you yet .
i am young , but something you may deserve of him through me , and wisdom to offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb propn ' appease an angry god .
i am not treacherous .
but propn is .
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge .
but i shall crave your pardon .
that which you are , my thoughts can not transpose .
angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , yet grace must still look so .
why in that rawness left you wife and child , those precious motives , those strong knots of love , without leave - taking ?
i pray you , let not my jealousies be your dishonors , but mine own safeties .
you may be rightly just , whatever i shall think .
propn , bleed , poor country !
i would not be the villain that thou think ’ st for the whole space that ’ s in the tyrant ’ s grasp , and the rich propn to boot .
be not offended .
i speak not as in absolute fear of you .
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke .
it weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash is added to her wounds .
i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right ; and here from gracious propn have i offer of goodly thousands .
what should he be ?
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top propn .
i grant him bloody , luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin that has a name .
but there ’ s no bottom , none , in my voluptuousness .
your wives , your daughters , your matrons , and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust , and my desire all continent impediments would o'erbear that did oppose my will .
propn propn than such an one to reign .
boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny .
it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings .
but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours .
we have willing dames enough .
this avarice sticks deeper , grows with more pernicious root than summer - seeming lust , and it hath been the sword of our slain kings .
but i have none .
nay , had i power , i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell , propn the universal peace , confound all unity on earth .
o propn , propn !
if such a one be fit to govern , speak .
fare thee well !
propn indeed , before thy here - approach , propn propn , with ten thousand warlike men , already at a point , was setting forth .
why are you silent ?
such welcome and unwelcome things at once ' propn hard to reconcile .
well , more anon .— comes the king forth , i pray you ?
ay , sir ; there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure .
their malady convinces the great assay of art , but at his touch— such sanctity hath propn given his hand— they presently amend .
i thank you , doctor .
what ’ s the disease he means ?
propn called the evil .
a most miraculous work in this good king , which often since my here - remain in propn i have seen him do .
with this strange virtue , he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy , and sundry blessings hang about his throne , that speak him full of grace .
see , who comes here ?
my countryman , but yet i know him not .
my ever - gentle cousin , welcome hither .
propn , amen .
propn propn where it did ?
alas , poor country !
almost afraid to know itself .
oh , relation too nice and yet too true !
propn and propn , all hail !
stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more .
say from whence you owe this strange intelligence , or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting .
speak , i charge you .
the earth hath bubbles , as the water has , and these are of them .
propn are they vanished ?
would they had stayed .
were such things here as we do speak about ?
or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner ?
your children shall be kings .
you shall be king .
and thane of propn too : went it not so ?
to the selfsame tune and words .
who ’ s here ?
how does my wife ?
why , well .
and all my children ?
well too .
how goes propn ?
now is the time of help .
propn propn hath propn us good propn and ten thousand men ; an older and a better soldier none that propn gives out .
would i could answer this comfort with the like .
what concern they ?
if it be mine , keep it not from me .
quickly let me have it .
i guess at it .
your castle is surprised , your wife and babes savagely slaughtered .
merciful heaven !
my children too ?
wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
and i must be from thence !
my wife killed too ?
i have said .
let ’ s make us med'cines of our great revenge , to cure this deadly grief .
he has no children .
all my pretty ones ?
did you say all ?
o hell - kite !
all ?
what , all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop ?
dispute it like a man .
i can not but remember such things were that were most precious to me .
did propn look on , and would not take their part ?
propn propn , they were all struck for thee !
propn that i am , not for their own demerits , but for mine , propn slaughter on their souls .
propn rest them now .
be this the whetstone of your sword .
let grief propn to anger .
oh , i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue !
but , gentle heavens , cut short all intermission .
front to front propn thou this fiend of propn and myself .
within my sword ’ s length set him ; if he ’ scape , propn forgive him too .
this tune goes manly .
come , go we to the king .
our power is ready ; our lack is nothing but our leave .
propn is ripe for shaking , and the powers above put on their instruments .
receive what cheer you may .
i have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report .
when was it she last walked ?
since his majesty went into the field , i have seen her rise from her bed , throw her nightgown upon her , unlock her closet , take forth paper , fold it , write upon propn , read it , afterwards seal it , and again return to bed ; yet all this while in a most fast sleep .
in this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
that , sir , which i will not report after her .
neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
propn you , here she comes .
this is her very guise ; and , upon my life , fast asleep .
observe her , stand close .
how came she by that light ?
why , it stood by her .
she has light by her continually .
propn her command .
you see her eyes are open .
ay , but their sense is shut .
what is it she does now ?
look , how she rubs her hands .
it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands .
yet here ’ s a spot .
propn !
she speaks .
i will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
do you mark that ?
the thane of propn had a wife .
where is she now ? — what , will these hands ne'er be clean ? — no more o ' that , my lord , no more o ' that .
you have known what you should not .
she has spoke what she should not , i am sure of that .
propn knows what she has known .
here ’ s the smell of the blood still .
all the perfumes of propn will not sweeten this little hand .
oh , oh , oh !
what a sigh is there !
the heart is sorely charged .
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
well , well , well .
pray propn it be , sir .
this disease is beyond my practice .
yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
wash your hands .
put on your nightgown .
even so ?
to bed , to bed .
there ’ s knocking at the gate .
will she go now to bed ?
propn , propn forgive us all !
good night , good doctor .
the english power is near , led on by propn , his uncle propn and the good propn .
revenges burn in them , for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm propn the mortified man .
who knows if propn be with his brother ?
for certain , sir , he is not .
i have a file of all the gentry .
what does the tyrant ?
great propn he strongly fortifies .
but , for certain , he can not buckle his distempered cause within the belt of rule .
who then shall blame his pestered senses to recoil and start , when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there ?
make we our march towards propn .
silenced with that , in viewing o'er the rest o ' the selfsame day , he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks , nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , strange images of death .
as thick as tale can post with post , and every one did bear propn praises in his kingdom ’ s great defense , and poured them down before him .
we are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks , only to herald thee into his sight , not pay thee .
why do you dress me in borrowed robes ?
whether he was combined with those of propn , or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage , or that with both he labored in his country ’ s wrack , i know not ; but treasons capital , confessed and proved , have overthrown him .
bring me no more reports .
till propn propn remove to propn i can not taint with fear .
what ’ s the boy propn ?
was he not born of woman ?
the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus : “ fear not , propn .
no man that ’ s born of woman propn e'er have power upon thee . ” then fly , false thanes , and mingle with the english epicures .
the mind i sway by and the heart i bear propn never sag with doubt nor shake with fear .
the devil damn thee black , thou cream - faced loon !
where got ’ st thou that goose look ?
there is ten thousand— propn , villain ?
soldiers , sir .
go , prick thy face and over - red thy fear , thou lily - livered boy .
what soldiers , patch ?
death of thy soul !
those linen cheeks of thine are counselors to fear .
what soldiers , whey - face ?
the english force , so please you .
take thy face hence .
seyton ! —i am sick at heart , when i behold — propn , i say ! —this push will cheer me ever , or disseat me now .
i have lived long enough .
propn !
what ’ s your gracious pleasure ?
what news more ?
all is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
i ’ ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked .
give me my armor .
propn not needed yet .
i ’ ll put it on .
send out more horses .
give me mine armor .
not so sick , my lord , as she is troubled with thick - coming fancies that keep her from her rest .
cure her of that .
therein the patient must minister to himself .
throw physic to the dogs ; i ’ ll none of it .
come , put mine armor on .
ay , my good lord .
your royal preparation makes us hear something .
propn , i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe .
we doubt it nothing .
what wood is this before us ?
the wood of propn .
let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear propn before him .
thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery propn in report of us .
it shall be done .
we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in propn and will endure our setting down before propn .
hang out our banners on the outward walls .
the cry is still “ they come ! ” our castle ’ s strength will laugh a siege to scorn .
here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up .
were they not forced with those that should be ours , we might have met them dareful , beard to beard , and beat them backward home .
what is that noise ?
it is the cry of women , my good lord .
i have almost forgot the taste of fears .
the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night - shriek , and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in propn .
propn was that cry ?
the queen , my lord , is dead .
she should have died hereafter .
tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time , and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death .
out , out , brief candle !
it is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .
gracious my lord , i should report that which i say i saw , but know not how to do propn .
well , say , sir .
as i did stand my watch upon the hill , i looked toward propn , and anon methought the wood began to move .
liar and slave !
let me endure your wrath , if propn be not so .
within this three mile may you see it coming ; i say , a moving grove .
if thou speak ’ st false , upon the next tree shall thou hang alive till famine cling thee .
if thy speech be sooth , i care not if thou dost for me as much .
now near enough .
fare you well .
do we but find the tyrant ’ s power tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .
they have tied me to a stake .
i can not fly , but , bearlike , i must fight the course .
what ’ s he that was not born of woman ?
such a one am i to fear , or none .
what is thy name ?
thou ' lt be afraid to hear it .
no , though thou call ’ st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell .
my name propn propn .
the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear .
no , nor more fearful .
thou liest , abhorrèd tyrant .
but swords i smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , brandished by man that ’ s of a woman born .
but ’ tis strange .
that way the noise is .
propn , show thy face !
either thou , propn , or else my sword with an unbattered edge i sheathe again undeeded .
there thou shouldst be ; by this great clatter , one of the greatest note seems bruited .
this way , my lord .
the castle ’ s gently rendered .
enter , sir , the castle .
turn , hellhound , turn !
but get thee back .
i have no words .
my voice is in my sword .
thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out !
as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed .
let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ; i bear a charmèd life , which must not yield to one of woman born .
i ’ ll not fight with thee .
then yield thee , coward , and live to be the show and gaze o ' th ' time .
we ’ ll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , painted on a pole , and underwrit , “ here may you see the tyrant . ” i will not yield , to kiss the ground before young propn ’ s feet , and to be baited with the rabble ’ s curse .
propn propn propn be come to propn , and thou opposed , being of no woman born , yet i will try the last .
before my body i throw my warlike shield .
lay on , propn , and damned be him that first cries , “ hold , enough ! ” i would the friends we miss were safe arrived .
some must go off .
propn is missing , and your noble son .
your son , my lord , has paid a soldier ’ s debt .
he only lived but till he was a man , the which no sooner had his prowess confirmed in the unshrinking station where he fought , but like a man he died .
then he is dead ?
ay , and brought off the field .
your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth , for then it hath no end .
had he his hurts before ?
ay , on the front .
why then , propn ’ s soldier be he !
had i as many sons as i have hairs , i would not wish them to a fairer death .
and so , his knell is knolled .
he ’ s worth more sorrow , and that i ’ ll spend for him .
he ’ s worth no more .
they say he parted well and paid his score .
and so , propn be with him !
here comes newer comfort .
propn , king !
for so thou art .
propn where stands the usurper ’ s cursèd head .
the time is free .
propn , propn of propn !
my thanes and kinsmen , henceforth be earls , the first that ever propn in such an honor named .
so , thanks to all at once and to each one , whom we invite to see us crowned at propn .
look how our partner ’ s rapt .
propn propn , we stay upon your leisure .
kind gentlemen , your pains are registered where every day i turn the leaf to read them .
let us toward the king .
very gladly .
till then , enough .
my liege , they are not yet come back .
but i have spoke with one that saw him die , who did report that very frankly he confessed his treasons , propn your highness ' pardon , and set forth a deep repentance .
nothing in his life became him like the leaving it .
he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as ’ twere a careless trifle .
there ’ s no art to find the mind ’ s construction in the face .
welcome hither .
so humbly take my leave .
my worthy propn !
when shall we three meet again ?
in thunder , lightning , or in rain ?
that will be ere the set of sun .
where the place ?
there to meet with propn .
what thou wouldst highly , that wouldst thou holily ; wouldst not play false , and yet wouldst wrongly win .
thou'ld ’ st have , great propn , that which cries , “ thus thou must do , ” if thou have it , and that which rather thou dost fear to do , than wishest should be undone .
what is your tidings ?
the king comes here tonight .
thou ' rt mad to say it .
one of my fellows had the speed of him , who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more than would make up his message .
give him tending .
he brings great news .
my dearest love , propn comes here tonight .
and when goes hence ?
tomorrow , as he purposes .
o , never shall sun that morrow see !
your face , my thane , is as a book where men may read strange matters .
propn welcome in your eye , your hand , your tongue .
look like th ' innocent flower , but be the serpent under propn .
we will speak further .
leave all the rest to me .
this castle hath a pleasant seat .
the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses .
this guest of summer , the temple - haunting martlet , does approve , by his loved mansionry , that the propn ’ s breath smells wooingly here .
no jutty , frieze , propn , nor coign of vantage , but this bird propn made his pendant bed and procreant cradle .
where they most breed and haunt , i have observed , the air is delicate .
see , see , our honored hostess !
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble , which still we thank as love .
fair and noble hostess , we are your guest tonight .
your servants ever have theirs , themselves , and what is theirs in compt , to make their audit at your highness ' pleasure , still to return your own .
give me your hand .
conduct me to mine host .
we love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him .
by your leave , hostess .
if it were done when ’ tis done , then ’ twere well it were done quickly .
what news ?
he has almost supped .
why have you left the chamber ?
propn he asked for me ?
know you not he has ?
we will proceed no further in this business .
he hath honored me of late , and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people , which would be worn now in their newest gloss , not cast aside so soon .
was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself ?
from this time such i account thy love .
art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valor as thou art in desire ?
propn thou have that which thou esteem ’ st the ornament of life , and live a coward in thine own esteem , letting “ i dare not ” wait upon “ i would , ” like the poor cat i ' th ' adage ?
what beast was propn , then , that made you break this enterprise to me ?
what not put upon his spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt of our great quell ?
bring forth men - children only , for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males .
will it not be received , when we have marked with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers , that they have done propn ?
away , and mock the time with fairest show .
false face must hide what the false heart doth know .
how goes the night , boy ?
the moon is down .
i have not heard the clock .
and she goes down at twelve .
i take propn ’ tis later , sir .
hold , take my sword .
there ’ s husbandry in propn ; their candles are all out .
take thee that too .
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me , and yet i would not sleep .
merciful powers , propn in me the cursèd thoughts that nature gives way to in repose .
give me my sword .
who ’ s there ?
a friend .
what , sir , not yet at rest ?
the king propn a - bed .
he hath been in unusual pleasure , and sent forth great largess to your offices .
this diamond he greets your wife withal , by the name of most kind hostess , and shut up in measureless content .
being unprepared , our will became the servant to defect , which else should free have wrought .
what bloody man is that ?
he can report , as seemeth by his plight , of the revolt the newest state .
this is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought ' gainst my captivity .
propn , brave friend !
say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it .
doubtful it stood , as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art .
o valiant cousin !
worthy gentleman !
all ’ s well .
i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters : to you they have showed some truth .
i think not of them .
yet , when we can entreat an hour to serve , we would spend it in some words upon that business , if you would grant the time .
at your kind ’ st leisure .
if you shall cleave to my consent , when ’ tis , it shall make honor for you .
good repose the while !
thanks , sir : the like to you !
get thee to bed .
is this a dagger which i see before me , the handle toward my hand ?
propn i threat , he lives .
hear it not , propn , for it is a knell that summons thee to propn or to hell .
that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold .
what hath quenched them hath given me fire .
propn !
peace !
my husband !
i have done the deed .
propn thou not hear a noise ?
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
did not you speak ?
when ?
now .
as i descended ?
ay .
propn !
who lies i ' th ' second chamber ?
propn .
a foolish thought , to say a sorry sight .
one cried , “ propn bless us ! ” and “ amen ” the other , as they had seen me with these hangman ’ s hands .
list'ning their fear i could not say “ amen , ” when they did say “ propn bless us ! ” consider it not so deeply .
but wherefore could not i pronounce “ amen ” ?
i had most need of blessing , and “ amen ” stuck in my throat .
these deeds must not be thought after these ways .
so , it will make us mad .
methought i heard a voice cry , “ sleep no more !
what do you mean ?
still it cried , “ sleep no more ! ” to all the house .
go get some water , and wash this filthy witness from your hand .
why did you bring these daggers from the place ?
they must lie there .
go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood .
infirm of purpose !
give me the daggers .
the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures .
if he do bleed , i ’ ll gild the faces of the grooms withal , for it must seem their guilt .
whence is that knocking ?
how is propn with me when every noise appals me ?
i hear a knocking at the south entry .
propn we to our chamber .
a little water clears us of this deed .
how easy is it , then !
your constancy propn left you unattended .
propn !
more knocking .
get on your nightgown , lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers .
be not lost so poorly in your thoughts .
wake propn with thy knocking .
i would thou couldst .
propn , knock , knock !
propn , knock !
who ’ s there , in th ' other devil ’ s name ?
o , come in , equivocator .
propn , knock , knock !
who ’ s there ?
faith , here ’ s an english tailor come hither for stealing out of a french hose .
come in , tailor .
here you may roast your goose .
propn , knock !
never at quiet .
what are you ?
but this place is too cold for hell .
i ’ ll devil - porter it no further .
propn , anon !
i pray you , remember the porter .
was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , that you do lie so late ?
what three things does drink especially provoke ?
propn , sir , it provokes and unprovokes .
it provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance .
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
is thy master stirring ?
our knocking has awaked him .
here he comes .
good morrow , noble sir .
good morrow , both .
is the king stirring , worthy thane ?
not yet .
he did command me to call timely on him .
i have almost slipped the hour .
i ’ ll bring you to him .
i know this is a joyful trouble to you , but yet ’ tis one .
the labor we delight in physics pain .
this is the door .
i ’ ll make so bold to call , for ’ tis my limited service .
goes the king hence today ?
he does .
he did appoint so .
the night has been unruly .
where we lay , our chimneys were blown down and , as they say , propn heard i ' th ' air , strange screams of death , and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events propn hatched to the woeful time .
the obscure bird propn the livelong night .
some say the propn was feverous and did shake .
twas a rough night .
my young remembrance can not parallel a fellow to it .
o horror , horror , horror !
tongue nor heart can not conceive nor name thee !
what ’ s the matter ?
confusion now hath made his masterpiece .
the life ” ?
mean you his majesty ?
propn , propn of propn , mark : no sooner justice had , with valor armed , compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels , but the norweyan lord , surveying vantage , with furbished arms and new supplies of men , began a fresh assault .
propn not this our captains , propn and propn ?
yes , as sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion .
if i say sooth , i must report they were as cannons overcharged with double cracks , so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe .
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds ; they smack of honor both .
go get him surgeons .
who comes here ?
so should he look that seems to speak things strange .
approach the chamber , and destroy your sight with a new propn .
do not bid me speak .
see , and then speak yourselves .
propn , awake !
ring the alarum bell .
murder and treason !
propn and propn !
propn !
shake off this downy sleep , death propn counterfeit , and look on death itself !
up , up , and see the great doom ’ s image !
propn !
banquo !
as from your graves rise up , and walk like sprites , to countenance this horror !
speak , speak !
o gentle lady , ' propn not for you to hear what i can speak : the repetition , in a woman ’ s ear , would murder as it fell .
o propn , propn , our royal master ’ s murdered !
woe , alas !
what , in our house ?
propn propn , i prithee , contradict thyself , and say it is not so .
had i but died an hour before this chance , i had lived a blessèd time , for from this instant there ’ s nothing serious in mortality .
all is but toys .
propn and grace is dead .
the wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of .
what is amiss ?
you are , and do not know propn .
the spring , the head , the fountain of your blood is stopped ; the very source of it is stopped .
your royal father ’ s murdered .
oh , by whom ?
those of his chamber , as it seemed , had done propn .
their hands and faces were all badged with blood .
so were their daggers , which unwiped we found upon their pillows .
they stared , and were distracted .
no man ’ s life was to be trusted with them .
oh , yet i do repent me of my fury , that i did kill them .
propn did you so ?
who can be wise , amazed , temp'rate , and furious , loyal and neutral , in a moment ?
here lay propn , his silver skin laced with his golden blood , and his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature for ruin ’ s wasteful entrance ; there , the murderers , steeped in the colors of their trade , their daggers unmannerly breeched with gore .
who could refrain , that had a heart to love , and in that heart courage to make propn love known ?
help me hence , ho !
look to the lady .
fears and scruples shake us .
in the great hand of propn i stand , and thence against the undivulged pretense i fight of treasonous malice .
and so do i .
so all .
let ’ s briefly put on manly readiness , and meet i ' th ' hall together .
well contented .
what will you do ?
let ’ s not consort with them .
to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy .
i ’ ll to propn .
to propn , propn
our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer .
where we are , there ’ s daggers in men ’ s smiles .
the near in blood , the nearer bloody .
this murderous shaft that ’ s shot propn not yet lighted , and our safest way is to avoid the aim .
there ’ s warrant in that theft which steals itself when there ’ s no mercy left .
threescore and ten i can remember well , within the volume of which time i have seen hours dreadful and things strange , but this sore night propn trifled former knowings .
by th ' clock ’ tis day , and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp .
propn said they eat each other .
they did so , to th ' amazement of mine eyes that looked upon propn .
here comes the good propn .
how goes the world , sir , now ?
why , see you not ?
those that propn hath slain .
they were suborned .
propn and propn , the king ’ s two sons , are stol'n away and fled , which puts upon them propn of the deed .
thriftless ambition , that will raven up propn own lives ' means !
then ’ tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon propn .
he is already named and gone to propn to be invested .
where is propn ’ s body ?
carried to propn , the sacred storehouse of his predecessors , and guardian of their bones .
will you to propn ?
no , cousin , i ’ ll to propn .
well , i will thither .
well , may you see things well done there .
propn , lest our old robes sit easier than our new !
propn , father .
propn ’ s benison go with you and with those that would make good of bad and friends of foes .
yet it was said it should not stand in thy posterity , but that myself should be the root and father of many kings .
if there come truth from them— as upon thee , propn , their speeches shine— why , by the verities on thee made good , may they not be my oracles as well , and set me up in hope ?
but hush , no more .
here ’ s our chief guest .
let your highness propn upon me , to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie forever knit .
ride you this afternoon ?
ay , my good lord .
we should have else desired your good advice— which still hath been both grave and prosperous— in this day ’ s council , but we ’ ll take tomorrow .
is ’ t far you ride ?
as far , my lord , as will fill up the time ' propn this and supper .
go not my horse the better , i must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain .
fail not our feast .
my lord , i will not .
but of that tomorrow , when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly .
hie you to horse .
propn , till your return at night .
goes fleance with you ?
ay , my good lord .
our time does call upon propn .
propn .
let every man be master of his time till seven at night .
to make society the sweeter welcome , we will keep ourself propn suppertime alone .
while then , propn be with you !
bring them before us .
our fears in propn propn deep , and in his royalty of nature propn that which would be feared .
propn much he dares , and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor to act in safety .
there is none but he whose being i do fear , and under him my genius is rebuked , as it is said propn propn propn was by propn .
then , prophetlike , they hailed him father to a line of kings .
who ’ s there ?
propn save the king .
great happiness !
that now propn , the norways ' king , craves composition .
nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed at propn propn ’ s propn propn thousand dollars to our general use .
no more that thane of propn shall deceive our bosom interest : go pronounce his present death , and with his former title greet propn .
i ’ ll see it done .
what he hath lost , noble propn hath won .
now go to the door and stay there till we call .
was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
it was , so please your highness .
well then , now have you considered of my speeches ?
this i made good to you in our last conference , passed in probation with you , how you were borne in hand , how crossed , the instruments , who wrought with them , and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say , “ thus did propn . ” you made it known to us .
i did so , and went further , which is now our point of second meeting .
do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go ?
are you so gospeled to pray for this good man and for his issue , whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever ?
we are men , my liege .
ay , in the catalogue ye go for men , as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , curs , propn , water - rugs , and demi - wolves are clept all by the name of dogs .
and so of men .
i am one , my liege , whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world .
and i another so weary with disasters , tugged with fortune , that i would set my life on any chance , to mend it or be rid on propn .
both of you know propn was your enemy .
true , my lord .
we shall , my lord , perform what you command us .
though our lives— your spirits shine through you .
we are resolved , my lord .
i ’ ll call upon you straight .
abide within .
it is concluded .
propn , thy soul ’ s flight , if it find propn , must find it out tonight .
is propn gone from court ?
ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words .
propn , i will .
propn propn had , all ’ s spent , where our desire is got without content .
propn safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
how now , my lord !
what ’ s done is done .
we have scorched the snake , not killed it .
she ’ ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth .
better be with the dead , whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy .
propn has done his worst ; nor steel nor poison , propn domestic , foreign levy , nothing can touch him further .
come on , gentle my lord , propn o'er your rugged looks .
so shall i , love , and so , i pray , be you .
you must leave this .
thou know ’ st that propn , and his fleance , lives .
there ’ s comfort yet ; they are assailable .
then be thou jocund .
ere the bat hath flown his cloistered flight , ere to black propn ’ s summons the shard - borne beetle with his drowsy hums propn rung night ’ s yawning peal , there shall be done a deed of dreadful note .
what ’ s to be done ?
what many men desire ” —that “ many ” may be meant by the fool multitude that choose by show , not learning more than the fond eye doth teach ; which pries not to th ' interior , but like the martlet propn in the weather on the outward wall , even in the force and road of casualty .
i will not choose what many men desire because i will not jump with common spirits and rank me with the barbarous multitudes .
why then , to thee , thou silver treasure house .
tell me once more what title thou dost bear .
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . ” and well said too — for who shall go about to cozen fortune and be honorable without the stamp of merit ?
let none presume to wear an undeservèd dignity .
oh , that estates , degrees and offices were not derived corruptly , and that clear honor were purchased by the merit of the wearer !
how many then should cover that stand bare !
how much low peasantry would then be gleaned from the true seed of honor !
well , but to my choice .
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . ” i will assume desert .— give me a key for this , and instantly unlock my fortunes here .
too long a pause for that which you find there .
what ’ s here ?
i will read it.— how much unlike art thou to propn !
who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves ” !
did i deserve no more than a fool ’ s head ?
is that my prize ?
are my deserts no better ?
what is here ?
the fire seven times tried this , seven times tried that judgment is , that did never choose amiss .
some there be that shadows kiss .
such have but a shadow ’ s bliss .
there be fools alive , iwis , propn o'er — and so was this .
take what wife you will to bed , i will ever be your head .
so be gone .
with one fool ’ s head i came to woo , but i go away with two.— propn , adieu .
i ’ ll keep my oath patiently to bear my wroth . ”
thus hath the candle singed the moth .
o these deliberate fools !
when they do choose , they have the wisdom by their wit to lose .
the ancient saying is no heresy .
hanging and wiving goes by destiny .
come , draw the curtain , propn .
where is my lady ?
here .
what would my lord ?
yet i have not seen so likely an ambassador of love .
no more , i pray thee .
i am half afeard propn wilt say anon he is some kin to thee , thou spend ’ st such high - day wit in praising propn propn , come , propn , for i long to see propn propn ’ s post that comes so mannerly .
now , what news on the propn ?
but it is true , without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk , that the good propn , the honest antonio — oh , that i had a title good enough to keep his name company ! — propn , the full stop .
ha , what sayest thou ?
why , the end is he hath lost a ship .
i would it might prove the end of his losses .
let me say “ amen ” betimes , lest the propn cross my prayer , for here he comes in the likeness of a propn .
how now , propn ?
what news among the merchants ?
you knew — none so well , none so well as you — of my daughter ’ s flight .
that ’ s certain .
i , for my part , knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal .
she is damned for it .
that ’ s certain — if the devil may be her judge .
my own flesh and blood to rebel !
out upon it , old carrion !
rebels it at these years ?
i say my daughter is my flesh and blood .
but tell us , do you hear whether propn have had any loss at sea or no ?
well , we will leave you then till dinnertime .
i must be one of these same dumb wise men , for propn never lets me speak .
well , keep me company but two years more , propn shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue .
propn .
i ’ ll grow a talker for this gear .
is that any thing now ?
propn speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all propn .
well , tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage , that you today promised to tell me of ?
there i have another bad match ! —a bankrupt , a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the propn , a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart .
let him look to his bond .
he was wo nt to call me usurer ; let him look to his bond .
he was wo nt to lend money for a christian courtesy ; let him look to his bond .
why , i am sure , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh .
what ’ s that good for ?
to bait fish withal .
he hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million , laughed at my losses , mocked at my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies — and what ’ s his reason ?
i am a propn .
propn not a propn eyes ?
propn not a propn hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?
propn with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a propn is ?
if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
if you poison us , do we not die ?
and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?
if we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .
if a propn wrong a propn , what is his humility ?
revenge .
we have been up and down to seek him .
here comes another of the tribe .
a third can not be matched unless the devil himself turn propn .
how now , propn ?
what news from propn ?
propn thou found my daughter ?
i often came where i did hear of her , but can not find her .
why , there , there , there , there !
i never felt it till now — two thousand ducats in that , and other precious , precious jewels .
i would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear !
would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin !
no news of them ?
why , so .
and i know not what ’ s spent in the search .
why thou , loss upon loss !
yes , other men have ill luck too .
antonio , as i heard in propn what , what , what ?
ill luck , ill luck ?
propn an argosy cast away coming from propn .
i thank propn , i thank propn !
is ’ t true , is propn true ?
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack .
i thank thee , good propn .
good news , good news !
ha , ha , heard in propn .
your daughter spent in propn , as i heard , in one night fourscore ducats .
thou stickest a dagger in me .
i shall never see my gold again .
fourscore ducats at a sitting !
fourscore ducats !
there came divers of propn ’ s creditors in my company to propn that swear he can not choose but break .
i am very glad of it .
i ’ ll plague him .
i ’ ll torture him .
i am glad of it .
one of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey .
out upon her !
thou torturest me , propn .
it was my turquoise .
i had it of propn when i was a bachelor .
i would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys .
but propn is certainly undone .
nay , that ’ s true , that ’ s very true .
bespeak him a fortnight before .— i will have the heart of him if he forfeit , for were he out of propn i can make what merchandise i will .— go , go , propn , and meet me at our synagogue .
go , good propn .
at our synagogue , propn .
before you hazard , for in choosing wrong i lose your company .
therefore forbear awhile .
there may as well be amity and life ' tween snow and fire , as treason and my love .
promise me life , and i ’ ll confess the truth .
well then , confess and live .
confess and love ” had been the very sum of my confession .
but let me to my fortune and the caskets .
away , then .
i am locked in one of them .
if you do love me you will find me propn propn and the rest , stand all aloof .
let music sound while he doth make his choice .
then if he lose he makes a swanlike end , fading in music .
he may win , and what is music then ?
the rest aloof are the dardanian wives , with blearèd visages come forth to view the issue of th ' exploit .— go , propn !
live thou , i live .
with much , much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray .
propn , dong , bell .
how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of propn and frowning propn , who , inward searched , have livers white as milk , and these assume but valor ’ s excrement to render them redoubted .
so are those crispèd snaky golden locks which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind , upon supposèd fairness , often known to be the dowry of a second head , the skull that bred them in the sepulcher .
thus ornament is but the guilèd shore to a most dangerous sea , the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty — in a word , the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest .
therefore then , thou gaudy gold , hard food for propn , i will none of thee .
since this fortune falls to you , be content and seek no new .
if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss , turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss . ”
a gentle scroll .
fair lady , by your leave , i come by note to give and to receive .
like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in people ’ s eyes , hearing applause and universal shout , propn in spirit , still gazing in a doubt whether these pearls of praise be his or no— so , thrice fair lady , stand i even so , as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirmed , signed , ratified by you .
you see me , propn propn , where i stand such as i am .
though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better , yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself— a thousand times more fair , ten thousand times more rich— that only to stand high in your account i might in virtue , beauties , livings , friends exceed account .
happier than this— she is not bred so dull but she can learn .
happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord , her governor , her king .
myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted .
but now i was the lord of this fair mansion , master of my servants , propn o'er myself .
and even now , but now , this house , these servants , and this same myself are yours , my lord ’ s .
i give them with this ring , which when you part from , lose , or give away , let it presage the ruin of your love
i pray you , good propn , let me know it .
and if it stand , as you yourself still do , within the eye of honor , be assured my purse , my person , my extremest means lie all unlocked to your occasions .
in my school days , when i had lost one shaft , i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight the selfsame way with more advisèd watch to find the other forth — and by adventuring both , i oft found both .
i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence .
i owe you much , and , like a willful youth , that which i owe is lost .
you know me well , and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance .
and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have .
then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done , and i am pressed unto it .
therefore speak .
o , then be bold to say propn ’ s dead !
my lord and lady , it is now our time , that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper , to cry , “ good joy , good joy , my lord and lady ! ” my propn propn and my gentle lady , i wish you all the joy that you can wish , for i am sure you can wish none from me .
and when your honors mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith , i do beseech you even at that time i may be married too .
with all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
i thank your lordship , you have got me one .
what , and stake down ?
what , and my old venetian friend propn ?
propn and propn , welcome hither , if that the youth of my new interest here have power to bid you welcome .
so do i , my lord .
they are entirely welcome .
and i have reason for it .
propn propn commends him to you .
propn i ope his letter , i pray you tell me how my good friend doth .
not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind , nor well , unless in mind .
his letter there will show you his estate .
there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the color from propn ’ s cheek .
some dear friend dead , else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man .
what , worse and worse ? — with leave , propn , i am half yourself , and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you .
o sweet propn , here are a few of the unpleasant ’ st words that ever blotted paper .
propn lady , when i did first impart my love to you , i freely told you , all the wealth i had propn in my veins .
i was a gentleman , and then i told you true .
when i told you my state was nothing , i should then have told you that i was worse than nothing , for indeed i have engaged myself to a dear friend , engaged my friend to his mere enemy to feed my means .
have all his ventures failed ?
what , not one hit ?
not one , my lord .
besides , it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the propn , he would not take it .
never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man .
he plies the duke at morning and at night , and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice .
when i was with him i have heard him swear to propn and to propn , his countrymen , that he would rather have propn ’ s flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him .
and i know , my lord , if law , authority , and power deny not , it will go hard with poor propn .
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble ?
what sum owes he the propn ?
for me , three thousand ducats .
what , no more ?
pay him six thousand and deface the bond !
you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over .
when it is paid , bring your true friend along .
my maid propn and myself meantime will live as maids and widows .
bid your friends welcome , show a merry cheer .
but let me hear the letter of your friend .
propn propn , my ships have all miscarried .
my creditors grow cruel .
my estate is very low .
my bond to the propn is forfeit .
notwithstanding , use your pleasure .
if your love do not persuade you to come , let not my letter . ” o love , dispatch all business and be gone !
since i have your good leave to go away , i will make haste .
but till i come again , no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay , no rest be interposer ’ twixt us twain .
propn , look to him .
this is the fool that lent out money gratis .
propn , look to him .
hear me yet , good propn .
i pray thee , hear me speak .
i ’ ll have my bond .
i will not hear thee speak .
i ’ ll have my bond , and therefore speak no more .
i ’ ll not be made a soft and dull - eyed fool to shake the head , relent and sigh , and yield to christian intercessors .
follow not .
i ’ ll have no speaking .
i will have my bond .
it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men .
let him alone .
i ’ ll follow him no more with bootless prayers .
he seeks my life .
his reason well i know .
i oft delivered from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me .
therefore he hates me .
i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold .
therefore go .
these griefs and losses have so bated me , that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh propn to my bloody creditor.— well , jailer , on .— pray propn propn come to see me pay his debt , and then i care not .
lorenzo , i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord ’ s return .
propn , with all my heart .
i shall obey you in all fair commands .
my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and propn in place of propn propn and myself .
so fare you well till we shall meet again .
fare you well , propn .
now , propn , as i have ever found thee honest true , so let me find thee still .
sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages .
her name is propn , nothing undervalued to propn ’ s daughter , propn ' propn .
i shall be there before thee .
propn , i go with all convenient speed .
come on , propn , i have work in hand that you yet know not of .
we ’ ll see our husbands before they think of us .
shall they see us ?
they shall , propn , but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplishèd with that we lack .
and twenty of these puny lies i ’ ll tell , that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth .
i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice .
why , shall we turn to men ?
propn , what a question ’ s that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
but come , i ’ ll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach , which stays for us at the park gate .
and therefore haste away , for we must measure twenty miles today .
yes , truly , for look you , the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children .
therefore i promise ye i fear you .
i was always plain with you , and so now i speak my agitation of the matter .
therefore be o ' good cheer , for truly i think you are damned .
there is but one hope in it that can do you any good , and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither .
and what hope is that , i pray thee ?
marry , you may partly hope that your father got you not , that you are not the propn ’ s daughter .
that were a kind of bastard hope indeed .
so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother .
thus when i shun propn your father , i fall into propn your mother .
well , you are gone both ways .
i shall be saved by my husband .
he hath made me a propn .
truly , the more to blame he .
we were propn eno ' before , e'en as many as could well live one by another .
this making propn will raise the price of hogs .
if we grow all to be pork - eaters , we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money .
i ’ ll tell my husband , launcelot , what you say .
here he comes .
i shall grow jealous of you shortly , launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
nay , you need not fear us , propn .
launcelot and i are out .
he tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in propn because i am a propn ’ s daughter , and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth , for in converting propn to propn you raise the price of pork .
i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the propn ’ s belly .
it is much that the propn should be more than reason .
i think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence , and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots .
that is done , sir .
they have all stomachs .
goodly propn , what a wit - snapper are you !
propn thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant ?
for the table , sir , it shall be served in .
for the meat , sir , it shall be covered .
for your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
o dear discretion , how his words are suited !
how cheerest thou , propn ?
how dost thou like the propn propn ’ s wife ?
past all expressing .
and if on earth he do not merit it , in reason he should never come to propn .
why , if two gods should play some heavenly match and on the wager lay two earthly women , and propn one , there must be something else pawned with the other , for the poor rude world propn not her fellow .
even such a husband propn thou of me as she is for a wife .
first let us go to dinner .
nay , let me praise you while i have a stomach .
no , pray thee , let it serve for table talk .
what , is propn here ?
ready , so please your grace .
i am sorry for thee .
thou art come to answer a stony adversary , an inhuman wretch propn of pity , void and empty from any dram of mercy .
i have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify his rigorous course .
but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy ’ s reach , i do oppose my patience to his fury , and am armed to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his .
go , one , and call the propn into the court .
he is ready at the door .
he comes , my lord .
we all expect a gentle answer , propn .
i have possessed your grace of what i purpose , and by our holy propn have i sworn to have the due and forfeit of my bond .
if you deny it , let the danger light upon your charter and your city ’ s freedom .
you ’ ll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats .
i ’ ll not answer that but say it is my humour .
is it answered ?
what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats to have it baned ?
what , are you answered yet ?
some men there are love not a gaping pig , some that are mad if they behold a cat , and others , when the bagpipe sings i ' th ' nose , can not contain their urine .
are you answered ?
this is no answer , thou unfeeling man , to excuse the current of thy cruelty .
i am not bound to please thee with my answers .
do all men kill the things they do not love ?
what , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ?
you may as well do anything most hard , as seek to soften that — than which what ’ s harder ? — his jewish heart .
i would have my bond .
how shalt thou hope for mercy , rendering none ?
what judgment shall i dread , doing no wrong ?
you have among you many a purchased slave , which — like your asses and your dogs and propn you use in abject and in slavish parts because you bought them .
shall i say to you , “ let them be free !
marry them to your heirs !
why sweat they under burdens ?
let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be seasoned with such viands ” ?
you will answer , “ the slaves are ours . ” so do i answer you .
the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought .
propn mine and i will have it .
if you deny me , fie upon your law— there is no force in the decrees of propn .
i stand for judgment .
by my troth , propn , my little body is aweary of this great world .
and yet for aught i see , they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing .
it is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean .
good sentences , and well pronounced .
they would be better if well followed .
it is a good divine that follows his own instructions .
but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband .
is it not hard , propn , that i can not choose one nor refuse none ?
upon my power i may dismiss this court , unless propn , a learnèd doctor , whom i have sent for to determine this , come here today .
bring us the letter .
call the messenger .
good cheer , propn !
what , man , courage yet !
the propn shall have my flesh , blood , bones and all , propn thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood .
i am a tainted wether of the flock , propn for death .
the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground , and so let me .
you can not better be employed , propn , than to live still and write mine epitaph .
came you from propn , from propn ?
from both , my lord .
bellario greets your grace .
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .
not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh propn , propn makest thy knife keen .
but no metal can— no , not the hangman ’ s axe — bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy .
can no prayers pierce thee ?
no , none that thou hast wit enough to make .
thou almost makest me waver in my faith to hold opinion with propn that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men .
thy currish spirit governed a wolf who , hanged for human slaughter , even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet , and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam infused itself in thee , for thy desires are wolvish , bloody , starved , and ravenous .
till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond , propn but offend ’ st thy lungs to speak so loud .
repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall to cureless ruin .
i stand here for law .
this letter from propn doth commend a young and learnèd doctor to our court .
where is he ?
he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether you ’ ll admit him .
with all my heart .— some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place.— meantime the court shall hear propn ’ s letter .
his name is propn .
i leave him to your gracious acceptance , whose trial shall better publish his commendation . ” you hear the learned propn , what he writes .
come you from old propn ?
i did , my lord .
you are welcome .
take your place .
are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court ?
i am informèd thoroughly of the cause .
antonio and old propn , both stand forth .
is your name propn ?
propn is my name .
of a strange nature is the suit you follow , yet in such rule that the venetian law can not impugn you as you do proceed.— ay , so he says .
do you confess the bond ?
i do .
then must the propn be merciful .
on what compulsion must i ?
tell me that .
the quality of mercy is not strained .
it droppeth as the gentle rain from propn upon the place beneath .
it is twice blessed : it blesseth him that gives and him that takes .
propn mightiest in the mightiest .
it becomes the thronèd monarch better than his crown .
and earthly power doth then show likest propn ’ s when mercy seasons justice .
i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea , which if thou follow , this strict court of propn must needs give sentence ' gainst the merchant there .
my deeds upon my head .
i crave the law , the penalty , and forfeit of my bond .
is he not able to discharge the money ?
if that will not suffice , i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er , on forfeit of my hands , my head , my heart .
there is no power in propn can alter a decree establishèd .
propn be recorded for a precedent , and many an error by the same example will rush into the state .
it can not be .
i pray you , let me look upon the bond .
shylock , there ’ s thrice thy money offered thee .
an oath , an oath , i have an oath in propn .
shall i lay perjury upon my soul ?
no , not for propn .
and lawfully by this the propn may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off propn the merchant ’ s heart .— be merciful .
take thrice thy money .
bid me tear the bond .
when it is paid according to the tenor .
it doth appear you are a worthy judge .
you know the law .
i charge you by the law , propn you are a well - deserving pillar , propn to judgment .
by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me .
i stay here on my bond .
most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment .
why then , thus it is : you must prepare your bosom for his knife .
o noble judge !
o excellent young man !
for the intent and purpose of the law propn full relation to the penalty , which here appeareth due upon the bond .
propn very true .
o wise and upright judge !
how much more elder art thou than thy looks !
ay , his breast .
nearest his heart ” —those are the very words .
it is so .
are there balance here to weigh the flesh ?
i have them ready .
have by some surgeon , propn , on your charge , to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death .
is it so nominated in the bond ?
it is not so expressed , but what of that ?
twere good you do so much for charity .
i can not find it .
propn not in the bond .
but little .
i am armed and well prepared.— give me your hand , propn .
fare you well .
propn not that i am fall'n to this for you , for herein propn shows herself more kind than is her custom .
repent but you that you shall lose your friend , and he repents not that he pays your debt .
for if the propn do cut but deep enough , i ’ ll pay it presently with all my heart .
antonio , i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself .
but life itself , my wife , and all the world are not with me esteemed above thy life .
i would lose all — ay , sacrifice them all here to this devil — to deliver you .
your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer .
i have a wife , whom i protest i love .
i would she were in propn , so she could entreat some power to change this currish propn .
propn well you offer it behind her back .
these be the christian husbands .
i have a daughter .
the court awards it , and the law doth give it .
most rightful judge !
and you must cut this flesh from off his breast .
the law allows it , and the court awards it .
most learnèd judge , a sentence !
come , prepare .
tarry a little .
there is something else .
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood .
the words expressly are “ a pound of flesh . ” take then thy bond , take thou thy pound of flesh , but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood , thy lands and goods are by the laws of propn confiscate unto the state of propn .
is that the law ?
thyself shalt see the act .
for as thou urgest justice , be assured propn shalt have justice more than thou desirest .
i take this offer then : pay the bond thrice and let the propn go .
here is the money .
soft !
the propn shall have all justice .
soft , no haste .
he shall have nothing but the penalty .
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh .
if thou takest more or less than a just pound , be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple — nay , if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair , propn diest and all thy goods are confiscate .
a second daniel ! —a propn , propn !
now , infidel , i have you on the hip .
why doth the propn pause ?
take thy forfeiture .
give me my principal , and let me go .
i have it ready for thee .
here it is .
your father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations .
i pray thee , overname them .
first , there is the neapolitan prince .
i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith .
then there is the propn propn .
he doth nothing but frown , as who should say , “ an you will not have me , choose . ” he hears merry tales and smiles not .
i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .
i had rather be married to a death ’ s - head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these .
propn defend me from these two !
how say you by the french lord , propn le propn ?
he hath refused it in the open court .
he shall have merely justice and his bond .
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril , propn .
why then , the devil give him good of it !
i ’ ll stay no longer question .
tarry , propn .
the law hath yet another hold on you .
it is enacted in the laws of propn , if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen , the party ' gainst the which he doth contrive propn seize one half his goods .
the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state , and the offender ’ s life lies in the mercy of the propn only ' gainst all other voice .
down , therefore , and beg mercy of the propn .
therefore thou must be hanged at the state ’ s charge .
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it .
for half thy wealth , it is propn propn .
the other half comes to the general state , which humbleness may drive unto a fine .
ay , for the state , not for propn .
nay , take my life and all .
pardon not that .
you take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house .
you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live .
what mercy can you render him , propn ?
a halter gratis , nothing else , for propn ’ s sake .
so please my lord the duke and all the court , to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content , so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter .
two things provided more : that for this favor he presently become a propn ; the other , that he do record a gift here in the court , of all he dies possessed , unto his son propn and his daughter .
he shall do this , or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronouncèd here .
art thou contented , propn ?
what dost thou say ?
i am content .
i pray you , give me leave to go from hence .
i am not well .
send the deed after me , and i will sign it .
get thee gone , but do it .
i must away this night toward propn , and it is meet i presently set forth .
i am sorry that your leisure serves you not.— propn , gratify this gentleman , for in my mind you are much bound to him .
and stand indebted , over and above , in love and service to you evermore .
he is well paid that is well satisfied .
and i , delivering you , am satisfied , and therein do account myself well paid .
my mind was never yet more mercenary .
i pray you , know me when we meet again .
i wish you well , and so i take my leave .
take some remembrance of us as a tribute , not as a fee .
this ring , good sir — alas , it is a trifle .
i will not shame myself to give you this .
i will have nothing else but only this .
and now methinks i have a mind to it .
there ’ s more depends on this than on the value .
the dearest ring in propn will i give you , and find it out by proclamation .
only for this , i pray you , pardon me .
i see , sir , you are liberal in offers .
you taught me first to beg , and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered .
good sir , this ring was given me by my wife .
and when she put it on , she made me vow that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it .
that ’ scuse serves many men to save their gifts .
an if your wife be not a madwoman , and know how well i have deserved the ring , she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me .
well , peace be with you .
my propn propn , let him have the ring .
come , you and i will thither presently .
and in the morning early will we both fly toward propn .
come , propn .
inquire the propn ’ s house out .
give him this deed , and let him sign it .
we ’ ll away tonight , and be a day before our husbands home .
this deed will be well welcome to propn .
furthermore , i pray you show my youth old propn ’ s house .
that will i do .
away , make haste .
thou know ’ st where i will tarry .
the moon shines bright .
in such a night as this , when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise , in such a night propn methinks mounted the propn walls and sighed his soul toward the grecian tents where propn lay that night .
in such a night did young propn swear he loved her well , stealing her soul with many vows of faith , and ne'er a true one .
in such a night did pretty propn , like a little shrew , slander her love , and he forgave it her .
but , hark , i hear the footing of a man .
who comes so fast in silence of the night ?
a friend .
a friend ?
what friend ?
your name , i pray you , friend ?
propn is my name , and i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at propn .
she doth stray about by holy crosses , where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours .
who comes with her ?
none but a holy hermit and her maid .
i pray you , is my master yet returned ?
sola , sola !
wo , ha , ho !
sola , sola !
who calls ?
sola !
did you see propn propn ?
leave holloaing , man .
here .
sola !
where , where ?
here .
tell him there ’ s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news .
my master will be here ere morning .
sweet soul , let ’ s in , and there expect their coming .
and yet no matter .
propn made him and therefore let him pass for a man .
in truth , i know it is a sin to be a mocker , but he ! —why , he hath a horse better than the propn propn , a better bad habit of frowning than the propn propn .
what say you then to propn , the young baron of propn ?
you know i say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor i him .
he hath neither propn , propn , nor italian , and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the propn .
he is a proper man ’ s picture , but alas , who can converse with a dumb show ?
how oddly he is suited !
i think he bought his doublet in propn , his round hose in propn , his bonnet in propn , and his behavior everywhere .
what think you of the scottish lord , his neighbor ?
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
here will we sit and let the sounds of music propn in our ears .
soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony .
sit , propn .
look how the floor of propn is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold .
come ho , and wake propn with a hymn !
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ' ear , and draw her home with music .
i am never merry when i hear sweet music .
the motions of his spirit are dull as night , and his affections dark as propn .
let no such man be trusted .
mark the music .
that light we see is burning in my hall .
how far that little candle throws his beams !
so shines a good deed in a naughty world .
when the moon shone we did not see the candle .
so doth the greater glory dim the less .
a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by , and then his state propn itself , as doth an inland brook into the main of waters .
music , hark .
it is your music , madam , of the house .
nothing is good , i see , without respect .
how many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection !
peace !
how the moon sleeps with propn and would not be awaked .
that is the voice , or i am much deceived , of propn .
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo— by the bad voice .
dear lady , welcome home .
we have been praying for our husbands ' welfare , which speed , we hope , the better for our words .
are they returned ?
go in , propn .
give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence.— nor you , propn .— propn , nor you .
i hear his trumpet .
this night methinks is but the daylight sick .
it looks a little paler .
propn a day such as the day is when the sun is hid .
i thank you , madam .
give welcome to my friend .
this is the man , this is propn , to whom i am so infinitely bound .
propn , you are very welcome to our house .
it must appear in other ways than words , therefore i scant this breathing courtesy .
a quarrel , ho , already ?
what ’ s the matter ?
about a hoop of gold , a paltry ring that she did give me , whose posy was for all the world like cutler ’ s poetry upon a knife , “ love me and leave me not . ” what talk you of the posy or the value ?
you swore to me when i did give it you that you would wear it till your hour of death , and that it should lie with you in your grave .
gave it a judge ’ s clerk !
he will , an if he live to be a man .
ay , if a woman live to be a man .
i could not for my heart deny it him .
you were to blame , i must be plain with you , to part so slightly with your wife ’ s first gift , a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh .
i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it .
and here he stands .
i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters .
now in faith , propn , you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief .
an ’ twere to me , i should be mad at it .
my propn propn gave his ring away unto the judge that begged it and indeed deserved it too .
and then the boy , his clerk , that took some pains in writing , he begged mine .
and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings .
what ring gave you my lord ?
not that , i hope , which you received of me .
if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it .
but you see my finger propn not the ring upon it .
it is gone .
propn propn , if you did know to whom i gave the ring , if you did know for whom i gave the ring , and would conceive for what i gave the ring , and how unwillingly i left the ring when naught would be accepted but the ring , you would abate the strength of your displeasure .
if you had known the virtue of the ring , or half her worthiness that gave the ring , or your own honor to contain the ring , you would not then have parted with the ring .
propn teaches me what to believe .
i ’ ll die for propn but some woman had the ring .
what should i say , sweet lady ?
i was enforced to send it after him .
let not that doctor e'er come near my house !
since he hath got the jewel that i loved , and that which you did swear to keep for me , i will become as liberal as you .
i ’ ll not deny him anything i have , no , not my body , nor my husband ’ s bed .
know him i shall , i am well sure of it .
lie not a night from home .
watch me like propn .
if you do not , if i be left alone , now , by mine honor — which is yet mine own— i ’ ll have that doctor for my bedfellow .
i am th ' unhappy subject of these quarrels .
propn , grieve not you .
propn , forgive me this enforcèd wrong , and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself— propn you but that !
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself— in each eye , one .
swear by your double self , and there ’ s an oath of credit !
nay , but hear me .
pardon this fault , and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee .
i once did lend my body for his wealth , which but for him that had your husband ’ s ring had quite miscarried .
by propn , it is the same i gave the doctor !
i had it of him .
what , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?
speak not so grossly .— you are all amazed .
i am dumb .
ay , but the clerk that never means to do it unless he live until he be a man .
sweet lady , you have given me life and living .
how like you the young propn , the propn of propn ’ s nephew ?
very vilely in the morning , when he is sober , and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk .
when he is best he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst he is little better than a beast .
i will do any thing , propn , ere i ’ ll be married to a sponge .
you need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords .
and i pray propn grant them a fair departure .
do you not remember , lady , in your father ’ s time a propn , a scholar and a soldier , that came hither in company of the propn of propn ?
how now , propn ?
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you .
ay , and i ’ ll give them him without a fee .
fair ladies , you drop manna in the way of starvèd people .
it is almost morning , and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full .
let us go in , and charge us there upon interr'gatories , and we will answer all things faithfully .
let it be so .
the first interr'gatory that my propn shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay , or go to bed now , being two hours to day .
but were the day come , i should wish it dark , that i were couching with the doctor ’ s clerk .
true , madam .
he , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .
i remember him well , and i remember him worthy of thy praise .
how now , what news ?
the four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave .
and there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the propn of propn , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell , i should be glad of his approach .
if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , i had rather he should shrive me than wive me .
come , propn
three thousand ducats , well .
ay , sir , for three months .
for three months , well .
for the which , as i told you , propn shall be bound .
antonio shall become bound , well .
may you stead me ?
will you pleasure me ?
shall i know your answer ?
three thousand ducats for three months , and propn bound .
your answer to that ?
antonio is a good man .
have you heard any imputation to the contrary ?
yet his means are in supposition .
he hath an argosy bound to propn , another to the propn .
i understand moreover , upon the propn , he hath a third at propn , a fourth for propn , and other ventures he hath squandered abroad .
but ships are but boards , sailors but men .
there be land rats and water rats , water thieves and land thieves — i mean pirates — and then there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks .
the man is notwithstanding sufficient .
be assured you may .
this is propn propn .
in sooth , i know not why i am so sad .
it wearies me ; you say it wearies you .
believe me , sir , had i such venture forth , the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad .
and every object that might make me fear propn to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad .
propn , do you hear ?
i am debating of my present store , and by the near guess of my memory i can not instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats .
what of that ?
propn , a wealthy hebrew of my tribe , will furnish me .
but soft !
how many months do you desire ?
shylock , albeit i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess , yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend , i ’ ll break a custom .
ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
and for three months .
i had forgot — three months .
you told me so .
i do never use it .
when propn grazed his uncle propn propn sheep— this propn from our holy propn was , as his wise mother wrought in his behalf , the third possessor , ay , he was the third— and what of him ?
did he take interest ?
this was a venture , sir , that propn served for— a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayed and fashioned by the hand of propn .
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
but note me , signor—
an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek , a goodly apple rotten at the heart .
oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
three months from twelve , then .
let me see .
the rate— well , propn , shall we be beholding to you ?
propn propn , many a time and oft in the propn you have rated me about my moneys and my usances .
you call me misbeliever , cutthroat dog , and spet upon my jewish gaberdine— and all for use of that which is mine own .
well then , it now appears you need my help .
go to , then !
you come to me and you say , “ propn , we would have moneys . ” you say so ! — you , that did void your rheum upon my beard and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur over your threshold !
moneys is your suit .
what should i say to you ?
should i not say , “ propn a dog money ?
is it possible a cur can lend three thousand ducats ? ” or propn i bend low and in a bondman ’ s key with bated breath and whispering humbleness say this :
if thou wilt lend this money , lend it not as to thy friends , for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend ?
but lend it rather to thine enemy , who , if he break , thou mayst with better face propn the penalty .
why , look you how you storm !
i would be friends with you and have your love , forget the shames that you have stained me with , supply your present wants and take no doit of usance for my moneys — and you ’ ll not hear me !
this is kind i offer .
this were kindness .
this kindness will i show .
go with me to a notary , seal me there your single bond , and — in a merry sport— if you repay me not on such a day , in such a place , such sum or sums as are expressed in the condition , let the forfeit be nominated for an equal pound of your fair flesh , to be cut off and taken in what part of your body pleaseth me .
content , in faith .
i ’ ll seal to such a bond , and say there is much kindness in the propn .
you shall not seal to such a bond for me !
i ’ ll rather dwell in my necessity .
within these two months — that ’ s a month before this bond expires — i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond .
a pound of man ’ s flesh taken from a man is not so estimable , profitable neither , as flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats .
if he will take it , so .
if not , adieu .
and for my love i pray you wrong me not .
yes , propn , i will seal unto this bond .
then meet me forthwith at the notary ’ s .
give him direction for this merry bond , and i will go and purse the ducats straight , see to my house left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave , and presently i will be with you .
hie thee , gentle propn .
my ships come home a month before the day .
i would not change this hue except to steal your thoughts , my gentle queen .
even for that i thank you .
therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets to try my fortune .
by this scimitar that slew the propn and a persian prince that won three fields of propn propn , i would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look , propn the heart most daring on the earth , propn the young sucking cubs from the she - bear , propn , mock the lion when he roars for prey , to win the lady .
but , alas the while !
nor will not .
come , bring me unto my chance .
first , forward to the temple .
after dinner your hazard shall be made .
certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this propn , my master .
for the heavens , rouse up a brave mind , ” says the fiend , “ and run . ” well , my conscience , hanging about the neck of my heart , says very wisely to me , “ my honest friend launcelot , being an honest man ’ s son ” —or rather an honest woman ’ s son , for indeed my father did something smack , something grow to .
he had a kind of taste .— well , my conscience says , “ launcelot , budge not . ” “ propn ! ” says the fiend .
budge not , ” says my conscience .
conscience , ” say i , “ you counsel well . ” “ fiend , ” say i , “ you counsel well . ” to be ruled by my conscience i should stay with the propn my master , who , propn bless the mark , is a kind of devil .
and to run away from the propn i should be ruled by the fiend , who , saving your reverence , is the devil himself .
the fiend gives the more friendly counsel .
i will run , fiend .
i will run .
propn young man , you , i pray you , which is the way to propn propn propn ?
propn young gentleman , i pray you , which is the way to propn propn propn ?
turn up on your right hand at the next turning , but at the next turning of all on your left .
marry , at the very next turning turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the propn ’ s house .
by propn ’ s sonties , ’ twill be a hard way to hit .
can you tell me whether one launcelot that dwells with him , dwell with him or no ?
talk you of young propn propn ?
no “ master , ” sir , but a poor man ’ s son .
his father , though i say propn , is an honest exceeding poor man and , propn be thanked , well to live .
your worship ’ s friend and propn , sir .
shall i have the thought to think on this , and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad ?
but tell not me .
believe me , no .
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
why then , you are in love .
not in love neither ?
but i pray you , ergo , old man , ergo , i beseech you , talk you of young propn propn ?
propn , propn propn .
marry , propn forbid !
the boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .
do i look like a cudgel or a hovel - post , a staff or a prop ?
do you know me , propn ?
alack the day , i know you not , young gentleman .
but i pray you , tell me , is my boy , propn rest his soul , alive or dead ?
do you not know me , propn ?
propn , sir , i am sand - blind .
i know you not .
nay , indeed if you had your eyes , you might fail of the knowing me .
it is a wise father that knows his own child .
well , old man , i will tell you news of your son .
give me your blessing .
pray you , sir , stand up .
i am sure you are not launcelot , my boy .
pray you , let ’ s have no more fooling about it , but give me your blessing .
i am launcelot , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be .
i can not think you are my son .
her name is propn , indeed .
i ’ ll be sworn , if thou be launcelot , thou art mine own flesh and blood .
it should seem then that propn ’ s tail grows backward .
i am sure he had more hair of his tail than i have of my face when i last saw him .
propn , how art thou changed !
how dost thou and thy master agree ?
i have brought him a present .
how ' gree you now ?
my master ’ s a very propn .
give him a present .
give him a halter .
i am famished in his service .
you may tell every finger i have with my ribs .
propn , i am glad you are come .
give me your present to one propn propn , who indeed gives rare new liveries .
gramercy !
propn thou aught with me ?
what would you ?
serve you , sir .
that is the very defect of the matter , sir .
i know thee well .
thou hast obtained thy suit .
propn , in .
my best endeavours shall be done herein .
yonder , sir , he walks .
propn propn !
propn !
i have a suit to you .
you have obtained it .
you must not deny me .
i must go with you to propn .
why , then you must .
but hear thee , propn .
thou art too wild , too rude and bold of voice— parts that become thee happily enough and in such eyes as ours appear not faults .
pray thee , take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty propn skipping spirit , lest through thy wild behavior i be misconst ’ red in the place i go to , and lose my hopes .
propn propn , hear me .
if i do not put on a sober habit , talk with respect and swear but now and then , wear prayer books in my pocket , look demurely— propn more .
while grace is saying , hood mine eyes thus with my hat , and sigh and say , “ propn use all the observance of civility like one well studied in a sad ostent to please his grandam , never trust me more .
well , we shall see your bearing .
nay , but i bar tonight .
you shall not gauge me by what we do tonight .
i would entreat you rather to put on your boldest suit of mirth , for we have friends that purpose merriment .
but fare you well .
i have some business .
i am sorry thou wilt leave my father so .
our house is hell , and thou , a merry devil , propn rob it of some taste of tediousness .
and launcelot , soon at supper shalt thou see propn , who is thy new master ’ s guest .
give him this letter .
propn !
if a propn do not play the knave and get thee , i am much deceived .
but adieu .
these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit .
propn .
propn , good launcelot .
propn , what heinous sin is it in me to be ashamed to be my father ’ s child !
but though i am a daughter to his blood , i am not to his manners .
o propn , if thou keep promise , i shall end this strife , become a propn and thy loving wife .
nay , we will slink away in supper time , disguise us at my lodging , and return , all in an hour .
we have not made good preparation .
we have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
propn vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , and better in my mind not undertook .
propn now but four o'clock .
we have two hours to furnish us .
friend propn , what ’ s the news ?
i know the hand .
love news , in faith ?
whither goest thou ?
marry , sir , to bid my old master the propn to sup tonight with my new master the propn .
and so will i .
meet me and propn at propn ’ s lodging some hour hence .
propn good we do so .
was not that letter from fair propn ?
some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper , and other of such vinegar aspect that they ’ ll not show their teeth in way of smile propn propn swear the jest be laughable .
fare ye well .
your worth is very dear in my regard .
i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace th ' occasion to depart .
good signors both , when shall we laugh ?
my propn propn , since you have found propn , we two will leave you .
i will not fail you .
i must needs tell thee all .
who bids thee call ?
i do not bid thee call .
your worship was wo nt to tell me that i could do nothing without bidding .
call you ?
what is your will ?
i am bid forth to supper , propn .
there are my keys .— but wherefore should i go ?
i am not bid for love .
they flatter me .
but yet i ’ ll go in hate to feed upon the prodigal propn .— propn , my girl , look to my house .
i am right loath to go .
there is some ill a - brewing towards my rest , for i did dream of money bags tonight .
i beseech you , sir , go .
my young master doth expect your reproach .
so do i his .
and they have conspired together .
i will not say you shall see a masque , but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a - bleeding on propn propn last at six o'clock i ' th ' morning falling out that year on propn propn was four year in th ' afternoon .
what , are there masques ?
but stop my house ’ s ears — i mean my casements— let not the sound of shallow foppery enter my sober house .
by propn ’ s staff , i swear , i have no mind of feasting forth tonight .
i will go before , propn propn , look out at window , for all this .
what says that fool of propn ’ s offspring , ha ?
his words were , “ propn , mistress . ” nothing else .
the patch is kind enough , but a huge feeder , propn - slow in profit , and he sleeps by day more than the wildcat .
drones hive not with me .
well , propn , go in .
perhaps i will return immediately .
do as i bid you .
shut doors after you .
fast bind , fast find .
propn , and if my fortune be not crost , i have a father , you a daughter , lost .
this is the penthouse under which propn desired us to make stand .
his hour is almost past .
and it is marvel he outdwells his hour , for lovers ever run before the clock .
oh , ten times faster propn ' pigeons fly to seal love ’ s bonds new made than they are wo nt to keep obligèd faith unforfeited .
that ever holds .
who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down ?
where is the horse that doth untread again his tedious measures with the unbated fire that he did pace them first ?
all things that are , are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed .
here comes propn .
more of this hereafter .
sweet friends , your patience for my long abode .
not i but my affairs have made you wait .
when you shall please to play the thieves for wives , i ’ ll watch as long for you then .
approach .
who ’ s within ?
who are you ?
tell me for more certainty , propn i ’ ll swear that i do know your tongue .
lorenzo , and thy love .
lorenzo certain , and my love indeed— for who love i so much ?
and now who knows but you , propn , whether i am yours ?
propn and thy thoughts are witness that thou art .
here , catch this casket .
it is worth the pains .
descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
what , must i hold a candle to my shames ?
i will make fast the doors and gild myself with some more ducats , and be with you straight .
now , by my hood , a gentle and no propn .
beshrew me but i love her heartily .
for she is wise , if i can judge of her .
and fair she is , if that mine eyes be true .
and true she is , as she hath proved herself .
and therefore , like herself — wise , fair and true— propn she be placèd in my constant soul .
what , art thou come ? — on , gentlemen , away !
our masquing mates by this time for us stay .
who ’ s there ?
propn propn ?
propn nine o'clock .
our friends all stay for you .
no masque tonight .
i have sent twenty out to seek for you .
i am glad on propn .
i desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight .
the one of them contains my picture , propn .
if you choose that , then i am yours withal .
some god direct my judgment !
let me see .
i will survey th ' inscriptions back again .
what says this leaden casket ?
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . ” must give — for what ?
for lead ?
hazard for lead ?
this casket threatens .
men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages .
a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross .
i ’ ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead .
what says the silver with her virgin hue ?
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . ” “ as much as he deserves ! ” —pause there , propn , and weigh thy value with an even hand .
what if i strayed no further , but chose here ?
let ’ s see once more this saying graved in gold , “ who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire . ” why , that ’ s the lady .
all the world desires her .
from the four corners of the earth they come to kiss this shrine , this mortal breathing saint .
the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds of wide propn are as thoroughfares now for princes to come view fair propn .
the watery kingdom , whose ambitious head spits in the face of propn , is no bar to stop the foreign spirits , but they come as propn a brook to see fair propn .
one of these three contains her heavenly picture .
is propn like that lead contains her ?
twere damnation to think so base a thought .
it were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave .
or shall i think in silver she ’ s immured , being ten times undervalued to tried gold ?
o sinful thought !
never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold .
they have in propn a coin that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold , but that ’ s insculped upon .
you look not well , propn propn .
you have too much respect upon the world .
and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans .
i ’ ll tell thee more of this another time .
but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon , this opinion.— come , good propn .— propn ye well awhile .
i ’ ll end my exhortation after dinner .
lies all within .— deliver me the key .
here do i choose , and thrive i as i may !
there , take it , propn .
o hell , what have we here ?
a carrion death , within whose empty eye there is a written scroll .
i ’ ll read the writing .
all that glisters is not gold— often have you heard that told .
many a man his life hath sold but my outside to behold .
gilded tombs do worms enfold .
had you been as wise as bold , young in limbs , in judgment old , your answer had not been inscrolled .
propn , adieu .
i have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave .
thus losers part .
a gentle riddance .— draw the curtains , go.— let all of his complexion choose me so .
why , man , i saw propn under sail .
with him is propn gone along .
and in their ship i am sure propn is not .
the villain propn with outcries raised the propn , who went with him to search propn ’ s ship .
he came too late .
the ship was under sail .
but there the propn was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together propn and his amorous propn .
besides , propn certified the propn they were not with propn in his ship .
i never heard a passion so confused , so strange , outrageous , and so variable , as the dog propn did utter in the streets .
o my daughter , fled with a propn !
o my christian ducats !
propn , find the girl !
she hath the stones upon her , and the ducats . ” why , all the boys in propn follow him , crying , “ his stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! ”
let good propn look he keep his day , or he shall pay for this .
marry , well remembered .
i reasoned with a propn yesterday , who told me , in the narrow seas that part the french and propn , there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught .
you were best to tell propn what you hear— yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
i saw propn and propn part .
propn told him he would make some speed of his return .
and for the propn ’ s bond which he hath of me , let it not enter in your mind of love .
and so they parted .
i think he only loves the world for him .
i pray thee , let us go and find him out and quicken his embracèd heaviness with some delight or other .
do we so .
draw the curtain straight .
the propn of propn hath ta'en his oath and comes to his election presently .
behold , there stand the caskets , noble propn .
if you choose that wherein i am contained , propn shall our nuptial rites be solemnized .
but if you fail , without more speech , my lord , you must be gone from hence immediately .
to these injunctions every one doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self .
and so have i addressed me .
propn now to my heart ’ s hope !
gold , silver , and base lead .
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . ” you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard .
what says the golden chest ?
ha , let me see .
so , with two seeming bodies but one heart , two of the first , like coats in heraldry , due but to one and crownèd with one crest .
and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend ?
it is not friendly , ’ tis not maidenly .
our sex , as well as i , may chide you for it , though i alone do feel the injury .
i scorn you not .
it seems that you scorn me .
have you not set propn , as in scorn , to follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
and made your other love , propn who even but now did spurn me with his foot— to call me goddess , nymph , divine , and rare , precious , celestial ?
wherefore speaks he this to her he hates ?
and wherefore doth propn deny your love , so rich within his soul , and tender me , forsooth , affection , but by your setting on , by your consent ?
what though i be not so in grace as propn so hung upon with love , so fortunate— but miserable most , to love unloved ?
this you should pity rather than despise .
i understand not what you mean by this .
ay , do .
persever , counterfeit sad looks , make mouths upon me when i turn my back , wink each at other , hold the sweet jest up— this sport , well carried , shall be chronicled .
if you have any pity , grace , or manners , you would not make me such an argument .
but fare ye well .
propn partly my own fault , which death or absence soon shall remedy .
stay , gentle propn .
hear my excuse .
my love , my life , my soul , fair propn !
oh , excellent !
thou canst compel no more than she entreat .
thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.— propn , i love thee .
by my life , i do .
i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not .
i say i love thee more than he can do .
if thou say so , withdraw and prove it too .
lysander , whereto tends all this ?
why are you grown so rude ?
thy love ?
out , tawny propn , out !
out , loathèd medicine !
o hated potion , hence !
do you not jest ?
yes , sooth , and so do you .
propn , i will keep my word with thee .
i would i had your bond , for i perceive a weak bond holds you .
i ’ ll not trust your word .
although i hate her , i ’ ll not harm her so .
ay , by my life , and never did desire to see thee more .
therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt .
be certain , nothing truer .
o me !
fine , i ' faith !
have you no modesty , no maiden shame , no touch of bashfulness ?
puppet ” ?
why so ? — ay , that way goes the game .
how low am i , thou painted maypole ?
speak .
how low am i ?
propn propn , do not be so bitter with me .
he followed you .
for love i followed him .
but he hath chid me hence and threatened me to strike me , spurn me — nay , to kill me too .
let me go .
you see how simple and how fond i am .
why , get you gone !
who is propn that hinders you ?
a foolish heart , that i leave here behind .
what , with propn ?
with propn .
be not afraid .
she shall not harm thee , propn .
she was a vixen when she went to school .
and though she be but little , she is fierce .
little ” again ?
nothing but “ low ” and “ little ” ! — why will you suffer her to flout me thus ?
let me come to her .
what cheer , my propn propn and propn , go along .
i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
with duty and desire we follow you .
how now , my love ?
why is your cheek so pale ?
how chance the roses there do fade so fast ?
propn for want of rain , which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
ay me !
for aught that i could ever read , could ever hear by tale or history , the course of true love never did run smooth .
but either it was different in blood—
let her alone .
speak not of propn .
take not her part .
for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her , propn shalt aby it .
now she holds me not .
now follow , if thou darest , to try whose right , of thine or mine , is most in propn .
follow ” ?
nay , i ’ ll go with thee , cheek by jowl .
you , mistress , all this coil is long of you .
nay , go not back .
i am amazed and know not what to say .
believe me , propn of propn , i mistook .
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garment he had on ?
and so far blameless proves my enterprise , that i have ' nointed an propn ’ s eyes .
and so far am i glad it so did sort , as this their jangling i esteem a sport .
thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight .
hie therefore , propn , overcast the night .
the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as propn , and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within another ’ s way .
my fairy lord , this must be done with haste .
but we are spirits of another sort .
i with the morning ’ s love have oft made sport , and like a forester the groves may tread even till the eastern gate , all fiery red , opening on propn with fair blessèd beams , turns into yellow gold his salt green streams .
but notwithstanding , haste .
make no delay .
we may effect this business yet ere day .
up and down , up and down , i will lead them up and down .
i am feared in field and town .
propn , lead them up and down .
here comes one .
where art thou , proud propn ?
speak thou now .
lysander , speak again !
thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ?
speak !
in some bush ?
where dost thou hide thy head ?
yea , art thou there ?
he goes before me and still dares me on .
when i come where he calls , then he is gone .
the villain is much lighter - heeled than propn i followed fast , but faster he did fly , that fallen am i in dark uneven way ,
and here will rest me .
where art thou now ?
nay , then , thou mock ’ st me .
thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see .
now go thy way .
o weary night , o long and tedious night , abate thy hours .
yet but three ?
come one more .
two of both kinds make up four .
here she comes , cursed and sad .
propn is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad .
here will i rest me till the break of day .
heavens shield propn if they mean a fray !
on the ground sleep sound .
where ’ s propn ?
ready .
scratch my head , propn .
where ’ s propn propn ?
ready .
do not fret yourself too much in the action , monsieur .
and good monsieur , have a care the honey bag break not .
i would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag , signor .
where ’ s propn propn ?
ready .
give me your neaf , propn propn .
pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
what ’ s your will ?
nothing , good monsieur , but to help propn propn to scratch .
i must to the barber ’ s , monsieur , for methinks i am marvelous hairy about the face .
and i am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , i must scratch .
what , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
i have a reasonable good ear in music .
let ’ s have the tongs and the bones .
or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
truly , a peck of provender .
i could munch your good dry oats .
methinks i have a great desire to a bottle of hay .
good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel ’ s hoard and fetch thee new nuts .
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
but , i pray you , let none of your people stir me .
i have an exposition of sleep come upon me .
sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms .
oh , how i love thee !
how i dote on thee !
welcome , good propn .
propn thou this sweet sight ?
her dotage now i do begin to pity .
for , meeting her of late behind the wood , seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool , i did upbraid her and fall out with her .
for she his hairy temples then had rounded with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers , and that same dew , which sometime on the buds was wo nt to swell like round and orient pearls , stood now within the pretty flowerets ' eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail .
and now i have the boy , i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes .
and , gentle propn , take this transformèd scalp from off the head of this athenian swain , that , he awaking when the other do , may all to propn back again repair and think no more of this night ’ s accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream .
but first i will release the fairy queen .
now , my propn , wake you , my sweet queen .
there lies your love .
how came these things to pass ?
oh , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now !
silence awhile .— propn , take off this propn propn , music call , and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense .
music , ho !
music such as charmeth sleep !
sound , music ! —come , my queen , take hands with me , and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be .
too old to be engaged to young .
or else it stood upon the choice of friends— o hell , to choose love by another ’ s eyes !
so quick bright things come to confusion .
if then true lovers have been ever crossed , it stands as an edict in destiny .
a good persuasion .
therefore , hear me , propn .
i have a widow aunt , a dowager of great revenue , and she hath no child .
from propn is her house remote seven leagues , and she respects me as her only son .
there , gentle propn , may i marry thee .
and to that place the sharp athenian law can not pursue us .
propn propn , attend , and mark .
i do hear the morning lark .
then , my queen , in silence sad , trip we after the night ’ s shade .
come , my lord , and in our flight tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground .
go , one of you , find out the forester .
uncouple in the western valley .
let them go .
propn , i say , and find the forester .
we will , fair queen , up to the mountain ’ s top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction .
i was with propn and propn once , when in a wood of propn they bayed the bear with hounds of propn .
the skies , the fountains , every region near seemed all one mutual cry .
i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
i wonder of their being here together .
but speak , propn .
is not this the day that propn should give answer of her choice ?
it is , my lord .
go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
good morrow , friends .
propn propn is past .
begin these woodbirds but to couple now ?
propn , my lord .
i pray you all , stand up .
my lord , i shall reply amazèdly , half sleep , half waking .
but as yet , i swear , i can not truly say how i came here .
but as i think — for truly would i speak , and now do i bethink me , so it is— i came with propn hither .
and all the faith , the virtue of my heart , the object and the pleasure of mine eye , is only propn .
to her , my lord , was i betrothed ere i saw propn .
fair lovers , you are fortunately met .
of this discourse we more will hear anon.— propn , i will overbear your will .
away with us to propn .
three and three , we ’ ll hold a feast in great solemnity .
are you sure that we are awake ?
it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream .
and he did bid us follow to the temple .
why then , we are awake .
it shall be called “ propn propn propn ” because it hath no bottom .
and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke .
propn , to make it the more gracious , i shall sing it at her death .
have you sent to propn ’ s house ?
is he come home yet ?
he can not be heard of .
out of doubt he is transported .
if he come not , then the play is marred .
it goes not forward .
doth it ?
it is not possible .
no , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in propn .
yea , and the best person too .
and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice .
you must say “ paragon . ” a “ paramour ” is , propn bless us , a thing of naught .
masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married .
if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
o sweet bully bottom !
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life .
he could not have ’ scaped sixpence a day .
an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing propn , i ’ ll be hanged .
he would have deserved it .
where are these hearts ?
bottom !
o most courageous day !
o most happy hour !
i will tell you everything , right as it fell out .
let us hear , sweet bottom .
not a word of me .
all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined .
get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps .
meet presently at the palace .
every man look propn his part .
and most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath .
and i do not doubt but to hear them say , “ it is a sweet comedy . ” no more words .
away , go away !
propn strange , my propn , that these lovers speak of .
i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys .
the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact .
but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigured so together , more witnesseth than fancy ’ s images and grows to something of great constancy , but , howsoever , strange and admirable .
here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth.— propn , gentle friends !
come now , what masques , what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after - supper and bedtime ?
where is our usual manager of mirth ?
what revels are in hand ?
propn propn .
here , mighty propn .
what masque , what music ?
how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight ?
keep promise , love .
look , here comes propn .
propn , fair propn !
whither away ?
call you me “ fair ” ?
that “ fair ” again unsay .
propn loves your fair .
o happy fair !
your eyes are lodestars , and your tongue ’ s sweet air more tunable than lark to shepherd ’ s ear when wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear .
were the world mine , propn being bated , the rest i ’ d give to be to you translated .
the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning , late deceased in beggary . ” that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony .
tedious ” and “ brief ” ?
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
how shall we find the concord of this discord ?
a play there is , my lord , some ten words long , which is as brief as i have known a play .
for in all the play there is not one word apt , one player fitted .
for propn therein doth kill himself .
which , when i saw rehearsed , i must confess , made mine eyes water — but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed .
what are they that do play it ?
and we will hear it .
no , my noble lord .
it is not for you .
i have heard it over , and it is nothing , nothing in the world— unless you can find sport in their intents , extremely stretched and conned with cru ' l pain to do you service .
i will hear that play .
go , bring them in .— and take your places , ladies .
why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
he says they can do nothing in this kind .
where i have come , great clerks have purposèd to greet me with premeditated welcomes , where i have seen them shiver and look pale , make periods in the midst of sentences , propn their practiced accent in their fears , and in conclusion dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome .
love , therefore , and tongue - tied simplicity in least speak most , to my capacity .
so please your grace , the propn is addressed .
let him approach .
if we offend , it is with our good will .
that you should think we come not to offend , but with good will .
consider then we come but in despite .
we do not come as minding to contest you , our true intent is .
all for your delight we are not here .
that you should here repent you , the actors are at hand , and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know .
this fellow doth not stand upon points .
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt .
he knows not the stop .
a good moral , my lord : it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
his speech was like a tangled chain .
who is next ?
i wonder if the lion be to speak .
no wonder , my lord .
would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse , my lord .
propn draws near the wall .
silence !
i fear my propn ’ s promise is propn and thou , o propn , o sweet , o lovely propn , that stand ’ st between her father ’ s ground and mine .
jove shield thee well for this !
but what see i ?
no propn do i see .
o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss !
cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
i see a voice .
now will i to the chink , to spy an i can hear my propn ’ s face .
thisbe ?
my love thou art , my love , i think .
think what thou wilt , i am thy lover ’ s grace .
propn thou at propn ’ s tomb meet me straightway ?
tide life , tide death , i come without delay .
thus have i , propn , my part dischargèd so .
and , being done , thus propn away doth go .
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard .
the best in this kind are but shadows , and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them .
it must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
a very gentle beast , of a good conscience .
this lion is a very fox , for his valor .
true .
and a goose for his discretion .
not so , my lord .
for his valor can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
his discretion , i am sure , can not carry his valor , for the goose carries not the fox .
it is well .
leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present .
myself the man i ' th ' moon do seem to be— this is the greatest error of all the rest .
the man should be put into the lanthorn .
how is it else the “ man i ' th ' moon ” ?
he dares not come there for the candle .
for you see , it is already in snuff .
i am aweary of this moon .
propn , propn .
all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon ; i , the man in the moon ; this thornbush , my thornbush ; and this dog , my dog .
why , all these should be in the lanthorn , for all these are in the moon .— but silence !
here comes propn .
this is old propn ’ s tomb .
where is my love ?
well roared , propn !
well run , propn !
well shone , propn , the moon shines with a good grace .
well moused , propn !
o , teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of propn ' heart .
i frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
oh , that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !
i give him curses , yet he gives me love .
oh , that my prayers could such affection move !
the more i hate , the more he follows me .
the more i love , the more he hateth me .
his folly , propn , is no fault of mine .
none , but your beauty .
would that fault were mine !
take comfort .
he no more shall see my face .
lysander and myself will fly this place .
before the time i did propn see seemed propn as a paradise to me .
oh , then , what graces in my love do dwell , that he hath turned a heaven unto a hell !
propn , to you our minds we will unfold .
tomorrow night when propn doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass , decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass ( a time that lovers ' flights doth still conceal ) , through propn ' gates have we devised to steal .
and then came propn .
and so the lion vanished .
propn propn , i thank thee for thy sunny beams .
but mark , poor knight , what dreadful dole is here !
eyes , do you see ?
how can it be ?
o dainty duck !
o dear !
o fates , come , come , propn thread and thrum .
propn , crush , conclude , and quell !
o wherefore , nature , didst thou lions frame ?
thus die i , thus , thus , thus .
now am i dead .
now die , die , die , die , die .
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .
methinks she should not use a long one for such a propn .
i hope she will be brief .
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
and thus she means , propn propn , my love ?
what , dead , my dove ?
o propn , arise !
speak , speak .
quite dumb ?
dead , dead ?
a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes .
these lily lips , this cherry nose , these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone , are gone .
lovers , make moan .
his eyes were green as leeks .
o propn three , come , come to me with hands as pale as milk .
lay them in gore , since you have shore with shears his thread of silk .
tongue , not a word .
come , trusty sword .
come , blade , my breast imbrue .
moonshine and propn are left to bury the dead .
ay , and propn too .
no epilogue , i pray you , for your play needs no excuse .
never excuse — for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed .
marry , if he that writ it had played propn and hanged himself in propn ’ s garter , it would have been a fine tragedy .
and so it is , truly , and very notably discharged .
but come , your bergomask .
let your epilogue alone .
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve .
lovers , to bed .
propn almost fairy time .
sweet friends , to bed .
through the house give glimmering light , by the dead and drowsy fire .
first , rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note .
hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place .
if you pardon , we will mend .
and , as i am an honest propn , if we have unearnèd luck now to ’ scape the serpent ’ s tongue , we will make amends ere long .
else the propn a liar call .
so good night unto you all .
give me your hands if we be friends , and propn shall restore amends .
there my propn and myself shall meet .
and thence from propn turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies .
propn , sweet playfellow .
we must starve our sight from lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
i will , my propn .
propn , adieu .
as you on him , propn dote on you !
but what of that ?
propn thinks not so .
he will not know what all but he do know .
things base and vile , holding no quantity , propn can transpose to form and dignity .
love looks not with the eyes but with the mind .
and therefore is winged propn painted blind .
nor propn propn ’ s mind of any judgment propn propn and no eyes figure unheedy haste .
and therefore is love said to be a child , because in choice he is so oft beguiled .
then to the wood will he tomorrow night propn her .
is all our company here ?
first , good propn propn , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .
answer as i call you .— propn propn , the weaver ?
ready .
name what part i am for and proceed .
you , propn propn , are set down for propn .
what is propn ?
i will condole in some measure .— to the rest .— yet my chief humor is for a tyrant .
i could play propn rarely , or a part to tear a cat in to make all split .
a lover is more condoling .
propn propn , the bellows - mender ?
here , propn propn .
what is propn ?
a wandering knight ?
it is the lady that propn must love .
nay , faith , let me not play a woman .
i have a beard coming .
that ’ s all one .
you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
an i may hide my face , let me play propn too !
you must play propn .— and propn , you propn .
propn propn , the tailor ?
here , propn propn .
propn propn , you must play propn ’ s mother .— propn propn , the tinker ?
here , propn propn .
you , propn ' father .— myself , propn ’ s father .— snug the joiner , you , the lion ’ s part .— and i hope here is a play fitted .
have you the lion ’ s part written ?
pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study .
let me play the lion too .
and that were enough to hang us all .
that would hang us , every mother ’ s son .
i grant you , friends , if you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us .
for propn is a sweet - faced man , a proper man as one shall see in a summer ’ s day , a most lovely , gentlemanlike man .
therefore you must needs play propn .
well , i will undertake it .
what beard were i best to play it in ?
why , what you will .
four days will quickly steep themselves in night .
four nights will quickly dream away the time .
and then the moon , like to a silver bow propn bent in propn , shall behold the night of our solemnities .
turn melancholy forth to funerals .
the pale companion is not for our pomp .
but i will we d thee in another key , with pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .
happy be propn , our renownèd duke .
i will discharge it in either your straw - color beard , your orange - tawny beard , your purple - in - grain beard , or your french crown - color beard , your perfect yellow .
there will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known .
in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants .
i pray you , fail me not .
we will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
propn .
at the duke ’ s oak we meet .
enough .
hold , or cut bowstrings .
how now , spirit ?
propn wander you ?
over hill , over dale , thorough bush , thorough brier , over park , over pale , thorough flood , thorough fire .
i do wander everywhere propn than the moon ’ s sphere .
and i serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green .
the cowslips tall her pensioners be .
in those freckles live their savors .
i must go seek some dewdrops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip ’ s ear .
propn , thou lob of spirits .
i ’ ll be gone .
our queen and all our elves come here anon .
for propn is passing fell and wrath because that she , as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king .
and jealous propn would have the child propn of his train , to trace the forests wild .
but she perforce withholds the lovèd boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy .
those that “ propn ” call you , and “ sweet propn , ” you do their work , and they shall have good luck .
are not you he ?
thou speak ’ st aright .
i am that merry wanderer of the night .
and sometime lurk i in a gossip ’ s bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab , and when she drinks , against her lips i bob and on her withered dewlap pour the ale .
then slip i from her bum , down topples she , and “ propn ! ” cries , and falls into a cough , and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh , and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there .
but , room , fairy !
here comes propn .
and here my mistress .
would that he were gone !
what , jealous propn ? — fairies , skip hence .
i have forsworn his bed and company .
tarry , rash wanton .
why art thou here , come from the farthest step of propn ?
but that , forsooth , the bouncing propn , your buskined mistress and your warrior love , to propn must be wedded , and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity .
how canst thou thus for shame , propn , propn i know thy love to propn ?
glance at my credit with propn , propn thou not lead him through the glimmering night from propn , whom he ravishèd ?
and make him with fair propn break his faith , with propn and propn ?
these are the forgeries of jealousy .
and never , since the middle summer ’ s spring , propn we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , by pavèd fountain , or by rushy brook , or in the beachèd margent of the sea , to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , but with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport .
therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs , which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents .
the ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , the ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn propn rotted ere his youth attained a beard .
the fold stands empty in the drownèd field , and crows are fatted with the murrain flock .
therefore the moon , the governess of floods , propn in her anger , washes all the air , that rheumatic diseases do abound .
the spring , the summer , the childing autumn , angry winter change their wonted liveries , and the mazèd world , by their increase , now knows not which is which .
and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate , from our dissension .
we are their parents and original .
do you amend it then .
it lies in you .
why should propn cross her propn ?
i do but beg a little changeling boy , to be my henchman .
set your heart at rest .
the propn buys not the child of me .
how long within this wood intend you stay ?
perchance till after propn ' wedding day .
if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels , go with us .
if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts .
give me that boy and i will go with thee .
not for thy fairy kingdom .— fairies , away !
we shall chide downright , if i longer stay .
well , go thy way .
thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury.— my gentle propn , come hither .
i remember .
that very time i saw ( but thou couldst not ) flying between the cold moon and the propn , propn all armed .
a certain aim he took at a fair vestal thronèd by the west , and loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts .
but i might see young propn ’ s fiery shaft quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon , and the imperial votaress passèd on , in maiden meditation , fancy - free .
yet marked i where the bolt of propn fell .
it fell upon a little western flower , before milk - white , now purple with love ’ s wound .
and maidens call it “ love - in - idleness . ” fetch me that flower .
the herb i showed thee once .
the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees .
fetch me this herb , and be thou here again propn the leviathan can swim a league .
i ’ ll put a girdle round about the propn in forty minutes .
having once this juice , i ’ ll watch propn when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes .
the next thing then she waking looks upon— be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , on meddling monkey or on busy ape— she shall pursue it with the soul of love .
and ere i take this charm from of her sight— as i can take it with another herb— i ’ ll make her render up her page to me .
but who comes here ?
i love thee not , therefore pursue me not .
where is propn and fair hermia ?
the one i ’ ll stay , the other stayeth me .
thou told ’ st me they were stol'n unto this wood .
and here am i , and wood within this wood , because i can not meet my propn .
hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
you draw me , you hard - hearted adamant .
but yet you draw not iron , for my heart is true as steel .
leave you your power to draw , and i shall have no power to follow you .
do i entice you ?
do i speak you fair ?
or rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i can not , love you ?
and even for that do i love you the more .
i am your spaniel .
and , propn , the more you beat me , i will fawn on you .
use me but as your spaniel — spurn me , strike me , neglect me , lose me .
only give me leave , propn as i am , to follow you .
for i am sick when i do look on thee .
and i am sick when i look not on you .
your virtue is my privilege .
nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , for you in my respect are all the world .
then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me ?
i ’ ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
the wildest hath not such a heart as you .
let me go .
or if thou follow me , do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood .
ay , in the temple , in the town , the field you do me mischief .
propn , propn !
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex .
we can not fight for love as men may do .
i ’ ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , to die upon the hand i love so well .
fare thee well , nymph .
propn he do leave this grove , propn shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love .
propn thou the flower there ?
welcome , wanderer .
ay , there it is .
i pray thee , give it me .
thanks , good propn .
what ’ s the news with thee ?
full of vexation come i with complaint against my child , my daughter propn stand forth , propn .— my noble lord , this man hath my consent to marry propn stand forth , propn .— and my gracious duke , this man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.— thou , thou , propn , thou hast given her rhymes , and interchanged love tokens with my child .
thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love , and stol'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair , rings , gauds , conceits , propn , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats — messengers of strong prevailment in unhardened youth .
with cunning hast thou filched my daughter ’ s heart , turned her obedience ( which is due to me ) to stubborn harshness .— and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace propn to marry with propn , i beg the ancient privilege of propn .
as she is mine , i may dispose of her— which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death — according to our law immediately provided in that case .
what say you , propn ?
propn is a worthy gentleman .
there sleeps propn sometime of the night , lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .
and there the snake throws her enameled skin , propn wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
and with the juice of this i ’ ll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies .
fear not , my lord .
your servant shall do so .
hence , away !
now all is well .
one aloof stand sentinel .
what thou seest when thou dost wake , do it for thy true love take .
wake when some vile thing is near .
be it so , propn .
find you out a bed , for i upon this bank will rest my head .
one heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .
nay , good propn .
do not lie so near .
i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it .
then by your side no bed room me deny .
and , good night , sweet friend .
thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end !
amen , amen to that fair prayer , say i .
here is my bed .
pretty soul !
stay , though thou kill me , sweet propn .
i charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
o , wilt thou darkling leave me ?
do not so .
stay , on thy peril .
i alone will go .
oh , i am out of breath in this fond chase .
the more my prayer , the lesser is my grace .
happy is propn , wheresoe'er she lies , for she hath blessèd and attractive eyes .
how came her eyes so bright ?
not with salt tears .
if so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers .
no , no , i am as ugly as a bear , for beasts that meet me run away for fear .
therefore no marvel though propn propn , as a monster , fly my presence thus .
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with propn ’ s sphery eyne ?
do not say so , propn .
say not so .
what though he love your hermia ?
propn , what though ?
content with propn ?
no .
i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent .
not propn but propn i love .
things growing are not ripe until their season .
so i , being young , till now ripe not to reason .
is ’ t not enough , is propn not enough , young man , that i did never , no , nor never can , deserve a sweet look from propn ' eye , but you must flout my insufficiency ?
good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , in such disdainful manner me to woo .
but fare you well .
perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness .
oh , that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused !
are we all met ?
propn , pat .
and here ’ s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .
this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn - brake our tiring - house , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
propn quince— what sayest thou , bully bottom ?
there are things in this comedy of propn and propn that will never please .
first , propn must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies can not abide .
how answer you that ?
i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
not a whit .
i have a device to make all well .
write me a prologue , and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords , and that propn is not killed indeed .
and for the more better assurance , tell them that i , propn , am not propn , but bottom the weaver .
this will put them out of fear .
well .
we will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
no , make it two more .
let it be written in eight and eight .
will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
i fear it , i promise you .
for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living .
therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .
nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion ’ s neck .
for , you know , propn and propn meet by moonlight .
so is propn .
in himself he is .
but in this kind , wanting your father ’ s voice , the other must be held the worthier .
i would my father looked but with my eyes .
rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
i do entreat your grace to pardon me .
i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts , but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case , if i refuse to we d propn .
therefore , fair propn , question your desires .
know of your youth .
doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?
a calendar , a calendar !
look in the almanac .
find out moonshine , find out moonshine !
what say you , bottom ?
and let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall propn and propn whisper .
if that may be then all is well .
come , sit down , every mother ’ s son , and rehearse your parts .— propn , you begin .
when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake .— and so everyone according to his cue .
speak , propn .— propn , stand forth .
ay , marry , must you .
for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .
propn ' tomb , ” man .
why , you must not speak that yet .
you speak all your part at once , cues and all .— propn , enter .
it is “ never tire . ” oh .
oh , monstrous !
oh , strange !
we are haunted .
fly , masters !
i ’ ll follow you .
sometime a horse i ’ ll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire .
and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .
why do they run away ?
o bottom , thou art changed !
what do i see on thee ?
what do you see ?
you see an ass head of your own , do you ?
bless thee , bottom , bless thee .
thou art translated .
but i will not stir from this place , do what they can .
i will walk up and down here and i will sing , that they shall hear i am not afraid .
for indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ?
methinks , mistress , you should have little reason for that .
and yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays .
the more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends .
thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
not so , neither .
but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood , i have enough to serve mine own turn .
i am a spirit of no common rate .
therefore go with me .
and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— propn , propn , propn , and propn !
ready .
and i .
and i .
and i .
where shall we go ?
be kind and courteous to this gentleman .
propn in his walks and gambol in his eyes .
feed him with apricoks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes .
nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
propn , mortal .
propn .
propn .
propn .
i cry your worships ' mercy , heartily .— i beseech your worship ’ s name .
propn .
i shall desire you of more acquaintance , good propn propn .
if i cut my finger , i shall make bold with propn your name , honest gentleman ?
propn .
i pray you , commend me to propn propn , your mother , and to propn propn , your father .
propn propn propn , i shall desire you of more acquaintance too.— your name , i beseech you , sir ?
propn .
propn propn propn , i know your patience well .
that same cowardly , giantlike ox - beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house .
i promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .
i desire you of more acquaintance , good propn propn .
come , wait upon him .
lead him to my bower .
the moon methinks looks with a watery eye .
and when she weeps , weeps every little flower , lamenting some enforcèd chastity .
tie up my love ’ s tongue .
bring him silently .
here comes my messenger .— how now , mad spirit ?
what night - rule now about this haunted grove ?
my mistress with a monster is in love .
i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet propn translated there .
when in that moment so it came to pass , propn waked and straightway loved an ass .
this falls out better than i could devise .
but hast thou yet latched the propn ’ s eyes with the love juice , as i did bid thee do ?
i took him sleeping — that is finished too— and the athenian woman by his side , that , when he waked , of force she must be eyed .
oh , why rebuke you him that loves you so ?
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
if thou hast slain propn in his sleep , being o'er shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , and kill me too .
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me .
would he have stolen away from sleeping propn ?
it can not be but thou hast murdered him .
so should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
so should the murdered look , and so should i , pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty .
yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , as yonder propn in her glimmering sphere .
what ’ s this to my lysander ?
where is he ?
ah , good propn , wilt thou give him me ?
propn thou slain him then ?
o brave touch !
could not a worm , an adder , do so much ?
an adder did it , for with doubler tongue than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
i am not guilty of propn ’ s blood .
nor is he dead , for aught that i can tell .
i pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
an if i could , what should i get therefore ?
propn , sweet propn — and , propn , yield propn crazèd title to my certain right .
you have her father ’ s love , propn .
and she is mine , and all my right of her i do estate unto propn .
a privilege never to see me more .
and from thy hated presence part i so .
see me no more , whether he be dead or no .
here therefore for a while i will remain .
and laid the love juice on some true love ’ s sight .
about the wood go swifter than the wind , and propn of propn look thou find— all fancy - sick she is and pale of cheer , with sighs of love , that costs the fresh blood dear .
flower of this purple dye , hit with propn propn archery , propn in apple of his eye .
when thou wakest , if she be by , propn of her for remedy .
shall we their fond pageant see ?
propn , what fools these mortals be !
stand aside .
the noise they make will cause propn to awake .
then will two at once woo one .
why should you think that i should woo in scorn ?
look , when i vow , i weep .
how can these things in me seem scorn to you , bearing the badge of faith to prove them true ?
you do advance your cunning more and more .
will you give her o'er ?
propn loves her , and he loves not you .
crystal is muddy .
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment .
you are unkind , propn .
be not so .
and yours of propn to me bequeath , whom i do love and will do till my death .
propn , keep thy propn .
i will none .
propn , it is not so .
look , where thy love comes .
dark night , that from the eye his function takes , the ear more quick of apprehension makes .
thou art not by mine eye , propn , found .
mine ear , i thank it , brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
why should he stay , whom love doth press to go ?
what love could press propn from my side ?
propn ’ s love , that would not let him bide , propn propn , who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light .
why seek ’ st thou me ?
could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so ?
you speak not as you think .
it can not be .
propn , she is one of this confederacy !
now i perceive they have conjoined all three to fashion this false sport , in spite of me.— propn propn !
is all the counsel that we two have shared , the sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty - footed time for parting us — oh , is it all forgot ?
all schooldays ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
we , propn , like two artificial gods , have with our needles created both one flower , both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , both warbling of one song , both in one key , as if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , had been incorporate .
so we grew together , like to a double cherry — seeming parted but yet an union in partition— two lovely berries molded on one stem ;
disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes , misprizing what they look on , and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak .
she can not love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self - endeared .
sure , i think so , and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love , lest she make sport at it .
why , you speak truth .
so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth .
but who dare tell her so ?
if i should speak , she would mock me into air .
o , she would laugh me out of myself , press me to death with wit .
therefore let propn , like covered fire , consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .
it were a better death than die with mocks , which is as bad as die with tickling .
no , rather i will go to propn and counsel him to fight against his passion ; and truly i ’ ll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with .
one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking .
o , do not do your cousin such a wrong !
she can not be so much without true judgment , having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to have , as to refuse so rare a gentleman as propn propn .
he is the only man of propn , always excepted my dear propn .
indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
his excellence did earn it , ere he had it .
when are you married , madam ?
why , every day , tomorrow .
come , go in .
i do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go i toward propn .
i ’ ll bring you thither , my lord , if you ’ ll vouchsafe me .
nay , that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it .
i will only be bold with propn for his company , for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth .
he hath twice or thrice cut propn ’ s bow - string , and the little hangman dare not shoot at him .
he hath a heart as sound as a bell , and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
gallants , i am not as i have been .
so say i. propn you are sadder .
i hope he be in love .
there ’ s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love .
if he be sad , he wants money .
what , sigh for the toothache ?
yet say i , he is in love .
unless he have a fancy to this foolery , as it appears he hath , he is no fool for fancy , as you would have it appear he is .
if he be not in love with some woman , there is no believing old signs .
he brushes his hat o ' mornings .
what should that bode ?
hath any man seen him at the barber propn ?
no , but the barber ’ s man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls .
nay , he rubs himself with civet .
can you smell him out by that ?
you embrace your charge too willingly .
her mother hath many times told me so .
you have it full , propn .
truly , the lady fathers herself .— be happy , lady , for you are like an honorable father .
if propn propn be her father , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all propn , as like him as she is .
i wonder that you will still be talking , propn propn .
nobody marks you .
what , my dear propn propn !
are you yet living ?
that ’ s as much as to say , the sweet youth propn in love .
the greatest note of it is his melancholy .
and when was he wo nt to wash his face ?
yea , or to paint himself ?
for the which i hear what they say of him .
nay , but his jesting spirit , which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by propn indeed , that tells a heavy tale for him .
propn , conclude , he is in love .
nay , but i know who loves him .
she shall be buried with her face upwards .
yet is this no charm for the toothache .— propn propn , walk aside with me .
propn even so .
my lord and brother , propn save you .
good e'en , brother .
if your leisure served , i would speak with you .
in private ?
if it please you .
yet propn propn may hear , for what i would speak of concerns him .
what ’ s the matter ?
you know he does .
i know not that , when he knows what i know .
if there be any impediment , i pray you discover it .
you may think i love you not .
let that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that i now will manifest .
for my brother , i think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage — surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
i came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a - talking of , the lady is disloyal .
who , propn ?
even she : propn ’ s propn , your propn , every man propn propn .
disloyal ?
the word is too good to paint out her wickedness .
i could say she were worse .
think you of a worse title , and i will fit her to it .
wonder not till further warrant .
go but with me tonight , you shall see her chamber window entered , even the night before her wedding day .
if you love her then , tomorrow we d her .
but it would better fit your honor to change your mind .
i will not think it .
if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her , tomorrow in the congregation , where i should we d , there will i shame her .
and as i wooed for thee to obtain her , i will join with thee to disgrace her .
bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .
o day untowardly turned !
o mischief strangely thwarting !
o plague right well prevented !
so will you say when you have seen the sequel .
are you good men and true ?
come hither , neighbor propn .
propn hath blessed you with a good name .
to be a well - favored man is the gift of fortune , but to write and read comes by nature .
both which , propn propn you have .
i knew it would be your answer .
well , for your favor , sir , why , give propn thanks , and make no boast of it , and for your writing and reading , let that appear when there is no need of such vanity .
you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch ; therefore bear you the lantern .
how if he will not stand ?
why , then , take no note of him , but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank propn you are rid of a knave .
if he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the propn ’ s subjects .
we know what belongs to a watch .
why , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for i can not see how sleeping should offend .
well , you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed .
how if they will not ?
why , then , let them alone till they are sober .
if they make you not then the better answer , you may say they are not the men you took them for .
well , sir .
if we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him ?
you , constable , are to present the propn ’ s own person .
if you meet the propn in the night , you may stay him .
nay , by ' propn propn , that i think he can not .
five shillings to one on propn , with any man that knows the statutes , he may stay him — marry , not without the propn be willing , for indeed the watch ought to offend no man , and it is an offense to stay a man against his will .
by ' r lady , i think it be so .
an there be any matter of weight chances , call up me .
well , masters , we hear our charge .
let us go sit here upon the church bench till two , and then all to bed .
one word more , honest neighbors .
i pray you watch about propn propn ’ s door , for the wedding being there tomorrow , there is a great coil tonight .
propn , be vigitant , i beseech you .
what propn !
propn , i say !
mass , and my elbow itched , i thought there would a scab follow .
i will owe thee an answer for that .
and now forward with thy tale .
stand thee close , then , under this penthouse , for it drizzles rain , and i will , like a true drunkard , utter all to thee .
therefore know i have earned of propn propn a thousand ducats .
is it possible that any villainy should be so dear ?
thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich .
for when rich villains have need of poor ones , poor ones may make what price they will .
i wonder at it .
that shows thou art unconfirmed .
thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet , or a hat , or a cloak , is nothing to a man .
yes , it is apparel .
yes , the fashion is the fashion .
tush , i may as well say the fool ’ s the fool .
propn thou not hear somebody ?
no , ’ twas the vane on the house .
but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too , that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion ?
not so , neither .
but know that i have tonight wooed propn , the propn propn ’ s gentlewoman , by the name of propn .
i should first tell thee how the propn , propn and my master , planted and placed and possessed by my master propn propn , saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter .
then is courtesy a turncoat .
but it is certain i am loved of all ladies , only you excepted .
and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart , for truly i love none .
a dear happiness to women .
they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor .
i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .
propn keep your ladyship still in that mind , so some gentle- man or other shall ’ scape a predestinate scratched face .
scratching could not make it worse an ’ twere such a face as yours were .
well , you are a rare parrot - teacher .
a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours .
i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer .
i have done .
you always end with a jade ’ s trick .
i know you of old .
that is the sum of all , propn .— propn propn and propn propn , my dear friend propn hath invited you all .
i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer .
i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .
and thought they propn was propn ?
we charge you , in the propn ’ s name , stand !
call up the right propn propn .
we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .
and one deformed is one of them .
i know him ; he wears a lock .
masters , masters— warrant you .
masters , never speak , we charge you , let us obey you go with us .
a commodity in question , i warrant you .— come , we ’ ll obey you .
propn propn , wake my cousin propn and desire her to rise .
i will , lady .
and bid her come hither .
well .
propn , i think your other rebato were better .
no , pray thee , good propn , i ’ ll wear this .
by my troth , ’ s not so good , and i warrant your cousin will say so .
my cousin ’ s a fool , and thou art another .
i ’ ll wear none but this .
i like the new tire within excellently , if the hair were a thought browner ; and your gown ’ s a most rare fashion , i ' faith .
i saw the propn of propn ’ s gown that they praise so .
oh , that exceeds , they say .
but for a fine , quaint , graceful , and excellent fashion , yours is worth ten on propn .
propn give me joy to wear it , for my heart is exceeding heavy .
propn be heavier soon by the weight of a man .
of what , lady ?
is not marriage honorable in a beggar ?
is not your lord honorable without marriage ?
good morrow , sweet propn .
why , how now ?
do you speak in the sick tune ?
i am out of all other tune , methinks .
do you sing it , and i ’ ll dance it .
o illegitimate construction !
these gloves the propn sent me , they are an excellent perfume .
i am stuffed , cousin .
even since you left it .
doth not my wit become me rarely ?
it is not seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap .
by my troth , i am sick .
i meant plain holy thistle .
you may think perchance that i think you are in love .
nay , by ' propn propn , i am not such a fool to think what i list , nor i list not to think what i can , nor indeed i can not think , if i would think my heart out of thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love .
yet propn was such another , and now is he become a man .
he swore he would never marry , and yet now , in despite of his heart , he eats his meat without grudging .
and how you may be converted i know not , but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do .
not a false gallop .
propn , withdraw : the propn , the propn , propn propn , propn propn , and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church .
help to dress me , good coz , good propn , good propn .
what would you with me , honest neighbor ?
marry , this it is , sir .
yes , in truth it is , sir .
what is it , my good friends ?
propn propn , sir , speaks a little off the matter .
it pleases your worship to say so , but we are the poor duke ’ s officers .
but truly , for mine own part , if i were as tedious as a king , i could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship .
all thy tediousness on me , ah ?
propn , an ’ twere a thousand pound more than ’ tis , for i hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city , and though i be but a poor man , i am glad to hear it .
gifts that propn gives .
i must leave you .
one word , sir .
take their examination yourself and bring it me .
i am now in great haste , as it may appear unto you .
fare you well .
my lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .
i am ready .
go , good partner , go , get you to propn propn .
bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail .
we will spare for no wit , i warrant you .
here ’ s that shall drive some of them to a noncome .
if you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn .
i thank you .
i am not of many words , but i thank you .
please it your propn lead on ?
your hand , propn .
we will go together .
propn , didst thou note the daughter of propn propn ?
i noted her not , but i looked on her .
is she not a modest young lady ?
do you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ?
or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ?
no , i pray thee speak in sober judgment .
why , i ' faith , methinks she ’ s too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise .
only this commendation i can afford her , that were she other than she is , she were unhandsome , and being no other but as she is , i do not like her .
thou thinkest i am in sport .
i pray thee tell me truly how thou propn her .
come , propn propn , be brief , only to the plain form of marriage , and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards .
no .
propn , you come hither to be married to this count ?
i do .
if either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you on your souls to utter it .
know you any , propn ?
none , my lord .
know you any , count ?
i dare make his answer , none .
o , what men dare do !
what men may do !
what men daily do , not knowing what they do !
how now , interjections ?
why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !
as freely , son , as propn did give her me .
and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?
nothing , unless you render her again .
propn propn , you learn me noble thankfulness.— there , propn , take her back again .
she ’ s but the sign and semblance of her honor .
behold how like a maid she blushes here !
oh , what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal !
comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue ?
would you not swear , all you that see her , that she were a maid by these exterior shows ?
but she is none .
she knows the heat of a luxurious bed .
her blush is guiltiness , not modesty .
what do you mean , my lord ?
dear my lord , if you in your own proof have vanquished the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity— i know what you would say : if i have known her , you will say she did embrace me as a husband , and so extenuate the forehand sin .
and seemed i ever otherwise to you ?
out on thee , seeming !
is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?
propn propn , why speak not you ?
what should i speak ?
i stand dishonored , that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale .
are these things spoken , or do i but dream ?
propn , they are spoken , and these things are true .
this looks not like a nuptial .
true !
o propn !
propn , stand i here ?
is this the propn ?
is this the propn ’ s brother ?
is this face propn propn ?
are our eyes our own ?
all this is so , but what of this , my lord ?
let me but move one question to your daughter , and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her , bid her answer truly .
i charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
oh , propn defend me !
how am i beset ! — what kind of catechizing call you this ?
to make you answer truly to your name .
is it not propn ?
who can blot that name with any just reproach ?
marry , that can propn !
hero itself can blot out propn ’ s virtue .
what man was he talked with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one ?
now , if you are a maid , answer to this .
i talked with no man at that hour , my lord .
upon mine honor , myself , my brother , and this grievèd count did see her , hear her , at that hour last night propn with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed , most like a liberal villain , confessed the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret .
there is not chastity enough in language , without offense , to utter them .— thus , pretty lady , i am sorry for thy much misgovernment .
why , how now , cousin !
wherefore sink you down ?
come , let us go .
these things , come thus to light , smother her spirits up .
how doth the lady ?
dead , i think .— help , propn propn , why , propn !
propn !
propn propn !
propn !
death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wished for .
how now , cousin propn !
yea , wherefore should she not ?
wherefore !
why , doth not every earthly thing propn shame upon her ?
grieved i i had but one ?
propn i for that at frugal propn ’ s frame ?
o , one too much by thee !
why had i one ?
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar ’ s issue at my gates , who , smirchèd thus , and mired with infamy , i might have said , “ no part of it is mine ; this shame derives itself from unknown loins ” ?
propn , sir , be patient .
for my part , i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say .
oh , on my soul , my cousin is belied !
propn , were you her bedfellow last night ?
no , truly not , although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
confirmed , confirmed !
i have marked a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face , a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes , and in her eye there hath appeared a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth .
propn , it can not be .
thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury .
there is some strange misprision in the princes .
two of them have the very bent of honor , and if their wisdoms be misled in this , the practice of it lives in propn the propn , whose spirits toil in frame of villainies .
i know not .
if they speak but truth of her , these hands shall tear her ; if they wrong her honor , the proudest of them shall well hear of it .
propn hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find , awaked in such a kind , both strength of limb and policy of mind , ability in means and choice of friends , to quit me of them throughly .
pause awhile , and let my counsel sway you in this case .
your daughter here the princes left for dead .
let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed .
maintain a mourning ostentation , and on your family ’ s old monument propn mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial .
what shall become of this ?
what will this do ?
that is some good .
she , dying , as it must so be maintained , upon the instant that she was accused , propn be lamented , pitied and excused of every hearer .
so will it fare with propn .
but if all aim but this be leveled false , the supposition of the lady ’ s death will quench the wonder of her infamy .
and if it sort not well , you may conceal her , as best befits her wounded reputation , in some reclusive and religious life , out of all eyes , tongues , minds , and injuries .
propn propn , let the friar advise you .
and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the propn and propn , yet , by mine honor , i will deal in this propn secretly and justly as your soul should with your body .
would you buy her , that you enquire after her ?
but speak you this with a sad brow ?
or do you play the flouting jack , to tell us propn is a good hare - finder and propn a rare carpenter ?
come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?
in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on .
i can see yet without spectacles , and i see no such matter .
but i hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you ?
i would scarce trust myself , though i had sworn the contrary , if propn would be my wife .
is propn come to this ?
in faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ?
look , propn propn is returned to seek you .
propn well consented .
presently away , for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.— come , lady , die to live .
this wedding day perhaps is but prolonged .
have patience and endure .
propn propn , have you wept all this while ?
yea , and i will weep a while longer .
i will not desire that .
surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
is there any way to show such friendship ?
a very even way , but no such friend .
may a man do it ?
it is a man ’ s office , but not yours .
i do love nothing in the world so well as you .
is not that strange ?
as strange as the thing i know not .
i am sorry for my cousin .
by my sword , propn , thou lovest me .
with no sauce that can be devised to it .
i protest i love thee .
why then , propn forgive me .
what offense , sweet beatrice ?
you have stayed me in a happy hour .
i was about to protest i loved you .
and do it with all thy heart .
i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
come , bid me do anything for thee .
propn propn .
ha !
not for the wide world .
you kill me to deny it .
tarry , sweet propn .
i am gone , though i am here .
there is no love in you .
nay , i pray you let me go .
propn in faith , i will go .
we ’ ll be friends first .
you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
is propn thine enemy ?
is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonored my kinswoman ?
oh , that i were a man !
what , bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancor — o propn , that i were a man !
i would eat his heart in the marketplace .
hear me , propn propn with a man out at a window !
a proper saying !
nay , but propn propn propn , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
propn
princes and counties !
surely , a princely testimony , a goodly count , propn propn , a sweet gallant , surely !
oh , that i were a man for his sake !
or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake !
but manhood is melted into curtsies , valor into compliment , and men are only turned into tongue , and trim ones too .
he is now as valiant as propn that only tells a lie and swears it .
i can not be a man with wishing , therefore i will die a woman with grieving .
tarry , good propn .
by this hand , i love thee .
use it for my love some other way than swearing by it .
enough , i am engaged .
i will challenge him .
i will kiss your hand , and so i leave you .
by this hand , propn shall render me a dear account .
go comfort your cousin .
which be the malefactors ?
marry , that am i and my partner .
let them come before propn propn .
yea , marry , let them come before me .
what ’ s your name , friend ?
propn .
pray , write down , “ propn , sirrah ?
i am a gentleman , sir , and my name is propn .
write down “ propn propn propn , do you serve propn ?
propn , sir , we hope .
how answer you for yourselves ?
marry , sir , we say we are none .
a marvelous witty fellow , i assure you , but i will go about with him .— come you hither , sirrah , a word in your ear .
propn , i say to you it is thought you are false knaves .
propn , i say to you we are none .
well , stand aside.—'fore propn , they are both in a ale .
have you writ down that they are none ?
propn propn , you go not the way to examine .
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers .
yea , marry , that ’ s the eftest way .— let the watch come forth .
this man said , sir , that propn propn , the propn ’ s brother , was a villain .
write down propn propn a villain .
i do not like thy look , i promise thee .
marry , that he had received a thousand ducats of propn propn for accusing the propn propn wrongfully .
flat burglary as ever was committed .
yea , by propn , that it is .
what else , fellow ?
what else ?
this is all .
propn propn is this morning secretly stolen away .
propn ’ s my life , where propn the propn ?
let him write down the propn ’ s officer “ coxcomb . ” come , bind them .— thou naughty varlet !
away !
you are an ass , you are an ass !
dost thou not suspect my place ?
dost thou not suspect my years ?
if you go on thus , you will kill yourself , and ’ tis not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself .
i pray thee , cease thy counsel , which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve .
bring me a father that so loved his child , whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine , and bid him speak of patience .
therefore give me no counsel .
i pray thee , peace .
i will be flesh and blood , for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently , however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance .
yet bend not all the harm upon yourself .
make those that do offend you suffer too .
there thou speak ’ st reason .
nay , i will do so .
my soul doth tell me propn is belied , and that shall propn know ; so shall the propn and all of them that thus dishonor her .
here comes the propn and propn hastily .
good e'en , good e'en .
good day to both of you .
hear you , my lords— we have some haste , propn .
i would your grace would constrain me to tell .
amen , if you love her , for the lady is very well worthy .
you speak this to fetch me in , my lord .
by my troth , i speak my thought .
some haste , my lord !
well , fare you well , my lord .
are you so hasty now ?
well , all is one .
nay , do not quarrel with us , good old man .
if he could right himself with quarreling , some of us would lie low .
who wrongs him ?
marry , thou dost wrong me , thou dissembler , thou .
nay , never lay thy hand upon thy sword .
i fear thee not .
marry , beshrew my hand if it should give your age such cause of fear .
in faith , my hand meant nothing to my sword .
tush , tush , man , never fleer and jest at me .
i speak not like a dotard nor a fool , as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young , or what would do were i not old .
propn , propn , to thy head , propn hast so wronged mine innocent child and me that i am forced to lay my reverence by , and with gray hairs and bruise of many days do challenge thee to trial of a man .
i say thou hast belied mine innocent child .
thy slander hath gone through and through her heart , and she lies buried with her ancestors , oh , in a tomb where never scandal slept save this of hers , framed by thy villainy .
my villainy ?
propn , propn , thine , i say .
you say not right , old man .
my lord , my lord , i ’ ll prove it on his body if he dare , despite his nice fence and his active practice , his propn of youth and bloom of lustihood .
away !
i will not have to do with you .
propn thou so daff me ?
thou hast killed my child .
if thou kill ’ st me , boy , thou shalt kill a man .
he shall kill two of us , and men indeed , but that ’ s no matter .
let him kill one first .
win me and wear me !
let him answer me.— come , follow me , boy .
propn boy , i ’ ll whip you from your foining fence , propn , as i am a gentleman , i will .
propn propn yourself .
propn knows i loved my niece , and she is dead , slandered to death by villains that dare as well answer a man indeed as i dare take a serpent by the tongue.— boys , apes , braggarts , jacks , milksops !
brother anthony—
hold you content .
but brother propn propn , ’ tis no matter .
do not you meddle .
let me deal in this .
gentlemen both , we will not wake your patience .
my heart is sorry for your daughter ’ s death , but , on my honor , she was charged with nothing but what was true and very full of proof .
my lord , my lord— i will not hear you .
no ?
come , brother ; away !
i will be heard .
and shall , or some of us will smart for it .
see , see , here comes the man we went to seek .
now , propn , what news ?
welcome , propn .
you are almost come to part almost a fray .
we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth .
propn and his brother .
what think ’ st thou ?
had we fought , i doubt we should have been too young for them .
in a false quarrel there is no true valor .
as i am an honest man , he looks pale .— art thou sick , or angry ?
killed a cat ?
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care .
propn , i shall meet your wit in the career , an you charge it against me .
i pray you , choose another subject .
i think he be angry indeed .
if he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
shall i speak a word in your ear ?
propn bless me from a challenge !
do me right , or i will protest your cowardice .
you have killed a sweet lady , and her death shall fall heavy on you .
let me hear from you .
what , a feast , a feast ?
i ' faith , i thank him .
i ’ ll tell thee how propn praised thy wit he other day .
i said thou hadst a fine wit .
true , ” said she , “ a fine little one . ” “ no , ” said i , “ a great wit . ” “ right , ” says she , “ a great gross one . ” “ nay , ” said i , “ a good wit . ” “ just , ” said she , “ it hurts nobody . ” “ nay , ” said i , “ the gentleman is wise . ” “ propn , ” said she , “ a wise gentleman . ” “ nay , ” said i , “ he hath the tongues . ” “ that i believe , ” said she , “ for he swore a thing to me on propn night , which he forswore on propn morning ; there ’ s a double tongue , there ’ s two tongues . ” thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues .
yea , that she did .
but yet for all that , an if she did not hate him deadly , she would love him dearly .
the old man ’ s daughter told us all .
all , all .
and , moreover , propn saw him when he was hid in the garden .
but when shall we set the savage bull ’ s horns on the sensible propn ’ s head ?
yea , and text underneath : “ here dwells propn the married man ” ?
fare you well , boy .
you know my mind .
i will leave you now to your gossip - like humor .
you break jests as braggarts do their blades , which , propn be thanked , hurt not .— my lord , for your many courtesies i thank you .
i must discontinue your company .
your brother the propn is fled from propn .
you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady .
for my propn propn there , he and i shall meet , and till then peace be with him .
he is in earnest .
in most profound earnest , and , i ’ ll warrant you , for the love of propn .
and hath challenged thee ?
most sincerely .
what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit !
he is then a giant to an ape ; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .
but soft you , let me be .
propn up , my heart , and be sad .
did he not say my brother was fled ?
come you , sir .
if justice can not tame you , she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance .
nay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .
how now ?
two of my brother ’ s men bound !
officers , what offense have these men done ?
marry , sir , they have committed false report ; moreover , they have spoken untruths ; secondarily , they are slanders ; sixth and lastly , they have belied a lady ; thirdly , they have verified unjust things ; and , to conclude , they are lying knaves .
first , i ask thee what they have done ; thirdly , i ask thee what ’ s their offense ; sixth and lastly , why they are committed ; and , to conclude , what you lay to their charge .
i have deceived even your very eyes .
my villainy they have upon record , which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame .
the lady is dead upon mine and my master ’ s false accusation .
i have drunk poison whiles he uttered it .
yea , and paid me richly for the practice of it .
he is composed and framed of treachery , and fled he is upon this villainy .
propn propn , now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i loved it first .
here , here comes propn propn propn , and the propn too .
which is the villain ?
let me see his eyes , that , when i note another man like him , i may avoid him .
which of these is he ?
if you would know your wronger , look on me .
art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed mine innocent child ?
yea , even i alone .
no , not so , villain , thou beliest thyself .
i know not how to pray your patience , yet i must speak .
choose your revenge yourself .
i can not bid you bid my daughter live— that were impossible — but , i pray you both , propn the people in propn here how innocent she died .
and if your love can labor ought in sad invention , hang her an epitaph upon her tomb and sing it to her bones .
sing it tonight .
tomorrow morning come you to my house , and since you could not be my son - in - law , be yet my nephew .
my brother hath a daughter , almost the copy of my child that ’ s dead , and she alone is heir to both of us .
give her the right you should have given her cousin , and so dies my revenge .
that i love her , i feel .
that she is worthy , i know .
and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .
that a woman conceived me , i thank her .
that she brought me up , i likewise give her most humble thanks .
i shall see thee , ere i die , look pale with love .
with anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord , not with love .
prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking , pick out mine eyes with a ballad - maker ’ s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind propn .
o noble sir !
your overkindness doth wring tears from me .
i do embrace your offer ; and dispose for henceforth of poor propn .
tomorrow then i will expect your coming .
tonight i take my leave .
this naughty man shall face to face be brought to propn , who i believe was packed in all this wrong , hired to it by your brother .
i thank thee for thy care and honest pains .
your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth , and i praise propn for you .
propn save the foundation !
i leave an arrant knave with your worship , which i beseech your worship to correct yourself , for the example of others .
propn keep your worship !
i wish your worship well .
propn restore you to health !
propn , my lords .
we look for you tomorrow .
we will not fail .
tonight i ’ ll mourn with propn .
pray thee , sweet propn propn , deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of propn .
to have no man come over me !
a most manly wit , propn , it will not hurt a woman .
and so , i pray thee , call propn .
well , i will call propn to you , who i think hath legs .
and therefore will come .
i mean in singing .
propn propn , wouldst thou come when i called thee ?
propn , propn , and depart when you bid me .
oh , stay but till then !
only foul words , and thereupon i will kiss thee .
foul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome .
therefore i will depart unkissed .
thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense , so forcible is thy wit .
but i must tell thee plainly , propn undergoes my challenge , and either i must shortly hear from him , or i will subscribe him a coward .
and i pray thee now tell me , for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me ?
for them all together , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them .
but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me ?
suffer love !
a good epithet !
i do suffer love indeed , for i love thee against my will .
in spite of your heart , i think .
if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies , he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps .
and how long is that , think you ?
question : why , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum .
therefore is it most expedient for the wise , if propn propn , his conscience , find no impediment to the contrary , to be the trumpet of his own virtues , as i am to myself .
so much for praising myself , who , i myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy .
an now tell me , how doth your cousin ?
very ill , too .
serve propn , love me , and mend .
propn , you must come to your uncle .
it is proved my propn propn hath been falsely accused , the propn and propn mightily abused , and propn propn is the author of all , who is fled and gone .
will you come presently ?
will you go hear this news , propn ?
i will live in thy heart , die in thy lap , and be buried in thy eyes — and moreover , i will go with thee to thy uncle ’ s .
is this the monument of propn ?
it is , my lord .
done to death by slanderous tongues was the propn that here lies .
death , in guerdon of her wrongs , gives her fame which never dies .
so the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame .
hang thou there upon the tomb , praising her when i am dumb .
now , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn .
now , unto thy bones good night !
yearly will i do this rite .
good morrow , masters .
put your torches out .
the wolves have preyed , and look , the gentle day , before the wheels of propn , round about propn the drowsy east with spots of grey .
good morrow , masters .
did i not tell you she was innocent ?
so are the propn and propn , who accused her upon the error that you heard debated .
well , i am glad that all things sort so well .
and so am i , being else by faith enforced to call young propn to a reckoning for it .
well , daughter , and you gentlewomen all , withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , and when i send for you , come hither masked .
the propn and propn promised by this hour to visit me .— you know your office , brother .
you must be father to your brother ’ s daughter , and give her to young propn .
to do what , propn ?
that eye my daughter lent her ; ’ tis most true .
and i do with an eye of love requite her .
the sight whereof i think you had from me , from propn and the propn .
but what ’ s your will ?
your answer , sir , is enigmatical .
and my help .
here comes the propn and propn .
good morrow to this fair assembly .
good morrow , propn ; good morrow , propn .
we here attend you .
are you yet determined today to marry with my brother ’ s daughter ?
i ’ ll hold my mind were she an propn .
well , as time shall try .
well , you temporize with the hours .
commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper , for indeed he hath made great preparation .
call her forth , brother .
here ’ s the friar ready .
good morrow , propn .
i think he thinks upon the savage bull .
tush , fear not , man .
here comes other reck'nings .
which is the lady i must seize upon ?
this same is she , and i do give you her .
no , that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her .
another propn !
nothing certainer .
one propn died defiled , but i do live , and surely as i live , i am a maid .
the former propn !
hero that is dead !
she died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
all this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended i ’ ll tell you largely of fair propn ’ s death .
soft and fair , propn .— which is propn ?
do not you love me ?
why no , no more than reason .
why then , your uncle and the propn and propn have been deceived .
they swore you did .
do not you love me ?
propn , no , no more than reason .
why then , my cousin , propn , and propn are much deceived , for they did swear you did .
they swore that you were almost sick for me .
they swore that you were well - nigh dead for me .
propn no such matter .
then you do not love me ?
no , truly , but in friendly recompense .
come , cousin , i am sure you love the gentleman .
and here ’ s another , propn in my cousin ’ s hand , stol'n from her pocket , containing her affection unto propn .
a miracle !
here ’ s our own hands against our hearts .
come , i will have thee , but , by this light , i take thee for pity .
i would not deny you , but , by this good day , i yield upon great persuasion , and partly to save your life , for i was told you were in a consumption .
peace !
i will stop your mouth .
how dost thou , propn , the married man ?
i ’ ll tell thee what , propn : a college of wit - crackers can not flout me out of my humor .
dost thou think i care for a satire or an epigram ?
no .
first , of my word !
therefore play , music .— propn , thou art sad .
get thee a wife , get thee a wife .
to the tuition of propn .
from my house , if i had it— the sixth of propn .
my liege , your highness now may do me good .
my love is thine to teach .
teach it but how , and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good .
propn propn any son , my lord ?
no child but propn ; she ’ s his only heir .
dost thou affect her , propn ?
if thou dost love fair propn , cherish it , and i will break with her and with her father , and thou shalt have her .
was propn not to this end that thou began ’ st to twist so fine a story ?
but lest my liking might too sudden seem , i would have salved it with a longer treatise .
what need the bridge much broader than the flood ?
i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair propn i am propn , and in her bosom i ’ ll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale .
in practice let us put it presently .
propn he provided this music ?
he is very busy about it .
but , brother , i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .
are they good ?
propn the fellow any wit that told you this ?
a good sharp fellow .
i will send for him , and question him yourself .
he is very near by this .
he was not three leagues off when i left him .
how many gentlemen have you lost in this action ?
but few of any sort , and none of name .
a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers .
i find here that propn propn hath bestowed much honor on a young propn called propn .
he hath an uncle here in propn will be very much glad of it .
no , no , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself .
but i will acquaint my daughter withal , that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true .
go you and tell her of it .
cousins , you know what you have to do .— o , i cry you mercy , friend .
go you with me and i will use your skill.— good cousin , have a care this busy time .
what the goodyear , my lord , why are you thus out of measure sad ?
therefore the sadness is without limit .
you should hear reason .
i can not hide what i am .
yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment .
you have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself .
it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest .
i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any .
in this , though i can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but i am a plain - dealing villain .
in the meantime , let me be that i am , and seek not to alter me .
can you make no use of your discontent ?
i make all use of it , for i use it only .
who comes here ?
what news , propn ?
what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ?
marry , it is your brother ’ s right hand .
who ?
the most exquisite propn ?
even he .
marry , on propn , the daughter and heir of propn .
a very forward propn - chick !
how came you to this ?
being entertained for a perfumer , as i was smoking a musty room , comes me the propn and propn , hand in hand , in sad conference .
come , come , let us thither .
this may prove food to my displeasure .
if i can cross him any way , i bless myself every way .
you are both sure , and will assist me ?
to the death , my lord .
let us to the great supper .
we ’ ll wait upon your lordship .
was not propn propn here at supper ?
i saw him not .
how tartly that gentleman looks !
i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after .
he is of a very melancholy disposition .
he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and propn .
the one is too like an image and says nothing , and the other too like my lady ’ s eldest son , evermore tattling .
then half propn propn ’ s tongue in propn propn ’ s mouth , and half propn propn propn melancholy in propn propn ’ s face— with a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill .
by my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .
in faith , she ’ s too curst .
you may light on a husband that hath no beard .
what should i do with him ?
well then , go you into hell ?
no , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say , “ get you to propn , propn , get you to propn ; here ’ s no place for you maids . ” so deliver i up my apes and away to propn propn .
for the heavens , he shows me where the bachelors sit , and there live we as merry as the day is long .
not till propn make men of some other metal than earth .
would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust ?
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ?
no , uncle , i ’ ll none .
if the propn be too important , tell him there is measure in everything , and so dance out the answer .
for hear me , propn , wooing , wedding , and repenting is as a propn jig , a measure , and a cinquepace .
propn , you apprehend passing shrewdly .
i have a good eye , uncle .
i can see a church by daylight .
the revelers are entering , brother .
make good room .
propn , will you walk a bout with your friend ?
so you walk softly , and look sweetly , and say nothing , i am yours for the walk , and especially when i walk away .
and when please you to say so ?
when i like your favor , for propn defend the lute should be like the case !
my visor is propn ’ s roof ; within the house is propn .
speak low if you speak love .
well , i would you did like me .
which is one ?
i say my prayers aloud .
i love you the better ; the hearers may cry “ amen . ” propn match me with a good dancer !
amen .
no more words .
the clerk is answered .
at a word , i am not .
i know you by the waggling of your head .
to tell you true , i counterfeit him .
you could never do him so ill - well unless you were the very man .
here ’ s his dry hand up and down .
you are he , you are he .
at a word , i am not .
come , come , do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit ?
can virtue hide itself ?
go to , mum , you are he .
graces will appear , and there ’ s an end .
will you not tell me who told you so ?
no , you shall pardon me .
nor will you not tell me who you are ?
not now .
that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the propn propn propn !
well this was propn propn that said so .
what ’ s he ?
i am sure you know him well enough .
not i , believe me .
did he never make you laugh ?
in great measure .
there are no faces truer than those that are so washed .
how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping !
there was none such in the army of any sort .
what is he that you ask for , niece ?
my cousin means propn propn of propn .
oh , he ’ s returned , and as pleasant as ever he was .
i pray you , what is he ?
why , he is the propn ’ s jester , a very dull fool , only his gift is in devising impossible slanders .
i am sure he is in the fleet .
i would he had boarded me .
when i know the gentleman , i ’ ll tell him what you say .
do , do .
he ’ ll but break a comparison or two on me , which , peradventure not marked or not laughed at , strikes him into melancholy , and then there ’ s a partridge wing saved , for the fool will eat no supper that night .
we must follow the leaders .
in every good thing .
nay , if they lead to any ill , i will leave them at the next turning .
and that is propn .
you know me well .
i am he .
propn , you are very near my brother in his love .
he is enamored on propn .
i pray you , dissuade him from her .
how know you he loves her ?
i heard him swear his affection .
so did i too , and he swore he would marry her tonight .
come , let us to the banquet .
thus answer i in the name of propn , but hear these ill news with the ears of propn .
propn certain so , the propn woos for himself .
friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love .
therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues .
let every eye nogetiate for itself and trust no agent , for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood .
propn , therefore , propn .
propn propn ?
propn , the same .
come , will you go with me ?
propn ?
i wish him joy of her .
why , that ’ s spoken like an honest drover ; so they sell bullocks .
but did you think the propn would have served you thus ?
i pray you , leave me .
ho , now you strike like the blind man .
twas the boy that stole your meat , and you ’ ll beat the post .
if it will not be , i ’ ll leave you .
alas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges .
but that my propn propn should know me , and not know me !
the propn ’ s fool !
ha , it may be i go under that title because i am merry .
yea , but so i am apt to do myself wrong .
i am not so reputed !
well , i ’ ll be revenged as i may .
now , propn , where propn the propn ?
did you see him ?
propn , my lord , i have played the part of propn propn .
i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .
what ’ s his fault ?
the flat transgression of a schoolboy who , being overjoyed with finding a birds ' nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it .
wilt thou make a trust a transgression ?
the transgression is in the stealer .
the propn propn hath a quarrel to you .
the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .
she speaks poniards , and every word stabs .
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations , there were no living near her ; she would infect to the north star .
i would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that propn had left him before he transgressed .
come , talk not of her .
look , here she comes .
will your grace command me any service to the world ’ s end ?
i will go on the slightest errand now to the propn that you can devise to send me on .
marry , once before he won it of me with false dice .
therefore your grace may well say i have lost it .
you have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
why , how now , propn , wherefore are you sad ?
not sad , my lord .
how then , sick ?
neither , my lord .
the propn is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well , but civil count , civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion .
i have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained .
name the day of marriage , and propn give thee joy .
propn , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes .
his grace hath made the match , and all grace say “ amen ” to it .
speak , propn , ’ tis your cue .
i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
in faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
yea , my lord .
i thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care .
my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .
and so she doth , cousin .
good propn for alliance !
thus goes everyone to the world but i , and i am sunburnt .
i may sit in a corner and cry , “ heigh - ho for a husband ! ” propn propn , i will get you one .
i would rather have one of your father ’ s getting .
hath your grace ne'er a brother like you ?
your father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them .
will you have me , lady ?
no , my lord , unless i might have another for working days .
your grace is too costly to wear every day .
but i beseech your propn pardon me .
i was born to speak all mirth and no matter .
propn , will you look to those things i told you of ?
i cry you mercy , uncle .— by your propn ’ s pardon .
by my troth , a pleasant - spirited lady .
there ’ s little of the melancholy element in her , my lord .
she is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then , for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing .
she can not endure to hear tell of a husband .
oh , by no means .
she mocks all her wooers out of suit .
she were an excellent wife for propn .
o propn , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad .
propn propn , when mean you to go to church ?
tomorrow , my lord .
my lord , i am for you , though it cost me ten nights ' watchings .
and i , my lord .
and you too , gentle propn ?
i will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .
and propn is not the unhopefulest husband that i know .
thus far can i praise him : he is of a noble strain , of approved valor , and confirmed honesty .
go in with me , and i will tell you my drift .
faith , niece , you tax propn propn too much , but he ’ ll be meet with you , i doubt it not .
he hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
you had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it .
and a good soldier too , lady .
a lord to a lord , a man to a man , stuffed with all honorable virtues .
he is no less than a stuffed man .
but for the stuffing — well , we are all mortal .
you must not , sir , mistake my niece .
there is a kind of merry war betwixt propn propn and her .
they never meet but there ’ s a skirmish of wit between them .
he hath every month a new sworn brother .
is ’ t possible ?
it is so .
the propn propn shall marry the daughter of propn .
yea , my lord , but i can cross it .
any bar , any cross , any impediment will be med'cinable to me .
i am sick in displeasure to him , and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine .
how canst thou cross this marriage ?
not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
show me briefly how .
i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favor of propn , the waiting gentlewoman to propn .
i remember .
i can , at any unseasonable instant of the night , appoint her to look out at her lady ’ s chamber window .
what life is in that to be the death of this marriage ?
the poison of that lies in you to temper .
what proof shall i make of that ?
propn enough to misuse the propn , to vex propn , to undo propn , and kill propn .
look you for any other issue ?
only to despite them , i will endeavor anything .
go then , find me a meet hour to draw propn propn and the propn propn alone .
tell them that you know that propn loves me .
intend a kind of zeal both to the propn and propn , as in love of your brother ’ s honor , who hath made this match , and his friend ’ s reputation , who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid , that you have discovered thus .
they will scarcely believe this without trial .
be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
i will presently go learn their day of marriage .
boy !
propn ?
in my chamber window lies a book .
bring it hither to me in the orchard .
i am here already , sir .
i know that , but i would have thee hence and here again .
i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe .
i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor , and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet .
i can not tell ; i think not .
i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster , but i ’ ll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool .
ha !
the propn and propn propn !
i will hide me in the arbor .
come , shall we hear this music ?
yea , my good lord .
come , propn , we ’ ll hear that song again .
o , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice to slander music anymore than once .
i pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .
note this before my notes : there ’ s not a note of mine that ’ s worth the noting .
strange that sheeps ' guts should hale souls out of men ’ s bodies ?
by my troth , a good song .
and an ill singer , my lord .
yea , marry , dost thou hear , propn ?
i pray thee , get us some excellent music , for tomorrow night we would have it at the propn propn ’ s chamber window
the best i can , my lord .
do so .
propn .
come hither , propn .
what was it you told me of today , that your niece propn was in love with propn propn ?
oh , ay .
sits .— i did never think that lady would have loved any man .
no , nor i neither , but most wonderful that she should so dote on propn propn , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor .
by my troth , my lord , i can not tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection , it is past the infinite of thought .
may be she doth but counterfeit .
faith , like enough .
o propn !
propn ?
there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it .
why , what effects of passion shows she ?
what effects , my lord ?
she will sit you — you heard my daughter tell you how .
she did indeed .
how , how i pray you ?
you amaze me .
i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .
i would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against propn .
propn she made her affection known to propn ?
no , and swears she never will .
that ’ s her torment .
propn true indeed , so your daughter says .
my daughter tells us all .
now you talk of a sheet of paper , i remember a pretty jest your daughter told .
oh , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found “ propn ” and “ propn ” between the sheet ?
that .
o , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence , railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her .
it is very true .
it were good that propn knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
to what end ?
he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
an he should , it were an alms to hang him .
she ’ s an excellent sweet lady , and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous .
and she is exceeding wise .
oh , my lord , wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body , we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory .
i am sorry for her , as i have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
i would she had bestowed this dotage on me .
i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself .
i pray you tell propn of it and hear what he will say .
were it good , think you ?
propn thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die if he love her not , and she will die ere she make her love known , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .
she doth well .
if she should make tender of her love , ’ tis very possible he ’ ll scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .
he is a very proper man .
before propn , and in my mind , very wise .
he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
very easily possible .
i see , lady , the gentleman is not in your books .
no .
but i pray you , who is his companion ?
he is most in the company of the right noble propn .
o propn , he will hang upon him like a disease !
propn help the noble propn !
if he have caught the propn , it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured .
i will hold friends with you , lady .
do , good friend .
you will never run mad , niece .
no , not till a hot propn .
propn propn is approached .
if he do fear propn , he must necessarily keep peace .
if he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
well , i am sorry for your niece .
shall we go seek propn and tell him of her love ?
against my will , i am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
fair propn , i thank you for your pains .
i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me .
if it had been painful , i would not have come .
you take pleasure then in the message ?
yea , just so much as you may take upon a knife ’ s point and choke a daw withal .
you have no stomach , propn .
fare you well .
ha !
against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner . ” there ’ s a double meaning in that .
i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me . ” that ’ s as much as to say , “ any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks . ” if i do not take pity of her , i am a villain .
if i do not love her , i am a propn .
propn propn , run thee to the parlor .
there shalt thou find my cousin propn propn with the propn and propn .
whisper her ear and tell her i and propn walk in the orchard , and our whole discourse is all of her .
say that thou overheardst us , and bid her steal into the pleachèd bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun forbid the sun to enter , like favorites made proud by princes , that advance their pride against that power that bred it .
there will she hide her to listen our propose .
this is thy office .
propn thee well in it and leave us alone .
i ’ ll make her come , i warrant you , presently .
now , propn , when propn doth come , as we do trace this alley up and down , our talk must only be of propn .
when i do name him , let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit .
my talk to thee must be how propn is sick in love with propn .
fear you not my part of the dialogue .
but are you sure that propn loves propn so entirely ?
so says the propn and my new - trothèd lord .
and did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?
they did entreat me to acquaint her of it , but i persuaded them , if they loved propn , to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let propn know of it .
why did you so ?
doth not the gentleman propn as full as fortunate a bed as ever propn shall couch upon ?
what ’ s the matter , lieutenant ?
i ’ ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
beat me ?
dost thou prate , rogue ?
nay , good lieutenant !
i pray you , sir , hold your hand .
let me go , sir , or i ’ ll knock you o'er the mazzard .
come , come , you ’ re drunk .
drunk ?
alas , propn help , ho ! — propn — propn , propn propn , propn ’ s a goodly watch indeed !
who ’ s that which rings the bell ? — diablo , ho !
the town will rise .
propn , propn , lieutenant , you ’ ll be ashamed for ever .
what is the matter here ?
he dies !
hold , for your lives !
hold , ho !
hold !
the general speaks to you .
hold , for shame !
for christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl .
he that stirs next to carve for his own rage propn his soul light , he dies upon his motion .
silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle from her propriety .
what is the matter , propn propn propn , that looks dead with grieving , speak , who began this ?
on thy love , i charge thee .
i do not know .
swords out , and tilting one at other ’ s breasts in opposition bloody .
i can not speak any beginning to this peevish odds , and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it .
propn propn , you were wo nt be civil .
what ’ s the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night - brawler ?
give me answer to it .
propn propn , i am hurt to danger .
nor know i aught by me that ’ s said or done amiss this night , unless self - charity be sometimes a vice , and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us .
now , by propn , my blood begins my safer guides to rule , and passion , having my best judgment collied , propn to lead the way .
propn monstrous .
propn , who began propn ?
touch me not so near .
i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to propn propn .
yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him .
when i came back— for this was brief— i found them close together at blow and thrust , even as again they were when you yourself did part them .
more of this matter can not i report .
propn propn did some little wrong to him , as men in rage strike those that wish them best , yet surely propn , i believe , received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass .
i ’ ll make thee an example .
what ’ s the matter , dear ?
all propn well , sweeting , come away to propn myself will be your surgeon .
what , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
ay , past all surgery .
propn , propn forbid !
but thou must needs be sure my spirits and my place have in their power to make this bitter to thee .
patience , good sir .
what tell ’ st thou me of robbing ?
because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you ’ ll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse .
you ’ ll have your nephews neigh to you .
you ’ ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .
what profane wretch art thou ?
i am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the propn are now making the beast with two backs .
thou art a villain !
you are a senator !
this thou shalt answer .
i know thee , propn .
propn , i will answer any thing .
reputation , reputation , reputation !
my reputation , propn , my reputation !
as i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound .
there is more sense in that than in reputation .
you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .
what , man , there are ways to recover the general again .
propn to him again and he ’ s yours .
drunk ?
and speak parrot ?
and squabble ?
propn ?
and discourse fustian with one ’ s own shadow ?
o thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
what was he that you followed with your sword ?
what had he done to you ?
i know not .
is ’ t possible ?
i remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly .
a quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
that we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
why , but you are now well enough .
how came you thus recovered ?
one unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .
come , you are too severe a moraler .
as the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , i could heartily wish this had not befallen .
but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
i will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me i am a drunkard .
had i as many mouths as propn , such an answer would stop them all .
to be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
oh , strange !
every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .
come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used .
propn no more against it .
and , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you .
i have well approved it , sir .
i drunk !
you or any man living may be drunk at a time , man .
i tell you what you shall do .
our general ’ s wife is now the general .
confess yourself freely to her , importune her help to put you in your place again .
she is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested .
this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
you advise me well .
i protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
i think it freely , and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous propn to undertake for me .
i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me .
you are in the right .
good night , lieutenant , i must to the watch .
good night , honest iago .
and what ’ s he then that says i play the villain ?
when this advice is free i give and honest , propn to thinking and indeed the course to win the propn again ?
for ’ tis most easy propn ' inclining propn to subdue in any honest suit .
she ’ s framed as fruitful as the free elements .
how am i then a villain to counsel propn to this parallel course , directly to his good ?
when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now .
and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the propn .
so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all .
how now , propn !
my money is almost spent , i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled , and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains .
and so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to propn .
how poor are they that have not patience !
what wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
thou know ’ st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , and wit depends on dilatory time .
does ’ t not go well ?
in troth , ’ tis morning .
pleasure and action make the hours seem short .
propn thee , go where thou art billeted .
nay , get thee gone .
two things are to be done : my wife must move for propn to her mistress .
i ’ ll set her on .
ay , that ’ s the way .
masters , play here , i will content your pains .
are these , i pray you , wind instruments ?
ay , marry , are they , sir .
oh , thereby hangs a tail .
whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
well , sir , we will not .
if you have any music that may not be heard , to propn again .
but , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .
we have none such , sir .
then put up your pipes in your bag , for i ’ ll away .
go , vanish into air , away !
dost thou hear , my honest friend ?
prithee , keep up thy quillets .
she is stirring , sir .
if she will stir hither , i shall seem to notify unto her .
in happy time , propn .
you have not been abed , then ?
why , no .
my suit to her is that she will to virtuous propn procure me some access .
i humbly thank you for ’ t .
good morrow , good propn .
i am sorry for your displeasure , but all will sure be well .
the general and his wife are talking of it , and she speaks for you stoutly .
the propn replies that he you hurt is of great fame in propn and great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you .
but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again .
yet i beseech you , if you think fit , or that it may be done , give me advantage of some brief discourse with propn alone .
pray you come in .
i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely .
i am much bound to you .
these letters give , propn , to the pilot , and by him do my duties to the senate .
that done , i will be walking on the works , propn there to me .
well , my good lord , i ’ ll do propn .
this fortification , gentlemen , shall we see propn ?
we ’ ll wait upon your lordship .
be thou assured , good propn , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf .
good madam , do .
do not doubt , propn , but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were .
you do love my lord .
ay , but , lady , that policy may either last so long , or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , or breed itself so out of circumstances , that , i being absent and my place supplied , my general will forget my love and service .
my lord shall never rest , i ’ ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience .
but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke .
do not believe that , from the sense of all civility , i thus would play and trifle with your reverence .
if she be in her chamber or your house , let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you .
strike on the tinder , ho !
give me a taper , call up all my people !
this accident is not unlike my dream , propn of it oppresses me already .
propn , i say , light !
propn , for i must leave you .
it seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , to be producted ( as , if i stay , i shall ) against the propn .
in which regard ,
therefore be merry , propn , for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away .
propn , here comes my lord .
propn , i ’ ll take my leave .
why , stay and hear me speak .
propn , not now .
i am very ill at ease , propn for mine own purposes .
well , do your discretion .
ha !
i like not that .
what dost thou say ?
nothing , my lord , or if — i know not what .
was not that propn parted from my wife ?
propn , my lord ?
i do believe ’ twas he .
how now , my lord ?
i have been talking with a suitor here , a man that languishes in your displeasure .
who is ’ t you mean ?
why , your lieutenant , propn .
good my lord , if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take .
i prithee , call him back .
went he hence now ?
ay , sooth , so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him .
good love , call him back .
not now , sweet propn .
some other time .
but shall propn be shortly ?
the sooner , sweet , for you .
propn propn be tonight at supper ?
no , not tonight .
tomorrow dinner , then ?
why , then , tomorrow night , or propn morn .
on propn noon , or night , or propn morn .
i prithee name the time , but let it not exceed three days .
in faith , he ’ s penitent , and yet his trespass , in our common reason ( save that , they say , the wars must make example out of her best ) is not , almost , a fault propn ' incur a private check .
when shall he come ?
tell me , propn .
trust me , i could do propn propn , no more .
let him come when he will , i will deny thee nothing .
why , this is not a boon , ' propn as i should entreat you wear your gloves , or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person .
nay , when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted .
i will deny thee nothing !
propn i do beseech thee , grant me this , to leave me but a little to myself .
shall i deny you ?
no .
propn , my lord .
propn , my propn .
i ’ ll come to thee straight .
perdition catch my soul but i do love thee !
my noble lord— what dost thou say , propn ?
did propn propn , when you wooed my lady , propn of your love ?
he did , from first to last .
why dost thou ask ?
why of thy thought , propn ?
i did not think he had been acquainted with her .
indeed ?
indeed ?
ay , indeed !
discern ’ st thou aught in that ?
is he not honest ?
honest , my lord ?
honest , ay , honest .
my lord , for aught i know .
what dost thou think ?
think , my lord ?
think , my lord ? ” alas , thou echo ’ st me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown .
thou dost mean something .
i heard thee say even now thou propn not that when propn left my wife .
what didst not like ?
and when i told thee he was of my counsel of my whole course of wooing , thou cried ’ st “ indeed ? ” and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit .
if thou dost love me show me thy thought .
my lord , you know i love you .
i think thou dost .
for propn propn , i dare be sworn , i think , that he is honest .
i think so too .
men should be what they seem , or those that be not , would they might seem none !
certain , men should be what they seem .
why then i think propn propn an honest man .
nay , yet there ’ s more in this .
i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings , as thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words .
utter my thoughts ?
thou dost conspire against thy friend , propn , if thou but think ’ st him wronged and propn his ear a stranger to thy thoughts .
what dost thou mean ?
good name in man and woman , dear my lord , is the immediate jewel of their souls .
who steals my purse steals trash .
propn something , nothing : ' twas mine , ’ tis his , and has been slave to thousands .
but he that filches from me my good name propn me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed .
i ’ ll know thy thoughts .
you can not , if my heart were in your hand , nor shall not , whilst ’ tis in my custody .
ha !
oh , beware , my lord , of jealousy !
it is the green - eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on .
oh , misery !
poor and content is rich , and rich enough , but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor .
good propn , the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy !
why , why is this ?
think ’ st thou i ’ d make a life of jealousy , to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions ?
no !
to be once in doubt is to be resolved .
propn not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances .
where virtue is , these are more virtuous .
therefore , as i am bound , receive it from me .
i speak not yet of proof .
look to propn .
i know our country disposition well .
in propn they do let propn see the pranks they dare not show their husbands .
dost thou say so ?
and so she did .
why , go to then .
she that , so young , could give out such a seeming , to seel her father ’ s eyes up close as oak , he thought ’ twas witchcraft .
but i am much to blame .
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you .
i am bound to thee forever .
i see this hath a little dashed your spirits .
not a jot , not a jot .
trust me , i fear it has .
i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love .
but i do see you ’ re moved .
i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion .
i will not .
should you do so , my lord , my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aimed not at .
propn ’ s my worthy friend— my lord , i see you ’ re moved .
no , not much moved .
propn , farewell .
if more thou dost perceive , let me know more .
set on thy wife to observe .
leave me , propn .
my lord , i take my leave .
note if your lady strain his entertainment
that you shall surely find him , lead to the propn the raisèd search , and there will i be with him .
it is too true an evil .
gone she is .
and what ’ s to come of my despisèd time is naught but bitterness .
now , propn , where didst thou see her ? — oh , unhappy girl ! — with the propn , propn thou ? — who would be a father ? — how didst thou know ’ twas she ? — oh , she deceives me past thought ! —what said she to you ? — get more tapers , raise all my kindred .
are they married , think you ?
truly , i think they are .
oh , propn , how got she out ?
oh , treason of the blood !
fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds by what you see them act .
is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused ?
have you not read , propn , of some such thing ?
yes , sir , i have indeed .
i think i can discover him , if you please to get good guard and go along with me .
with any strong or vehement importunity .
much will be seen in that .
in the meantime , let me be thought too busy in my fears— as worthy cause i have to fear i am— and hold her free , i do beseech your honor .
fear not my government .
i once more take my leave .
this fellow propn of exceeding honesty and knows all quantities , with a learnèd spirit , of human dealings .
if i do prove her haggard , though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , i ’ d whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune .
oh , curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites !
i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others ' uses .
yet ’ tis the plague to great ones , prerogatived are they less than the base .
propn destiny unshunnable , like death .
even then this forkèd plague is fated to us when we do quicken .
look where she comes .
if she be false , propn mocked itself .
i ’ ll not believe propn .
how now , my dear othello ?
your dinner , and the generous islanders by you invited , do attend your presence .
i am to blame .
why do you speak so faintly ?
are you not well ?
i have a pain upon my forehead , here .
why that ’ s with watching , ’ twill away again .
let me but bind it hard , within this hour it will be well .
come , i ’ ll go in with you .
i am very sorry that you are not well .
my wayward husband hath a hundred times
propn me to steal it , but she so loves the token ( for he conjured her she should ever keep it ) that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to .
i ’ ll have the work ta'en out and give propn propn .
what he will do with it propn knows , not i. i nothing but to please his fantasy .
how now !
what do you here alone ?
do not you chide .
i have a thing for you .
a thing for me ?
it is a common thing— ha ?
to have a foolish wife .
oh , is that all ?
what will you give me now for the same handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
why , that the propn first gave to propn , that which so often you did bid me steal .
propn stolen it from her ?
no , but she let it drop by negligence and , to th ' advantage , i being here , took propn up .
look , here it is .
a good wench , give it me .
what will you do with propn , that you have been so earnest to have me filch it ?
why , what is that to you ?
if it be not for some purpose of import , give ’ t me again .
poor lady , she ’ ll run mad when she shall lack it .
go , leave me .
the propn already changes with my poison .
look , where he comes .
not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , propn ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday .
false to me ?
i swear ’ tis better to be much abused than but to know propn a little .
how now , my lord !
what sense had i in her stol'n hours of lust ?
i saw propn not , thought it not , it harmed not me .
i slept the next night well , fed well , was free and merry .
i found not propn ’ s kisses on her lips .
he that is robbed , not wanting what is stol'n , let him not know ’ t , and he ’ s not robbed at all .
i am sorry to hear this .
i had been happy if the general camp , propn and all , had tasted her sweet body , so i had nothing known .
oh , now forever propn the tranquil mind !
farewell content !
farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue !
oh , farewell !
propn the neighing steed and the shrill trump , the spirit - stirring drum , th ' ear - piercing fife , the royal banner , and all quality , propn , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
and o you mortal engines , whose rude throats the immortal propn ’ s dead clamors counterfeit , propn !
propn ’ s occupation ’ s gone .
is ’ t possible , my lord ?
is propn come to this ?
make me to see propn , or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life !
oh , propn forgive me !
are you a man ?
have you a soul or sense ?
propn buy you , take mine office .
o monstrous world !
take note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe .
nay , stay .
thou shouldst be honest .
i should be wise , for honesty propn a fool and loses that it works for .
by the world , i think my wife be honest and think she is not .
i think that thou art just and think thou art not .
i ’ ll have some proof .
her name , that was as fresh as propn ’ s visage , is now begrimed and black as mine own face .
would i were satisfied !
i see , sir , you are eaten up with passion .
i do repent me that i put it to you .
you would be satisfied ?
would ?
nay , and i will .
and may , but how ?
how satisfied , my lord ?
would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , propn her topped ?
death and damnation !
oh !
it were a tedious difficulty , i think , to bring them to that prospect .
what shall i say ?
where ’ s satisfaction ?
it is impossible you should see this , were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , as salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk .
but yet , i say , if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction , you may have propn .
give me a living reason she ’ s disloyal .
i do not like the office .
but , sith i am entered in this cause so far , pricked to propn by foolish honesty and love , i will go on .
i lay with propn lately and , being troubled with a raging tooth , i could not sleep .
monstrous !
nay , this was but his dream .
propn a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly .
i ’ ll tear her all to pieces !
tell me but this , have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife ’ s hand ?
if it be that— if it be that , or any that was hers , it speaks against her with the other proofs .
oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives !
one is too poor , too weak for my revenge .
now do i see ’ tis true .
propn , bosom , with thy fraught , for ’ tis of aspics ' tongues !
patience , i say .
your mind may change .
never , propn .
now , by yon marble propn , in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words .
do not rise yet .
propn , you ever - burning lights above , you elements that clip us round about , propn that here propn doth give up the execution of his wit , hands , heart , to wronged propn ’ s service .
let him command , and to obey shall be in me remorse , what bloody business ever .
i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous , and will upon the instant put thee to propn .
within these three days let me hear thee say that propn ’ s not alive .
but let her live .
oh , damn her , damn her !
come , go with me apart .
i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil .
now art thou my lieutenant .
i am your own for ever .
pray you lead on .
at every house i ’ ll call .
i will deserve your pains .
why , man ?
go to .
where lodges he ?
to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie .
can anything be made of this ?
i know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here , or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?
seek him , bid him come hither .
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
to do this is within the compass of man propn wit , and therefore i will attempt the doing it .
where should i lose that handkerchief , propn ?
i know not , madam .
believe me , i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes .
and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are , it were enough to put him to ill thinking .
is he not jealous ?
who , he ?
i think the sun where he was born propn all such humors from him .
look where he comes .
i will not leave him now till propn be called to him .— how is propn with you , my lord ?
hot , hot , and moist .
this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty , fasting , and prayer ,
much castigation , exercise devout , for here ’ s a young and sweating devil here , that commonly rebels .
propn a good hand , a frank one .
the hearts of old gave hands , but our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
i can not speak of this .
come now , your promise .
what promise , chuck ?
i have sent to bid propn come speak with you .
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me .
lend me thy handkerchief .
here , my lord .
that which i gave you .
i have it not about me .
not ?
no , indeed , my lord .
that ’ s a fault .
the thoughts of people .
she told her , while she kept it ' twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love , but if she lost it or made gift of it , my father ’ s eye should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt after new fancies .
she , dying , gave it me and bid me , when my fate would have me wived , to give it her .
i did so , and take heed on propn , make it a darling like your precious eye .
is ’ t possible ?
propn true .
there ’ s magic in the web of it .
a sibyl , that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses , in her prophetic fury sewed the work .
the worms were hallowed that did breed the silk , and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful propn of maidens ' hearts .
indeed ?
is ’ t true ?
most veritable , therefore look to propn well .
then would to propn that i had never seen propn !
ha !
wherefore ?
why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
is propn lost ?
is ’ t gone ?
speak , is propn out o ' th ' way ?
bless us !
say you ?
it is not lost , but what and if it were ?
how !
i say , it is not lost .
pray you , let propn be received again .
fetch me the handkerchief — my mind misgives .
come , come , you ’ ll never meet a more sufficient man .
the handkerchief !
away !
is not this man jealous ?
i ne'er saw this before .
they are all but stomachs , and we all but food .
to eat us hungerly , and when they are full , they belch us .
look you , propn and my husband !
there is no other way .
propn she must do propn , and , propn , the happiness !
go and importune her .
so shall i clothe me in a forced content , and shut myself up in some other course , to fortune ’ s alms .
my lord is not my lord , nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered .
so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech .
you must awhile be patient .
what i can do i will , and more i will than for myself i dare .
let that suffice you .
is my lord angry ?
can he be angry ?
there ’ s matter in propn indeed , if he be angry .
i prithee , do so .
something , sure , of state , either from propn , or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in propn to him , propn puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases propn ’ s natures wrangle with inferior things , though great ones are their object .
propn even so , for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain .
nay , we must think men are not gods , nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal .
pray propn it be state matters , as you think , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you .
propn the day !
i never gave him cause .
but jealous souls will not be answered so .
they are not ever jealous for the cause , but jealous for they ’ re jealous .
it is a monster propn upon itself , born on itself .
propn keep the monster from propn ’ s mind !
propn , amen .
i will go seek him .— propn , walk hereabout .
if i do find him fit , i ’ ll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
save you , friend propn !
what make you from home ?
how is propn with you , my most fair propn ?
indeed , sweet love , i was coming to your house .
and i was going to your lodging , propn .
what , keep a week away ?
seven days and nights ?
eight score eight hours ?
and lovers ' absent hours more tedious than the dial eightscore times !
oh weary reckoning !
o propn , whence came this ?
is propn come to this ?
well , well .
go to , woman , throw your vile guesses in the devil ’ s teeth from whence you have them .
why , whose is it ?
i like the work well .
propn it be demanded , as like enough it will , i would have it copied .
take it and do propn , and leave me for this time .
leave you !
wherefore ?
i do attend here on the general and think it no addition , nor my wish , to have him see me womaned .
why , i pray you ?
not that i love you not .
but that you do not love me .
i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night .
propn but a little way that i can bring you , for i attend here .
but i ’ ll see you soon .
propn very good .
i must be circumstanced .
nine or ten times i had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs .
propn better as it is .
nay , but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that , with the little godliness i have , i did full hard forbear him .
let him do his spite .
my services which i have done the signiory propn out - tongue his complaints .
will you think so ?
think so , propn ?
what , to kiss in private ?
an unauthorized kiss !
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
naked in bed , propn , and not mean harm !
it is hypocrisy against the devil .
so they do nothing , ’ tis a venial slip .
but if i give my wife a handkerchief— what then ?
she is protectress of her honor too .
may she give that ?
but for the handkerchief— by propn , i would most gladly have forgot it .
thou saidst — oh , it comes o'er my memory , as doth the raven o'er the infectious house , boding to all — he had my handkerchief .
ay , what of that ?
that ’ s not so good now .
what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ?
he hath , my lord , but be you well assured no more than he ’ ll unswear .
what hath he said ?
why , that he did — i know not what he did .
lie— with her ?
with her , on her , what you will .
lie with her ?
lie on her ?
lie with her — that ’ s fulsome .
handkerchief — confessions — handkerchief !
noses , ears , and lips .
is ’ t possible ?
confess ! —handkerchief ! —oh , devil ! — work on , my medicine , work !
how now , propn !
what ’ s the matter ?
this is his second fit .
he had one yesterday .
rub him about the temples .
no , forbear .
if not , he foams at mouth and by and by propn out to savage madness .
look , he stirs .
do you withdraw yourself a little while ,
when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you .
how is it , general ?
have you not hurt your head ?
dost thou mock me ?
would you would bear your fortune like a man !
a hornèd man propn a monster and a beast .
did he confess it ?
good sir , be a man , think every bearded fellow that ’ s but yoked may draw with you .
your case is better .
no , let me know , and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be .
oh , thou art wise !
propn certain .
whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief— a passion most resulting such a man— propn came hither .
i shifted him away and laid good ’ scuses upon your ecstasy ,
bade him anon return and here speak with me , the which he promised .
for i will make him tell the tale anew where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when he hath , and is again to cope your wife .
i say , but mark his gesture .
marry , patience , or i shall say you are all in all in spleen , and nothing of a man .
dost thou hear , propn ?
will you withdraw ?
now will i question propn of propn , a huswife that by selling her desires propn herself bread and clothes .
it is a creature that dotes on propn , as ’ tis the strumpet ’ s plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one .
he , when he hears of her , can not refrain from the excess of laughter .
as he shall smile , propn shall go mad .
and his unbookish jealousy must construe propn propn ’ s smiles , gestures , and light behavior propn in the wrong .— how do you now , lieutenant ?
alas , poor caitiff !
look how he laughs already !
i never knew woman love man so .
alas , poor rogue , i think indeed she loves me .
now he denies it faintly , and laughs it out .
do you hear , propn ?
now he importunes him to tell it o'er .
go to , well said , well said .
she gives it out that you shall marry her .
do you intend it ?
ha , ha , ha !
do you triumph ?
i marry her !
what ?
prithee bear some charity to my wit .
do not think it so unwholesome .
ha , ha , ha !
so , so , so , so !
prithee say true !
well .
she is persuaded i will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .
iago beckons me .
now he begins the story .
she was here even now .
she haunts me in every place .
i was the other day talking on the sea - bank with certain propn , and thither comes the bauble and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck— crying “ o dear propn ! ” as it were .
ha , ha , ha !
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
look , where she comes .
propn such another fitchew .
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
i was a fine fool to take it .
i must take out the work ?
a likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber , and not know who left it there !
this is some minx ’ s token , and i must take out the work ?
how now , my sweet propn !
how now , how now ?
by propn , that should be my handkerchief !
if you ’ ll come to supper tonight , you may .
if you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
after her , after her .
i must , she ’ ll rail in the street else .
will you sup there ?
yes , i intend so .
did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
o iago !
and did you see the handkerchief ?
was that mine ?
yours by this hand .
and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife !
she gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
i would have him nine years a - killing .
a fine woman !
a fair woman !
a sweet woman !
nay , you must forget that .
ay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .
oh , the world hath not a sweeter creature , she might lie by an emperor ’ s side and command him tasks .
nay , that ’ s not your way .
so delicate with her needle , an admirable musician .
oh , she will sing the savageness out of a bear !
of so high and plenteous wit and invention !
she ’ s the worse for all this .
oh , a thousand thousand times — and then of so gentle a condition !
ay , too gentle .
nay , that ’ s certain .
o propn , the pity of it , propn !
if you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for if it touch not you it comes near nobody .
i will chop her into messes !
oh , ’ tis foul in her .
that ’ s fouler .
get me some poison , propn , this night .
i ’ ll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again — this night , propn !
do it not with poison .
strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .
good , good , the justice of it pleases !
very good !
and for propn , let me be his undertaker .
you shall hear more by midnight .
excellent good .
those are the raisèd father and his friends .
you were best go in .
not i , i must be found .
my parts , my title , and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly .
is it they ?
by propn , i think no .
the servants of the propn and my lieutenant ?
the goodness of the night upon you , friends !
what is the news ?
the propn does greet you , general , and he requires your haste - post - haste appearance , even on the instant .
what ’ s the matter , think you ?
something from propn as i may divine .
it is a business of some heat .
the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another ’ s heels , and many of the consuls , raised and met , are at the propn propn already .
you have been hotly called for .
when being not at your lodging to be found the propn hath sent about three several guests to search you out .
propn well i am found by you .
i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you .
what trumpet is that same ?
i warrant something from propn .
see , your wife ’ s with him .
save you , worthy general !
the duke and senators of propn greet you .
and what ’ s the news , good cousin propn ?
i am very glad to see you , signior .
welcome to propn .
i thank you .
how does lieutenant propn ?
lives , sir .
are you sure of that ?
my lord ?
he did not call , he ’ s busy in the paper .
is there division propn my lord and propn ?
a most unhappy one .
i would do much propn ' atone them , for the love i bear to propn .
fire and brimstone !
my lord ?
are you wise ?
what , is he angry ?
maybe the letter moved him , for , as i think , they do command him home , propn propn in his government .
trust me , i am glad on propn .
indeed !
my lord ?
i am glad to see you mad .
why , sweet propn i have not deserved this .
my lord , this would not be believed in propn , propn i should swear i saw propn .
propn very much .
make her amends , she weeps .
oh , propn , propn !
out of my sight !
i will not stay to offend you .
truly , an obedient lady .
i do beseech your lordship , call her back .
propn !
my lord ?
what would you with her , sir ?
who , i , my lord ?
ay , you did wish that i would make her turn .
propn , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , and turn again .
and she can weep , sir , weep .
and she ’ s obedient , as you say , obedient , very obedient .— proceed you in your tears.— concerning this , sir — oh , well - painted passion ! — i am commanded home .— get you away , i ’ ll send for you anon .— propn , i obey the mandate and will return to propn .— hence , avaunt !
propn shall have my place .
and , sir , tonight i do entreat that we may sup together .
you are welcome , sir , to propn .
goats and monkeys !
is this the noble propn whom our full senate call all in all sufficient ?
he is much changed .
are his wits safe ?
is he not light of brain ?
he ’ s that he is .
i may not breathe my censure what he might be .
if what he might he is not , i would to propn he were !
strike his wife ?
faith , that was not so well .
yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst !
is it his use ?
or did the letters work upon his blood and new - create his fault ?
alas , alas !
it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known .
do but go after and mark how he continues .
i am sorry that i am deceived in him .
you have seen nothing then ?
nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
yes , you have seen propn and she together .
but then i saw no harm , and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them .
what , did they never whisper ?
never , my lord .
nor send you out o ' th ' way ?
never .
to fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
never , my lord .
that ’ s strange .
i durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , propn down my soul at stake .
bid her come hither .
go .
she says enough , yet she ’ s a simple bawd that can not say as much .
and yet she ’ ll kneel and pray , i have seen her do propn .
my lord , what is your will ?
pray , chuck , come hither .
what is your pleasure ?
let me see your eyes .
look in my face .
what horrible fancy ’ s this ?
i understand a fury in your words , but not the words .
therefore be double damned , propn thou art honest !
heaven doth truly know it .
propn truly knows that thou art false as hell .
to whom , my lord ?
with whom ?
how am i false ?
ah , propn , away , away , away !
am i the motive of these tears , my lord ?
if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back , propn not your blame on me .
if you have lost him , why , i have lost him too .
yet could i bear that too , well , very well .
but there where i have garnered up my heart , where either i must live or bear no life , the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up — to be discarded thence !
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in !
turn thy complexion there , patience , thou young and rose - lipped cherubin , — ay , there , look grim as hell !
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
oh , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , that quicken even with blowing .
o thou weed , who art so lovely fair and propn so sweet that the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born !
alas , what ignorant sin have i committed ?
was this fair paper , this most goodly book , made to write “ whore ” upon ?
what committed ?
committed ?
o thou public commoner !
what committed ?
impudent strumpet !
by propn , you do me wrong !
are you not a strumpet ?
no , as i am a propn .
what , not a whore ?
no , as i shall be saved .
is ’ t possible ?
oh , propn forgive us !
i cry you mercy , then , i took you for that cunning whore of propn that married with propn .— you , mistress , that have the office opposite to propn propn and keep the gate of hell !
you , you , ay , you !
we have done our course .
there ’ s money for your pains .
i pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel .
alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
how do you , madam ?
ancient , what makes he here ?
faith , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack .
if it prove lawful prize , he ’ s made for ever .
i do not understand .
he ’ s married .
to who ?
here comes another troop to seek for you .
it is propn .
general , be advised , he comes to bad intent .
propn !
stand there !
propn , it is the propn .
down with him , thief !
with who ?
i have none .
do not talk to me , propn .
here ’ s a change indeed !
propn meet i should be used so , very meet .
how have i been behaved that he might stick the small ’ st opinion on my least misuse ?
what is your pleasure , madam ?
how is propn with you ?
i can not tell .
those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks .
he might have chid me so , for , in good faith , i am a child to chiding .
what is the matter , lady ?
alas , propn , my lord hath so bewhored her , propn such despite and heavy terms upon her , that true hearts can not bear it .
am i that name , propn ?
what name , fair lady ?
such as she says my lord did say i was .
why did he so ?
i do not know .
i am sure i am none such .
do not weep , do not weep .
propn the day !
propn she forsook so many noble matches , her father and her country , and her friends , to be called “ whore ” ?
would it not make one weep ?
it is my wretched fortune .
beshrew him for propn !
how comes this trick upon him ?
nay , propn doth know .
i will be hanged , if some eternal villain , some busy and insinuating rogue , some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , have not devised this slander .
i will be hanged else !
propn , there is no such man .
it is impossible .
if any such there be , propn pardon him !
why should he call her “ whore ” ?
who keeps her company ?
the propn ’ s abused by some most villainous knave , some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
o heavens , that such companions thou ’ dst unfold , and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to th ' west !
speak within door .
oh , fie upon them !
some such squire he was that turned your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the propn .
you are a fool .
go to .
propn propn , what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friend , go to him .
for , by this light of propn , i know not how i lost him .
here i kneel : if e'er my will did trespass ' gainst his love , either in discourse of thought or actual deed , or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense , delighted them , or any other form , or that i do not yet , and ever did ,
and ever will — though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement — love him dearly , propn forswear me !
unkindness may do much , and his unkindness may defeat my life , but never taint my love .
i can not say “ whore , ” it does abhor me now i speak the word .
the business of the state does him offence , and he does chide with you .
if ’ twere no other— ' propn but so , i warrant .
propn , how these instruments summon to supper .
the messengers of propn stays the meat .
go in , and weep not .
all things shall be well .
how now , propn !
i do not find that thou propn justly with me .
what in the contrary ?
i will indeed no longer endure it , nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered .
will you hear me , propn ?
i have heard too much , and your words and performances are no kin together .
you charge me most unjustly .
with naught but truth .
the jewels you have had from me to deliver propn would half have corrupted a votaress .
you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but i find none .
well , go to .
very well .
very well , ” “ go to ” !
i can not go to , man , nor ’ tis not very well .
nay , i think it is scurvy , and begin to find myself fopped in it .
very well .
i tell you ’ tis not very well .
i will make myself known to propn .
if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation .
if not , assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you .
you have said now .
ay , and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing .
why , now i see there ’ s mettle in thee , and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before .
give me thy hand , propn .
thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair .
it hath not appeared .
i grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment .
but , propn , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which i have greater reason to believe now than ever — i mean purpose , courage and valor — this night show it .
if thou the next night following enjoy not propn , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life .
well , what is it ?
is it within reason and compass ?
propn , there is especial commission come from propn to depute propn in propn ’ s place .
is that true ?
why , then propn and propn return again to propn .
how do you mean , removing of him ?
why , by making him uncapable of propn ’ s place : knocking out his brains .
and that you would have me to do !
ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right .
he sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will i go to him .
he knows not yet of his honorable fortune .
if you will watch his going thence ( which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one ) you may take him at your pleasure .
i will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us .
i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .
it is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste .
about it !
i will hear further reason for this .
and you shall be satisfied .
i do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
propn , good night .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
your honor is most welcome .
will you walk , sir ? — o desdemona— my lord ?
get you to bed on th ' instant , i will be returned propn .
dismiss your attendant there , look propn be done .
i will , my lord .
how goes it now ?
he looks gentler than he did .
dismiss me ?
it was his bidding .
therefore , good propn , give me my nightly wearing , and adieu .
we must not now displease him .
ay .
would you had never seen him !
so would not i .
my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness , his checks , his propn propn , unpin me — have grace and favor .
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
all ’ s one .
propn propn , how foolish are our minds !
if i do die before thee , prithee , shroud me in one of these same sheets .
come , come !
you talk !
she had a song of “ propn , ” an old thing ’ twas , but it expressed her fortune and she died singing it .
that song tonight will not go from my mind .
i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbary .
prithee , dispatch .
shall i go fetch your nightgown ?
no , unpin me here .
this propn is a proper man .
a very handsome man .
he speaks well .
i know a lady in propn would have walked barefoot to propn for a touch of his nether lip .
it ’ s the wind .
mine eyes do itch , doth that bode weeping ?
propn neither here nor there .
i have heard it said so .
oh , these men , these men !
dost thou in conscience think — tell me , emilia— that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind ?
there be some such , no question .
you , propn !
come , sir , i am for you .
good signior , you shall more command with years than with your weapons .
o thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter ?
damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her !
judge me the world if ’ tis not gross in sense that thou hast practiced on her with foul charms , abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weakens motion .
if he do resist , propn him at his peril !
propn will you that i go to answer this your charge ?
propn thou do such a deed for all the world ?
why , would not you ?
no , by this heavenly light !
nor i neither , by this heavenly light .
i might do propn as well i ' th ' dark .
propn thou do such a deed for all the world ?
the world ’ s a huge thing .
it is a great price for a small vice .
in troth , i think thou wouldst not .
in troth , i think i should , and undo propn when i had done .
marry , i would not do such a thing for a joint - ring , nor for measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition .
but for the whole world ?
why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ?
i should venture purgatory for propn .
beshrew me , if i would do such a wrong for the whole world .
why the wrong is but a wrong i ' th ' world , and having the world for your labor , ’ tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
i do not think there is any such woman .
yes , a dozen , and as many to th ' vantage as would store the world they played for .
but i do think it is their husbands ' faults if wives do fall .
say that they slack their duties
why , we have galls , and though we have some grace , yet have we some revenge .
let husbands know their wives have sense like them .
they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour , as husbands have .
i think it is .
and doth affection breed it ?
i think it doth .
is ’ t frailty that thus errs ?
it is so too .
and have not we affections , desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
then let them use us well , else let them know , the ills we do , their ills instruct us so .
good night , good night .
propn me such uses send , not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !
here , stand behind this bulk , straight will he come .
quick , quick !
fear nothing .
i ’ ll be at thy elbow .
it makes us , or it mars us .
here , at thy hand .
be bold , and take thy stand .
i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons .
propn but a man gone .
i know his gait , ’ tis he .— propn , thou diest !
oh , i am slain !
i am maimed for ever .
help , ho !
murder !
murder !
the voice of propn .
propn keeps his word .
oh , villain that i am !
it is even so .
oh , help , ho !
light !
a surgeon !
propn he .
oh , brave propn , honest and just , that hast such noble sense of thy friend ’ s wrong !
thou teachest me .
minion , your dear lies dead , and your unblest fate hies .
propn , i come .
for , of my heart , those charms , thine eyes , are blotted .
thy bed , lust - stained , shall with lust ’ s blood be spotted .
what , ho !
no watch ?
no passage ?
murder !
murder !
propn some mischance , the cry is very direful .
oh , help !
propn !
oh , wretched villain !
two or three groan .
propn heavy night , these may be counterfeits .
let ’ s think propn unsafe to come in to the cry without more help .
nobody come ?
then shall i bleed to death .
propn !
here ’ s one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
who ’ s there ?
whose noise is this that ones on murder ?
we do not know .
do not you hear a cry ?
here , here !
for propn ’ s sake , help me !
the same indeed , a very valiant fellow .
iago ?
oh , i am spoiled , undone by villains !
give me some help .
oh , me , lieutenant !
what villains have done this ?
i think that one of them is hereabout , and can not make away .
that ’ s one of them .
o damned propn !
o inhuman dog !
kill men i ' th ' dark !
where be these bloody thieves ?
are you of good or evil ?
as you shall prove us , praise us .
propn propn ?
he , sir .
i cry you mercy .
here ’ s propn hurt by villains .
propn !
how is propn , brother !
my leg is cut in two .
propn , propn forbid !
light , gentlemen , i ’ ll bind it with my shirt .
what is the matter , ho ?
who is propn that cried ?
who is propn that cried ?
oh , my dear propn !
my sweet propn !
o propn , propn , propn !
o notable strumpet !
propn , may you suspect who they should be that have thus mangled you ?
no .
i am sorry to find you thus .
i have been to seek you .
alas , he faints !
o propn , propn , propn !
gentlemen all , i do suspect this trash to be a party in this injury.— patience awhile , good propn .— come , come , lend me a light .
know we this face or no ?
even he , sir .
did you know him ?
know him ?
ay .
i am glad to see you .
how do you , propn ? — oh , a chair , a chair !
propn !
he , he , ’ tis he .
oh , that ’ s well said — the chair !
some good man bear him carefully from hence .
i ’ ll fetch the general ’ s surgeon.— save you your labor .— he that lies slain here , propn , was my dear friend .
what malice was between you ?
none in the world , nor do i know the man .
i pray you , look upon her .
do you see , gentlemen ?
nay , guiltiness will speak , though tongues were out of use .
alas , what is the matter ?
what is the matter , husband ?
propn hath here been set on in the dark by propn and fellows that are ’ scaped .
he ’ s almost slain , and propn dead .
alas , good gentleman !
alas , good propn !
this is the fruits of whoring .
prithee , propn , go know of propn where he supped tonight.—
he supped at my house , but i therefore shake not .
oh , did he so ?
i charge you , go with me .
oh , fie upon thee , strumpet !
as i !
propn upon thee !
kind gentlemen , let ’ s go see poor propn dressed.— come , mistress , you must tell propn another tale .
emilia , run you to the citadel and tell my lord and lady what hath happed.— will you go on afore ?
this is the night that either makes me or fordoes me quite .
how may the propn be therewith satisfied , whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him ?
propn true , most worthy signior .
the propn propn in council and your noble self , i am sure , is sent for .
the propn in council ?
in this time of the night ?
bring him away .
mine ’ s not an idle cause .
the propn himself , or any of my brothers of the state , can not but feel this wrong as ’ twere their own .
for if such actions may have passage free , bond - slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
let me not name it to you , you chaste stars , it is the cause .
yet i ’ ll not shed her blood , nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster .
yet she must die , else she ’ ll betray more men .
put out the light , and then put out the light .
if i quench thee , thou flaming minister , i can again thy former light restore should i repent me .
when i have plucked thy rose i can not give it vital growth again , it must needs wither .
who ’ s there ?
othello ?
ay , propn .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
ay , my lord .
propn , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
well , do it , and be brief .
i will walk by .
i would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit .
no , heavens forfend , i would not kill thy soul !
talk you of killing ?
ay , i do .
then propn have mercy on me !
amen , with all my heart .
if you say , i hope you will not kill me .
propn !
why i should fear i know not , since guiltiness i know not .
but yet i feel i fear .
think on thy sins .
they are loves i bear to you .
ay , and for that thou diest .
that death ’ s unnatural that kills for loving .
alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
some bloody passion shakes your very frame .
these are portents , but yet i hope , i hope they do not point on me .
i will so .
what ’ s the matter ?
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee , thou gav ’ st to propn .
no , by my life and soul !
send for the man and ask him .
thou art on thy deathbed .
ay — but not yet to die !
presently .
therefore confess thee freely of thy sin , for to deny each article with oath can not remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal .
thou art to die .
oh , propn have mercy on me !
i say “ amen . ”
and have you mercy too !
i never gave him token .
by propn , i saw my handkerchief in ’ s hand .
o perjured woman , thou dost stone my heart , and propn me call what i intend to do a murder , which i thought a sacrifice !
i saw the handkerchief .
he hath confessed .
what , my lord ?
that he hath usèd thee .
how ?
ay .
he will not say so .
no , his mouth is stopped .
propn propn propn ta'en order for propn .
what , is he dead ?
had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all .
alas , he is betrayed and i undone .
oh , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
kill me tomorrow — let me live tonight !
nay , if you strive— but half an hour !
but while i say one prayer !
it is too late .
what noise is this ? — not dead ?
not yet quite dead ?
who ’ s there ?
yes , ’ tis propn ' propn like she comes to speak of propn ’ s death , the noise was high .
what ’ s the matter with thee now ?
but now , my lord .
propn , my lord , hath killed a young propn called propn .
propn killed ?
and propn killed !
no , propn is not killed .
not propn killed !
then murder ’ s out of tune , and sweet revenge grows harsh .
oh , falsely , falsely murdered !
alas , what cry is that ?
that ?
what ?
out and alas , that was my lady ’ s voice .
help !
help , ho , help !
o lady , speak again !
propn propn !
o sweet mistress , speak !
a guiltless death i die .
oh , who hath done this deed ?
nobody .
i myself .
commend me to my kind lord .
oh , farewell !
why , how should she be murdered ?
alas , who knows ?
you heard her say herself it was not i .
she said so .
i must needs report the truth .
she ’ s like a liar gone to burning hell .
propn i that killed her .
oh , the more angel she , and you the blacker devil !
she turned to folly , and she was a whore .
thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
she was false as water .
oh , she was heavenly true !
propn did top her , ask thy husband else .
oh , i were damned beneath all depth in hell , but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity .
propn husband knew it all .
my husband !
propn husband .
that she was false to wedlock ?
ay , with propn .
had she been true , if propn would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite , i ’ d not have sold her for it .
my husband ?
ay , ’ twas he that told me on her first .
an honest man he is , and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds .
my husband !
what needs this iterance , woman ?
i say thy husband .
o mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love !
my husband say that she was false !
he , woman .
i say “ thy husband ” —dost understand the word ?
my friend , thy husband , honest , honest iago .
if he say so , may his pernicious soul propn half a grain a day !
he lies to th ' heart .
she was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
ha !
do thy worst .
this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her .
peace , you were best .
o gull !
o dolt !
as ignorant as dirt !
thou hast done a deed— i care not for thy sword , i ’ ll make thee known
the propn hath killed my mistress !
murder , murder !
what is the matter ?
how now , general ?
oh , are you come , propn ?
you have done well , that men must lay their murders on your neck .
what is the matter ?
i told him what i thought , and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true .
but did you ever tell him she was false ?
i did .
you told a lie , an odious , damnèd lie .
upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie .
she false with propn !
did you say with propn ?
with propn , mistress .
go to , charm your tongue .
my mistress here lies murdered in her bed— oh , heavens forfend !
there ’ s no composition in this news that gives them credit .
indeed , they are disproportioned .
my letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
and mine a hundred and forty .
and mine , two hundred .
but though they jump not on a just account— as in these cases , where the aim reports ' propn oft with difference — yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet , and bearing up to propn .
nay , it is possible enough to judgment .
a messenger from the galleys .
and your reports have set the murder on .
i thought so then , i ’ ll kill myself for grief .
oh , villainy , villainy !
what , are you mad ?
i charge you , get you home .
good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak .
propn proper i obey him , but not now .
perchance , propn , i will ne'er go home .
oh !
oh !
oh !
nay , lay thee down and roar , for thou hast killed the sweetest innocent that e'er did lift up eye .
oh , she was foul ! — i scarce did know you , uncle .
i am glad thy father ’ s dead , propn match was mortal to him , and pure grief propn his old thread in twain .
did he live now ,
this sight would make him do a desperate turn , propn , curse his better angel from his side and fall to reprobation .
propn pitiful , but yet propn knows that she with propn hath the act of shame a thousand times committed .
zounds , hold your peace .
let heaven and men and devils , let them all , all , all cry shame against me , yet i ’ ll speak .
be wise , and get you home .
i will not .
fie !
your sword upon a woman ?
o thou dull propn !
that handkerchief thou speak ’ st of i found by fortune and did give my husband .
for often , with a solemn earnestness— more than indeed belonged to such a trifle— he begged of me to steal it .
villainous whore !
she give it propn ?
no , alas , i found it and i did give propn my husband .
propn , thou liest !
by propn , i do not , i do not , gentlemen.— o murderous coxcomb !
are there no stones in propn but what serve for the thunder ? — precious villain !
sure he hath killed his wife .
ay , ay .
oh , lay me by my mistress ' side .
he ’ s gone , but his wife propn killed .
let him not pass , but kill him rather .
but why should honor outlive honesty ?
let it go all .
what did thy song bode , lady ?
propn , canst thou hear me ?
i will play the swan .
and die in music .
oh , here it is .
propn , i must come forth .
look in upon me then and speak with me , or , naked as i am , i will assault thee .
what is the matter ?
propn , i have a weapon .
that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop .
but , oh , vain boast !
who can control his fate ?
tis not so now .
be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed .
here is my journey ’ s end , here is my butt , and very sea - mark of my utmost sail .
do you go back dismayed ?
tis a lost fear .
where should othello go ? — now , how dost thou look now ?
o ill - starred wench , propn as thy smock !
when we shall meet at compt this look of thine will hurl my soul from propn and fiends will snatch at it .
cold , cold , my girl , even like thy chastity .
o cursed , cursed slave !
whip me , ye devils , from the possession of this heavenly sight !
where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?
that ’ s he that was propn .
here i am .
where is that viper ?
bring the villain forth .
i take it much unkindly that thou , propn , who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this .
sblood , but you ’ ll not hear me !
thou told ’ st me thou didst hold him in thy hate .
despise me if i do not .
i look down towards his feet , but that ’ s a fable .
if that thou be ’ st a devil , i can not kill thee .
wrench his sword from him .
i bleed , sir , but not killed .
i am not sorry neither .
i ’ d have thee live , for in my sense ’ tis happiness to die .
why , anything .
this wretch hath part confessed his villainy .
did you and he consent in propn ’ s death ?
ay .
dear general , i never gave you cause .
i do believe it , and i ask your pardon .
will you , i pray , demand that demi - devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
demand me nothing .
what you know , you know .
from this time forth i never will speak word .
what , not to pray ?
well , thou dost best .
the one of them imports the death of propn to be undertook by propn .
oh , villain !
most heathenish and most gross !
o thou pernicious caitiff !
how came you , propn , by that handkerchief that was my wife ’ s ?
i found it in my chamber , and he himself confessed but even now that there he dropped it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire .
your power and your command is taken off and propn rules in propn .
for this slave , if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long , it shall be his .
you shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state .— come , bring him away .
nothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice .
then must you speak of one that loved not wisely , but too well .
of one not easily jealous , but being wrought , perplexed in the extreme .
of one whose hand , like the base propn , threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe .
set you down this ,
and say besides that in propn once , where a malignant and a turbaned propn beat a propn and traduced the state , i took by the throat the circumcisèd dog , and smote him , thus .
oh , bloody period !
all that is spoke is marred .
this did i fear , but thought he had no weapon , for he was great of heart .
how say you by this change ?
this can not be , by no assay of reason .
propn a pageant , to keep us in false gaze .
here is more news .
ay , so i thought .
how many , as you guess ?
of thirty sail .
and now they do re - stem their backward course , bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward propn .
propn propn , your trusty and most valiant servitor , with his free duty recommends you thus , and prays you to believe him .
propn certain then for propn .
propn propn , is not he in town ?
he ’ s now in propn .
write from us to him .
post - post - haste , dispatch .
here comes propn and the valiant propn .
good your grace , pardon me .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
my daughter !
oh , my daughter !
dead ?
ay , to me .
whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding propn thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her , the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter , after your own sense , yea , though our proper son propn in your action .
humbly i thank your grace .
we are very sorry for ’ t .
nothing , but this is so .
the very head and front of my offending propn this extent , no more .
more than pertains to feats of broils and battle , and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself .
a maiden never bold , of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself .
against all rules of nature , and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be .
i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood or with some dram , conjured to this effect , he wrought upon her .
but , propn , speak .
or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth ?
and let her speak of me before her father .
fetch propn hither .
you best know the place .
and till she come , as truly as to propn i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i ’ ll present how i did thrive in this fair lady ’ s love and she in mine .
say it , propn .
her father loved me , oft invited me , still questioned me the story of my life from year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , that i have passed .
these things to hear would propn seriously incline .
she wished she had not heard it , yet she wished that propn had made her such a man .
she thanked me and bade me , if i had a friend that loved her , i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her .
upon this hint i spake .
she loved me for the dangers i had passed , and i loved her that she did pity them .
this only is the witchcraft i have used .
here comes the lady .
let her witness it .
i think this tale would win my daughter too .
i pray you , hear her speak .
if she confess that she was half the wooer , destruction on my head if my bad blame propn on the man .— come hither , gentle mistress .
do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience ?
my noble father , i do perceive here a divided duty .
to you i am bound for life and education .
you are the lord of duty .
i am hitherto your daughter .
i have done .
please it your grace , on to the state affairs .
i had rather to adopt a child than get it.— come hither , propn .
i here do give thee that with all my heart which , but thou hast already , with all my heart i would keep from thee .
for thy escape would teach me tyranny , to hang clogs on them .— i have done , my lord .
let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which , as a grise or step , may help these lovers .
i humbly beseech you , proceed to th ' affairs of state .
the propn with a most mighty preparation makes for propn .
why , at her father propn .
i ’ ll not have it so .
nor i .
most gracious propn , to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice , propn ' assist my simpleness .
what would you , propn ?
that i did love the propn to live with him , my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world .
i saw propn ’ s visage in his mind , and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate .
let me go with him .
let her have your voice .
be it as you shall privately determine , either for her stay or going .
th ' affair cries haste and speed must answer it .
you must away tonight .
with all my heart .
at nine i ' th ' morning here we ’ ll meet again .
othello , leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you , and such things else of quality and respect as doth import you .
to his conveyance i assign my wife , with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me .
wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he .
mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership .
why , there ’ s no remedy .
propn the curse of service .
now sir , be judge yourself , whether i in any just term am affined to love the propn .
i would not follow him then .
o sir , content you .
i follow him to serve my turn upon him .
we can not all be masters , nor all masters can not be truly followed .
you shall mark many a duteous and knee - crooking knave that ( doting on his own obsequious bondage ) wears out his time much like his master ’ s ass for naught but provender , and when he ’ s old , cashiered .
whip me such honest knaves .
these fellows have some soul ,
let it be so .
propn propn well .
look to her , propn , if thou hast eyes to see .
she has deceived her father , and may thee .
my life upon her faith ! —honest propn , my propn must i leave to thee .
i prithee , let thy wife attend on her , and bring them after in the best advantage .
come , propn , i have but an hour of love , of worldly matter and direction , to spend with thee .
we must obey the time .
iago .
what propn thou , noble heart ?
what will i do , think ’ st thou ?
why , go to bed , and sleep .
i will incontinently drown myself .
if thou dost i shall never love thee after .
why , thou silly gentleman !
oh , villainous !
i have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself .
propn i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , i would change my humanity with a baboon .
what should i do ?
i confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it .
virtue ?
a fig !
propn in ourselves that we are thus or thus .
our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners .
so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many — either to have it sterile with idleness , or manured with industry — why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills .
if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions .
but we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts .
it can not be .
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
come , be a man .
drown thyself ?
drown cats and blind puppies !
i have professed me thy friend , and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness .
i could never better stead thee than now .
put money in thy purse .
these moors are changeable in their wills — fill thy purse with money .
the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida .
she must change for youth .
therefore , put money in thy purse .
if thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
make all the money thou canst .
if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle propn be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her .
a pox of drowning thyself !
propn clean out of the way .
thou art sure of me .
go , make money .
i have told thee often , and i re - tell thee again and again , i hate the propn .
let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .
propn , go , provide thy money .
we will have more of this tomorrow .
propn .
where shall we meet i ' th ' morning ?
at my lodging .
i ’ ll be with thee betimes .
no more of drowning , do you hear ?
i am changed .
go to , farewell .
put money enough in your purse .
i ’ ll sell all my land .
thus do i ever make my fool my purse .
for i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit .
i hate the propn , and it is thought abroad that ’ twixt my sheets he ’ s done my office .
i know not if propn be true , but i , for mere suspicion in that kind , will do as if for surety .
he holds me well .
propn propn a proper man .
let me see now ,
to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery .
how ?
how ?
let ’ s see .
i have propn .
what from the cape can you discern at sea ?
nothing at all .
it is a high - wrought flood .
methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements .
what shall we hear of this ?
a segregation of the turkish fleet .
for do but stand upon the foaming shore , the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , the wind - shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , seems to cast water on the burning bear , and quench the guards of th ' ever - fixèd pole .
i never did like molestation view on the enchafèd flood .
if that the turkish fleet be not ensheltered and embayed , they are drowned .
it is impossible they bear it out .
news , lads , our wars are done !
the desperate tempest hath so banged the propn , that their designment halts .
a noble ship of propn propn seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet .
how ?
is this true ?
propn propn , propn to the warlike propn propn , is come on shore .
the propn himself at sea and is in full commission here for propn .
i am glad on propn .
propn a worthy governor .
for they were parted with foul and violent tempest .
pray heavens he be , for i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier .
come , let ’ s do so .
for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance .
thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the propn .
oh , let the heavens give him defense against the elements , for i have lost him on a dangerous sea .
is he well shipped ?
his bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , stand in bold cure .
what noise ?
i pray you sir , go forth and give us truth who propn that is arrived .
i shall .
but good lieutenant , is your general wived ?
propn one propn , ancient to the general .
what is she ?
oh , behold , the riches of the ship is come on shore !
you men of propn , let her have your knees .
hail to thee , lady , and the grace of propn , before , behind thee , and on every hand , propn thee round !
i thank you , valiant propn .
what tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
he is not yet arrived .
nor know i aught but that he ’ s well and will be shortly here .
oh , but i fear .
how lost you company ?
the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship— but , hark !
see for the news .
for , sir , it is as sure as you are propn , were i the propn , i would not be propn .
i am not what i am .
do , with like timorous accent and dire yell as when , by night and negligence , the fire is spied in populous cities .
what , ho , propn !
propn propn , ho !
thieves !
thieves !
look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
thieves !
thieves !
propn , would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me , you ’ ll have enough .
i find it still , when i have leave to sleep .
marry , before your ladyship , i grant , she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking .
you have little cause to say so .
come on , come on .
you are pictures out of door , bells in your parlors , wild - cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .
oh , fie upon thee , slanderer !
nay , it is true , or else i am a propn .
you rise to play and go to bed to work .
no , let me not .
what wouldst thou write of me , if thou should ’ st praise me ?
o gentle lady , do not put me to propn , for i am nothing , if not critical .
come on , assay .
ay , madam .
i am not merry , but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise .
come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
well praised !
if she be black , and thereto have a wit , she ’ ll find a white that shall her blackness fit .
worse and worse !
how if fair and foolish ?
oh , heavy ignorance !
thou praisest the worst best .
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
she that was ever fair and never proud , had tongue at will and yet was never loud , never lacked gold and yet went never gay , fled from her wish and yet said “ now i may , ” she that being angered , her revenge being nigh , propn her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod ’ s head for the salmon ’ s tail , she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind , see suitors following and not look behind , she was a wight , if ever such wights were— to do what ?
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
oh , most lame and impotent conclusion !
do not learn of him , propn , though he be thy husband .
how say you , propn ?
is he not a most profane and liberal counselor ?
he speaks home , madam .
you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
i know his trumpet .
propn truly so .
let ’ s meet him and receive him .
propn , where he comes !
oh my fair warrior !
my dear othello !
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me .
oh , my soul ’ s joy !
if it were now to die , ' twere now to be most happy , for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this propn in unknown fate .
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase , even as our days do grow .
amen to that , sweet powers !
i can not speak enough of this content .
it stops me here , it is too much of joy .
come , let us to the castle .
news , friends !
our wars are done , the propn are drowned .
how does my old acquaintance of this propn propn , you shall be well desired in propn , i have found great love amongst them .
bring thou the master to the citadel .
he is a good one , and his worthiness does challenge much respect .— come , propn , once more , well met at propn .
do thou meet me presently at the harbor .— come hither .
the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard .
first , i must tell thee this : propn is directly in love with him .
with him ?
why , ’ tis not possible .
lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .
all which the propn is defective in .
now sir , this granted — as it is a most pregnant and unforced position — who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as propn does ?
besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after .
i can not believe that in her .
she ’ s full of most blessed condition .
the wine she drinks is made of grapes .
if she had been blessed , she would never have loved the propn .
blessed pudding !
didst not mark that ?
they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
pish !
but , sir , be you ruled by me .
i have brought you from propn .
watch you tonight for the command , i ’ ll lay propn upon you .
propn knows you not .
i ’ ll not be far from you .
do you find some occasion to anger propn , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .
well .
propn , he ’ s rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you .
provoke him that he may .
for even out of that will i cause these of propn to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of propn .
i will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity .
i warrant thee .
meet me by and by at the citadel .
i must fetch his necessaries ashore .
propn .
propn .
the thought whereof propn , like a poisonous mineral , gnaw my inwards , and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him , wife for wife .
or , failing so , yet that i put the propn at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment can not cure .
for besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .
all offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven .
bless the isle of propn and our noble general othello !
propn is most honest .
propn , good night .
tomorrow with your earliest let me have speech with propn come , my dear love , the purchase made , the fruits are to ensue : that profit ’ s yet to come ’ tween me and you .
good night .
welcome , propn .
we must to the watch .
our general cast us thus early for the love of his propn — who let us not therefore blame .
what is the reason of this terrible summons ?
what is the matter there ?
propn , is all your family within ?
are your doors locked ?
why , wherefore ask you this ?
zounds , sir , you ’ re robbed !
for shame , put on your gown .
your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul .
even now , now , very now , an old black ram is tupping your white ewe .
arise , arise , propn the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you .
arise , i say !
what , have you lost your wits ?
most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?
not i .
what are you ?
my name is propn .
i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors .
in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee .
propn , sir , sir—
indeed she ’ s a most fresh and delicate creature .
what an eye she has !
an inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
and when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
she is indeed perfection .
well , happiness to their sheets !
not tonight , good propn .
i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking .
i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
oh , they are our friends .
but one cup .
i ’ ll drink for you .
i have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily qualified too , and behold what innovation it makes here .
what , man , ’ tis a night of revels !
the gallants desire it .
where are they ?
here at the door .
i pray you call them in .
i ’ ll do propn , but it dislikes me .
if i can fasten but one cup upon him , with that which he hath drunk tonight already , he ’ ll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress ' dog .
now ’ mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our propn in some action that may offend the isle .
but here they come .
if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
fore propn , they have given me a rouse already .
good faith , a little one , not past a pint , as i am a soldier .
some wine , ho !
fore propn , an excellent song .
i learned it in propn where indeed they are most potent in potting .
your propn , your german , and your swag - bellied propn — propn , ho ! —are nothing to your propn .
is your propn so expert in his drinking ?
why , he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your propn .
to the health of our general !
i am for it , lieutenant , and i ’ ll do you justice .
oh , sweet propn !
why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .
will you hear propn again ?
no , for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things .
well , propn propn above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .
it ’ s true , good lieutenant .
for mine own part , no offence to the general nor any man of quality , i hope to be saved .
and so do i too , lieutenant .
ay , but ( by your leave ) not before me .
the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient .
let ’ s have no more of this , let ’ s to our affairs .— forgive us our sins ! —gentlemen , let ’ s look to our business .
do not think , gentlemen , i am drunk .
i am not drunk now .
i can stand well enough , and i speak well enough .
excellent well !
why , very well then .
you must not think then that i am drunk .
propn pity of him .
but is he often thus ?
propn evermore the prologue to his sleep .
he ’ ll watch the propn a double set if drink rock not his cradle .
it were well the general were put in mind of it .
is not this true ?
and ’ tis great pity that the noble propn should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity .
it were an honest action to say so to the propn .
why , so .
now have i done a good day ’ s work .
you peers , continue this united league .
dissemble not your hatred .
swear your love .
and with my hand i seal my true heart ’ s love .
and i as i love propn with my heart .
you have been factious one against the other.— propn , love propn propn .
dorset , embrace him .— propn , love propn propn .
this interchange of love , i here protest , upon my part shall be inviolable .
and so swear i .
now , princely propn , seal thou this league with thy embracements to my wife ’ s allies and make me happy in your unity .
a pleasing cordial , princely propn , is this thy vow unto my sickly heart .
and in good time , here comes propn propn propn and the duke .
good morrow to my sovereign king and queen , and , princely peers , a happy time of day .
happy indeed , as we have spent the day .
a blessèd labor , my most sovereign lord .
propn death to me to be at enmity ; i hate it , and desire all good men ’ s love .
a holy day shall this be kept hereafter .
i would to propn all strifes were well compounded .
my sovereign lord , i do beseech your highness to take our brother propn to your grace .
why , madam , have i offered love for this , to be so flouted in this royal presence ?
who knows not that the gentle duke is dead ?
who knows not he is dead !
who knows he is ?
all - seeing propn , what a world is this !
look i so pale , propn propn , as the rest ?
is clarence dead ?
the order was reversed .
but he , poor man , by your first order died , and that a wingèd propn did bear .
some tardy cripple bear the countermand , that came too lag to see him burièd .
propn grant that some , less noble and less loyal , propn in bloody thoughts , and not in blood , deserve not worse than wretched propn did , and yet go current from suspicion .
i prithee , peace .
my soul is full of sorrow .
i will not rise unless your propn hear me .
then say at once what is it thou requests .
the forfeit , sovereign , of my servant ’ s life , who slew today a riotous gentleman lately attendant on the duke of propn .
we know thy charge , propn , and will obey .
we are the queen ’ s abjects and must propn propn , farewell .
i know it pleaseth neither of us well .
well , your imprisonment shall not be long .
i will deliver you or else lie for you .
meantime , have patience .
i must perforce .
propn .
go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return .
simple , plain propn , i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to propn , if propn will take the present at our hands .
but who comes here ?
good time of day unto my gracious lord .
as much unto my good propn propn .
well are you welcome to the open air .
how hath your lordship brooked imprisonment ?
my brother killed no man ; his fault was thought , and yet his punishment was bitter death .
who sued to me for him ?
this is the fruits of rashness .
propn you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen looked pale when they did hear of propn ' death ?
o , they did urge it still unto the king .
propn will revenge it .
come , lords , will you go to comfort propn with our company ?
we wait upon your grace .
good grandam , tell us , is our father dead ?
no , boy .
my pretty cousins , you mistake me both .
then , you conclude , my grandam , he is dead .
the king mine uncle is to blame for it .
propn will revenge it , whom i will importune with earnest prayers , all to that effect .
and so will i .
peace , children , peace .
the king doth love you well .
incapable and shallow innocents , you can not guess who caused your father ’ s death .
think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ?
ay , boy .
i can not think it .
propn , what noise is this ?
i ’ ll join with black despair against my soul and to myself become an enemy .
why grow the branches when the root is gone ?
why wither not the leaves that want their sap ?
if you will live , lament .
if die , be brief , that our swift - wingèd souls may catch the king propn , or , like obedient subjects , follow him to his new kingdom of ne'er - changing night .
o , what cause have i , propn being but a moiety of my moan , to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries !
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes , that i , being governed by the watery moon , may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world .
ah , for my husband , for my dear lord propn !
ah , for our father , for our dear lord propn !
alas for both , both mine , propn and propn !
what stay had i but propn ?
and he ’ s gone .
what stay had we but propn ?
and he ’ s gone .
and they are gone .
was never widow had so dear a loss .
were never orphans had so dear a loss .
was never mother had so dear a loss .
alas , i am the mother of these griefs .
she for an propn weeps , and so do i ; i for a propn weep ; so doth not she .
these babes for propn weep and so do i ; i for an propn weep ; so do not they .
propn , bethink you , like a careful mother , of the young prince your son .
in him your comfort lives .
sister , have comfort .
all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star , but none can help our harms by wailing them.— propn , my mother , i do cry you mercy ; i did not see your grace .
humbly on my knee i crave your blessing .
propn bless thee , and put meekness in thy breast , love , charity , obedience , and true duty .
you cloudy princes and heart - sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan , now cheer each other in each other ’ s love .
though we have spent our harvest of this king , we are to reap the harvest of his son .
the broken rancor of your high - swoll'n hates , but lately splintered , knit , and joined together , must gently be preserved , cherished , and kept .
propn good that with some little train propn from propn the young prince be fet propn to propn , to be crowned our king .
why “ with some little train , ” my propn of propn ?
i hope the king made peace with all of us ; and the compact is firm and true in me .
and so in me , and so , i think , in all .
therefore i say with noble propn that it is meet so few should fetch the prince .
and so say i .
my lord , whoever journeys to the prince , for propn ’ s sake let not us two at home .
for by the way i ’ ll sort occasion , as index to the story we late talked of , to part the queen ’ s proud kindred from the prince .
my other self , my council ’ s consistory , my oracle , my prophet , my dear cousin , i , as a child , will go by thy direction toward propn then , for we ’ ll not stay behind .
good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
i promise you i scarcely know myself .
hear you the news abroad ?
yes , that the king is dead .
neighbors , propn speed .
give you good morrow , sir .
doth this news hold of good propn propn ’ s death ?
ay , sir , it is too true , propn help the while .
then , masters , look to see a troublous world .
no , no , by propn ’ s good grace , his son shall reign .
woe to the land that ’ s governed by a child .
in him there is a hope of government , which , in his nonage , council under him , and , in his full and ripened years , himself , no doubt shall then , and till then , govern well .
with patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
more pity that the eagle should be mewed while kites and buzzards prey at liberty .
what news abroad ?
propn very grievous to be thought upon .
where is he , in his bed ?
he is .
go you before , and i will follow you .
so stood the state when propn the propn was crowned in propn but at nine months old .
stood the state so ?
better it were they all came by his father , or by the father there were none at all , for emulation who shall now be nearest will touch us all too near if propn prevent not .
o , full of danger is the duke of propn , and the queen ’ s sons and brothers haught and proud , and were they to be ruled , and not to rule , this sickly land might solace as before .
come , come , we fear the worst .
all will be well .
untimely storms make men expect a dearth .
all may be well ; but if propn sort it so , ' propn more than we deserve or i expect .
before the days of change , still is it so .
but leave it all to propn .
whither away ?
marry , we were sent for to the justices .
tomorrow or next day they will be here .
i long with all my heart to see the prince .
i hope he is much grown since last i saw him .
ay , mother , but i would not have it so .
why , my young cousin ?
it is good to grow .
propn , one night as we did sit at supper , my uncle rivers talked how i did grow more than my brother : “ ay , ” quoth my uncle propn , “ small herbs have grace ; great weeds do grow apace . ” and since , methinks i would not grow so fast because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .
good faith , good faith , the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee !
he was the wretched ’ st thing when he was young , so long a - growing and so leisurely , that if this rule were true , he should be gracious .
and so no doubt he is , my gracious madam .
i hope he is , but yet let mothers doubt .
now , by my troth , if i had been remembered , i could have given my uncle ’ s grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touched mine .
how , my pretty york ?
i prithee let me hear it .
marry , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old .
twas full two years ere i could get a tooth .
propn , this would have been a biting jest .
i prithee , pretty propn , who told thee this ?
propn , his nurse .
his nurse ?
why , she was dead ere thou wast born .
if ’ twere not she , i can not tell who told me .
a parlous boy !
go to , you are too shrewd .
good madam , be not angry with the child .
pitchers have ears .
here comes a messenger .
what news ?
such news , my lord , as grieves me to report .
how doth the prince ?
well , madam , and in health .
what is thy news then ?
the mighty dukes , propn and propn .
for what offence ?
the sum of all i can , i have disclosed .
why , or for what , the nobles were committed is all unknown to me , my gracious lord .
ay me !
i see the ruin of my house .
welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre .
my husband lost his life to get the crown , and often up and down my sons were tossed for me to joy , and weep , their gain and loss .
o , preposterous and frantic outrage , end thy damnèd spleen , or let me die , to look on death no more .
the weary way hath made you melancholy .
no , uncle , but our crosses on the way have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy .
i want more uncles here to welcome me .
those uncles which you want were dangerous .
your grace attended to their sugared words but looked not on the poison of their hearts .
propn keep you from them , and from such false friends .
propn keep me from false friends , but they were none .
my lord , the mayor of propn comes to greet you .
propn bless your grace with health and happy days .
propn , what a slug is propn that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no !
and in good time here comes the sweating lord .
welcome , my lord .
what , will our mother come ?
on what occasion propn he knows , not i , the queen your mother and your brother propn have taken sanctuary .
the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace , but by his mother was perforce withheld .
not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin .
weigh it but with the grossness of this age , you break not sanctuary in seizing him .
this prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it and therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it .
propn have i heard of sanctuary men , but sanctuary children , ne'er till now .
my lord , you shall o'errule my mind for once.— come on , propn propn , will you go with me ?
i go , my lord .
good lords , make all the speedy haste you may .
say , uncle propn , if our brother come , where shall we sojourn till our coronation ?
where it seems best unto your royal self .
i do not like the propn , of any place.— did propn propn build that place , my lord ?
he did , my gracious lord , begin that place , which , since , succeeding ages have re - edified .
is it upon record , or else reported successively from age to age , he built it ?
upon record , my gracious lord .
but say , my lord , it were not registered , methinks the truth should live from age to age , as propn retailed to all posterity , even to the general all - ending day .
what say you , uncle ?
death makes no conquest of this conqueror , for now he lives in fame , though not in life .
he can not live , i hope , and must not die propn propn be packed with post - horse up to propn .
for then i ’ ll marry propn ’ s youngest daughter .
what though i killed her husband and her father ?
the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father ; the which will i , not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto .
but yet i run before my horse to market .
propn still breathes ; propn still lives and reigns .
when they are gone , then must i count my gains .
what , my gracious lord ?
propn of propn , how fares our loving brother ?
well , my dread lord — so must i call you now .
how fares our cousin , noble propn of propn ?
i thank you , gentle uncle .
o , my lord , you said that idle weeds are fast in growth .
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far .
he hath , my lord .
and therefore is he idle ?
o , my fair cousin , i must not say so .
then is he more beholding to you than i .
he may command me as my sovereign , but you have power in me as in a kinsman .
i pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
my dagger , little cousin ?
with all my heart .
a beggar , brother ?
of my kind uncle , that i know will give , and being but a toy , which is no grief to give .
a greater gift than that i ’ ll give my cousin .
a greater gift ?
o , that ’ s the sword to it .
ay , gentle cousin , were it light enough .
o , then i see you will part but with light gifts .
in weightier things you ’ ll say a beggar nay .
it is too heavy for your grace to wear .
i weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
how ?
propn , your grace knows how to bear with him .
you mean , to bear me , not to bear with me.— propn , my brother mocks both you and me .
i shall not sleep in quiet at the propn .
why , what should you fear ?
marry , my uncle propn ' angry ghost .
my grandam told me he was murdered there .
i fear no uncles dead .
nor none that live , i hope .
an if they live , i hope i need not fear .
no doubt , no doubt .
o , ’ tis a parlous boy , propn , quick , ingenious , forward , capable .
he is all the mother propn , from the top to toe .
well , let them rest .— come hither , propn .
he , for his father ’ s sake , so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him .
what think ’ st thou then of propn ?
will not he ?
he will do all in all as propn doth .
well then , no more but this : go , gentle propn , and , as it were far off , sound thou propn propn how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the propn to sit about the coronation .
if thou dost find him tractable to us , encourage him and show him all our reasons .
if he be leaden , icy , cold , unwilling , be thou so too , and so break off the talk , and give us notice of his inclination ; for we tomorrow hold divided councils , wherein thyself shalt highly be employed .
commend me to propn propn .
my good lords both , with all the heed i can .
shall we hear from you , propn , ere we sleep ?
you shall , my lord .
at propn propn , there shall you find us both .
now , my lord , what shall we do , if we perceive propn propn will not yield to our complots ?
chop off his head .
something we will determine .
and look when i am king , claim thou of me the earldom of propn , and all the moveables propn the king my brother was possessed .
i ’ ll claim that promise at your propn ’ s hands .
and look to have it yielded with all kindness .
come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form .
one from the propn propn .
upon the stroke of four .
can not my propn propn sleep these tedious nights ?
so it appears by that i have to say .
first , he commends him to your noble self .
what then ?
then certifies your lordship that this night he dreamt the boar had razèd his helm besides , he says there are two councils kept , and that may be determined at the one which may make you and him to rue at th ' other .
his honor and myself are at the one , and at the other is my good friend propn , where nothing can proceed that toucheth us propn i shall not have intelligence .
tell him his fears are shallow , without instance .
and for his dreams , i wonder he ’ s so simple to trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers .
to fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase .
many good morrows to my noble lord .
good morrow , propn .
you are early stirring .
what news , what news in this our tott'ring state ?
it is a reeling world indeed , my lord , and i believe will never stand upright till propn wear the garland of the realm .
how “ wear the garland ” ?
dost thou mean the crown ?
ay , my good lord .
i ’ ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders before i ’ ll see the crown so foul misplaced .
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ?
ay , on my life , and hopes to find you forward upon his party for the gain thereof ; and thereupon he sends you this good news , that this same very day your enemies , the kindred of the queen , must die at propn .
indeed , i am no mourner for that news , because they have been still my adversaries .
propn keep your lordship in that gracious mind .
well , propn , ere a fortnight make me older i ’ ll send some packing that yet think not on propn .
propn a vile thing to die , my gracious lord , when men are unprepared and look not for it .
o monstrous , monstrous !
and so falls it out with propn , propn , propn ; and so ’ twill do with some men else that think themselves as safe as thou and i , who , as thou know ’ st , are dear to princely propn and to propn .
the princes both make high account of you— i know they do , and i have well deserved it .
fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?
my lord , good morrow .
good morrow , propn you may jest on , but , by the propn propn , i do not like these several councils , i .
my lord , i hold my life as dear as you do yours , and never in my days , i do protest , was it so precious to me as ’ tis now .
think you but that i know our state secure , i would be so triumphant as i am ?
pray propn , i say , i prove a needless coward !
what , shall we toward the propn ?
the day is spent .
set down , set down your honorable load , if honor may be shrouded in a hearse , propn i awhile obsequiously lament propn ' untimely fall of virtuous propn .
propn you what , my lord ?
today the lords you talked of are beheaded .
they , for their truth , might better wear their heads than some that have accused them wear their hats .
but come , my lord , let ’ s away .
go on before .
i ’ ll talk with this good fellow .
how now , sirrah !
how goes the world with thee ?
the better that your lordship please to ask .
i tell thee , man , ’ tis better with me now than when thou propn me last where now we meet .
but now , i tell thee — keep it to thyself— this day those enemies are put to death , and i in better state than propn i was .
propn hold it , to your propn ’ s good content !
there , drink that for me .
i thank your honor .
well met , my lord .
i am glad to see your honor .
i thank thee , good propn propn , with all my heart .
i am in your debt for your last exercise .
come the next sabbath , and i will content you .
your friends at propn , they do need the priest ; your propn hath no shriving work in hand .
good faith , and when i met this holy man , the men you talk of came into my mind .
what , go you toward the propn ?
i shall return before your lordship thence .
nay , like enough , for i stay dinner there .
i ’ ll wait upon your lordship .
dispatch .
the limit of your lives is out .
o propn , propn !
o thou bloody prison , fatal and ominous to noble peers !
now propn ’ s curse is fall'n upon our heads , when she exclaimed on propn , you , and i , for standing by when propn stabbed her son .
then cursed she propn .
o , remember , propn , to hear her prayer for them , as now for us !
and for my sister and her princely sons , be satisfied , dear propn , with our true blood , which , as thou know ’ st , unjustly must be spilt .
make haste .
the hour of death is expiate .
come , propn .
come , propn .
let us all embrace .
in propn ’ s name , speak .
when is the royal day ?
is all things ready for the royal time ?
it is , and wants but nomination .
tomorrow , then , i judge a happy day .
who knows the propn propn ’ s mind herein ?
who is most inward with the noble duke ?
your grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
we know each other ’ s faces ; for our hearts , he knows no more of mine than i of yours , or i of his , my lord , than you of mine.— propn propn , you and he are near in love .
i thank his grace .
i know he loves me well .
but for his purpose in the coronation , i have not sounded him , nor he delivered his gracious pleasure any way therein .
but you , my honorable lords , may name the time , and in the duke ’ s behalf i ’ ll give my voice , which i presume he ’ ll take in gentle part .
in happy time here comes the duke himself .
my noble lords and cousins all , good morrow .
had you not come upon your cue , my lord , propn propn propn had pronounced your part— i mean your voice for crowning of the king .
than my propn propn no man might be bolder .
propn of propn , a word with you .
i ’ ll go with you .
we have not yet set down this day of triumph .
where is my lord the duke of propn ?
i have sent for these strawberries .
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning .
there ’ s some conceit or other likes him well when that he bids good morrow with such spirit .
i think there ’ s never a man in propn can lesser hide his love or hate than he , for by his face straight shall you know his heart .
i pray propn he be not , i say .
then be your eyes the witness of their evil .
if they have done this deed , my noble lord— if ?
thou protector of this damnèd strumpet , propn thou to me of “ ifs ” ?
thou art a traitor— off with his head .
woe , woe for propn !
propn did dream the boar did raze his helm , and i did scorn it and disdain to fly .
three times today my foot - cloth horse did stumble , and started when he looked upon the propn , as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse .
o , now i need the priest that spake to me !
i now repent i told the pursuivant , as too triumphing , how mine enemies today at propn bloodily were butchered , and i myself secure in grace and favor .
o propn , propn , now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor propn ' wretched head .
make a short shrift .
he longs to see your head .
o momentary grace of mortal men , which we more hunt for than the grace of propn !
who builds his hopes in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast , ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep .
come , come , dispatch .
propn bootless to exclaim .
o bloody propn !
propn propn , i prophesy the propn time to thee that ever wretched age hath looked upon.— come , lead me to the block .
bear him my head .
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead .
propn looks are at my service , like enforcèd smiles , and both are ready in their offices , at any time to grace my stratagems .
but what , is propn gone ?
propn , o'erlook the walls .
if ever he have wife , let her be made more miserable by the death of him than i am made by my poor lord and thee.— come now towards propn with your holy load , taken from propn ’ s to be interrèd there .
what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds ?
propn propn , the reason we have sent— look back !
defend thee !
here are enemies .
propn and our innocence defend and guard us !
be patient .
they are friends , propn and propn .
here is the head of that ignoble traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected propn .
so dear i loved the man that i must weep .
so smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue that , his apparent open guilt omitted— i mean his conversation with propn ’ s wife— he lived from all attainder of suspects .
had he done so ?
what , think you we are propn or infidels ?
i never looked for better at his hands after he once fell in with propn propn .
but , my good lord , your graces ' words shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak ; and do not doubt , right noble princes both , but i ’ ll acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this case .
and to that end we wished your lordship here propn ' avoid the censures of the carping world .
moreover , urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust , which stretched to their servants , daughters , wives , even where his raging eye or savage heart , without control , lusted to make his prey .
nay , for a need , thus far come near my person : tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate propn , noble propn my princely father then had wars in propn , and , by true computation of the time , found that the issue was not his begot , which well appearèd in his lineaments , being nothing like the noble duke my father .
yet touch this sparingly , as ’ twere far off , because , my lord , you know my mother lives .
and so , my lord , adieu .
if you thrive well , bring them to propn ’ s propn , where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well - learnèd bishops .
i go ; and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the propn affords .
go , propn , with all speed to propn propn .
now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of propn out of sight , and to give order that no manner of person have any time recourse unto the princes .
this is the indictment of the good propn propn , which in a set hand fairly is engrossed , that it may be today read o'er in propn propn .
here ’ s a good world the while .
who is so gross that can not see this palpable device ?
bad is the world , and all will come to naught when such ill dealing must be seen in thought .
now , by the holy mother of our propn , the citizens are mum , say not a word .
touched you the bastardy of propn ’ s children ?
no .
his answer was , the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder .
would not they speak ?
will not the mayor then and his brethren come ?
the mayor is here at hand .
and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen , good my lord , for on that ground i ’ ll make a holy descant .
and be not easily won to our requests .
i go .
an if you plead as well for them as i can say “ nay ” to thee for myself , no doubt we bring it to a happy issue .
go , go , up to the leads .
the propn propn knocks .
welcome , my lord .
i think the duke will not be spoke withal .
now , propn , what says your lord to my request ?
he doth entreat your grace , my noble lord , to visit him tomorrow or next day .
propn , good propn , to the gracious duke .
tell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , no less importing than our general good , in deep designs , and matters of great moment are come to have some conference with his grace .
i ’ ll signify so much unto him straight .
ah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an propn !
he is not lolling on a lewd love bed , but on his knees at meditation ; not dallying with a brace of courtesans , but meditating with two deep divines ; not sleeping , to engross his idle body , but praying , to enrich his watchful soul .
happy were propn would this virtuous prince take on his grave the sovereignty thereof .
but sure i fear we shall not win him to it .
marry , propn defend his grace should say us nay !
i fear he will .
here propn comes again .
now , propn , what says his grace ?
he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to come to him , his grace not being warned thereof before .
he fears , my lord , you mean no good to him .
sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him .
when holy and devout religious men are at their beads , ’ tis much to draw them thence , so sweet is zealous contemplation .
see where his propn stands , ’ tween two clergymen .
my lord , there needs no such apology .
i do beseech your propn pardon me , who , earnest in the service of my propn , deferred the visitation of my friends .
i do suspect i have done some offense that seems disgracious in the city ’ s eye , and that you come to reprehend my ignorance .
you have , my lord .
sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , behold this pattern of thy butcheries .
o , gentlemen , see , see dead propn ’ s wounds open their congealed mouths and bleed propn propn , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , for ’ tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells .
o earth , which this blood drink ’ st revenge his death !
either propn with lightning strike the murderer dead , or earth gape open wide and eat him quick , as thou dost swallow up this good king ’ s blood , which his hell - governed arm hath butcherèd !
if not to answer , you might haply think tongue - tied ambition , not replying , yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , which fondly you would here impose on me .
first , if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth , yet so much is my poverty of spirit , so mighty and so many my defects , that i would rather hide me from my greatness , being a bark to brook no mighty sea , than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered .
but , propn be thanked , there is no need of me , and much i need to help you , were there need .
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit , which , mellowed by the stealing hours of time , will well become the seat of majesty , and make , no doubt , us happy by his reign .
on him i lay what you would lay on me , the right and fortune of his happy stars , which propn defend that i should wring from him .
for first was he contract to propn propn your mother lives a witness to that vow— and afterward by substitute betrothed to propn , sister to the king of propn .
these both put off , a poor petitioner , a care - crazed mother to a many sons , a beauty - waning and distressèd widow , even in the afternoon of her best days , made prize and purchase of his wanton eye , seduced the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathed bigamy .
refuse not , mighty lord , this proffered love .
o , make them joyful .
grant their lawful suit .
alas , why would you heap this care on me ?
i am unfit for state and majesty .
i do beseech you , take it not amiss ; i can not , nor i will not , yield to you .
zounds , i ’ ll entreat no more .
o , do not swear , my lord of propn !
if you deny them , all the land will rue it .
will you enforce me to a world of cares ?
call them again .
i am not made of stones , but penetrable to your kind entreaties , propn against my conscience and my soul .
propn bless your grace !
we see it and will say it .
in saying so , you shall but say the truth .
then i salute you with this royal title : long live propn , propn ’ s worthy king !
amen .
tomorrow will it please you to be crowned ?
even when you please , since you will have it so .
who meets us here ?
my niece propn propn in the hand of her kind aunt of propn ?
now , for my life , she ’ s wandering to the propn , on pure heart ’ s love , to greet the tender prince.— propn , well met .
whither away ?
no farther than the propn , and , as i guess , upon the like devotion as yourselves , to gratulate the gentle princes there .
kind sister , thanks .
we ’ ll enter all together .
and in good time here the lieutenant comes.— propn propn , pray you , by your leave , how doth the prince and my young son of propn ?
right well , dear madam .
by your patience , i may not suffer you to visit them .
the king hath strictly charged the contrary .
the king ?
who ’ s that ?
i mean , the propn propn .
the propn protect him from that kingly title !
propn he set bounds between their love and me ?
i am their mother .
who shall bar me from them ?
i am their father ’ s mother .
i will see them .
their aunt i am in law , in love their mother .
then bring me to their sights .
i ’ ll bear thy blame and take thy office from thee , on my peril .
no , madam , no .
i may not leave it so .
i am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
let me but meet you ladies one hour hence , and i ’ ll salute your propn of propn as mother and reverend looker - on , of two fair queens .
ah , cut my lace asunder , that my pent heart may have some scope to beat , or else i swoon with this dead - killing news !
o , unpleasing news !
propn mother ’ s name is ominous to children .
you shall have letters from me to my son in your behalf , to meet you on the way .
be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay .
o ill - dispersing wind of misery !
and i in all unwillingness will go .
o , would to propn that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were red - hot steel to sear me to the brains !
to feed my humor , wish thyself no harm .
no ?
why ?
poor heart , adieu .
i pity thy complaining .
no more than from my soul i mourn for yours .
propn , thou woeful welcomer of glory .
rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow for tender princes , use my babies well .
so foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell .
propn , you know no rules of charity , which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .
villain , thou know ’ st not law of propn nor man .
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .
but i know none , and therefore am no beast .
more wonderful , when angels are so angry .
propn , divine perfection of a woman , of these supposèd crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself .
propn , defused infection of a man , of these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursèd self .
fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself .
fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself .
by such despair i should accuse myself .
my gracious sovereign .
give me thy hand .
thus high , by thy advice and thy assistance is propn propn seated .
but shall we wear these glories for a day , or shall they last and we rejoice in them ?
still live they , and forever let them last .
ah , propn , now do i play the touch , to try if thou be current gold indeed .
propn propn lives ; think now what i would speak .
say on , my loving lord .
ha !
propn so — but propn lives .
true , noble prince .
o bitter consequence that propn still should live “ true noble prince ” !
propn , thou wast not wo nt to be so dull .
shall i be plain ?
what sayest thou now ?
your grace may do your pleasure .
propn , tut , thou art all ice ; thy kindness freezes .
say , have i thy consent that they shall die ?
give me some little breath , some pause , dear lord , before i positively speak in this .
i will resolve you herein presently .
and unrespective boys .
propn thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death ?
what is his name ?
his name , my lord , is propn .
i partly know the man .
go , call him hither , boy no more shall be the neighbor to my counsels propn he so long held out with me , untired , and stops he now for breath ?
well , be it so .
how now , propn propn , what ’ s the news ?
know , my long lord , the marquess propn , as i hear , is fled to propn , in the parts where he abides .
come hither , propn .
propn it abroad that propn my wife is very grievous sick .
inquire me out some mean poor gentleman , whom i will marry straight to propn ' daughter .
look how thou dream ’ st !
i say again , give out that propn my queen is sick and like to die .
is thy name propn ?
propn propn , and your most obedient subject .
art thou indeed ?
dar ’ st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine ?
why then , thou hast it .
two deep enemies , foes to my rest , and my sweet sleep ’ s disturbers , are they that i would have thee deal upon .
tyrrel , i mean those bastards in the propn .
let me have open means to come to them , and soon i ’ ll rid you from the fear of them .
thou sing ’ st sweet music .
propn , come hither , propn .
go , by this token .
rise , and lend thine ear .
there is no more but so .
say it is done , and i will love thee and prefer thee for it .
i will dispatch it straight .
my lord , i have considered in my mind the late request that you did sound me in .
well , let that rest .
propn is fled to propn .
i hear the news , my lord .
propn , he is your wife ’ s son .
well , look unto it .
my lord , i claim the gift , my due by promise , for which your honor and your faith is pawned— propn ' earldom of propn and the movables which you promisèd i shall possess .
propn , look to your wife .
if she convey letters to propn , you shall answer it .
what says your highness to my just request ?
i do remember me , propn the propn did prophesy that propn should be king , when propn was a little peevish boy .
a king , perhaps— my lord— how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me , i being by , that i should kill him ?
my lord , your promise for the earldom— propn !
when last i was at propn , the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it propn , at which name i started , because a bard of propn told me once i should not live long after i saw propn .
my propn ay , what ’ s o'clock ?
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me .
well , but what ’ s o'clock ?
upon the stroke of ten .
well , let it strike .
why let it strike ?
because that , like a jack , thou keep ’ st the stroke propn thy begging and my meditation .
i am not in the giving vein today .
why then , resolve me whether you will or no .
thou troublest me ; i am not in the vein .
and is it thus ?
repays he my deep service with such deep contempt ?
made i him king for this ?
o , let me think on propn and be gone to propn , while my fearful head is on !
the tyrannous and bloody act is done , the most arch deed of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of .
propn and propn , whom i did suborn to do this piece of ruthless butchery , propn they were fleshed villains , bloody dogs , melted with tenderness and mild compassion , wept like two children in their deaths ' sad story .
their lips were four red roses on a stalk , and in their summer beauty kissed each other .
propn propn , am i happy in thy news ?
if to have done the thing you gave in charge propn your happiness , be happy then , for it is done .
but propn thou see them dead ?
i did , my lord .
and buried , gentle propn ?
the chaplain of the propn hath buried them , but where , to say the truth , i do not know .
come to me , propn , soon at after - supper , when thou shalt tell the process of their death .
meantime , but think how i may do thee good , and be inheritor of thy desire .
farewell till then .
i humbly take my leave .
the son of propn have i pent up close , his daughter meanly have i matched in marriage , the sons of propn sleep in propn ’ s bosom , and propn my wife hath bid this world goodnight .
now , for i know the propn propn aims at young propn , my brother ’ s daughter , and by that knot looks proudly on the crown , to her go i , a jolly thriving wooer .
my lord !
good or bad news , that thou propn in so bluntly ?
bad news , my lord .
propn is fled to propn , and propn , backed with the hardy propn , is in the field , and still his power increaseth .
propn with propn troubles me more near than propn and his rash - levied strength .
say that i slew them not .
then say they were not slain .
but dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee .
i did not kill your husband .
why then , he is alive .
in thy foul throat thou liest .
propn propn saw propn murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood , the which thou once didst bend against her breast , but that thy brothers beat aside the point .
i was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue , that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .
thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind , that never dream ’ st on aught but butcheries .
propn thou not kill this king ?
i grant you .
dost grant me , hedgehog ?
then , propn grant me too propn mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed .
o , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
the better for the propn of propn that hath him .
he is in propn , where thou shalt never come .
let him thank me , that holp to send him thither , for he was fitter for that place than earth .
here in these confines slyly have i lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies .
a dire induction am i witness to , and will to propn , hoping the consequence will prove as bitter , black , and tragical .
withdraw thee , wretched propn .
who comes here ?
ah , my poor princes !
ah , my tender babes , my unblown flowers , new - appearing sweets , if yet your gentle souls fly in the air and be not fixed in doom perpetual , propn about me with your airy wings and hear your mother ’ s lamentation .
propn about her ; say that right for right propn dimmed your infant morn to agèd night .
so many miseries have crazed my voice that my woe - wearied tongue is still and mute .
propn propn , why art thou dead ?
wilt thou , o propn , fly from such gentle lambs and throw them in the entrails of the wolf ?
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ?
give mine the benefit of seigniory , and let my griefs frown on the upper hand .
i had a propn too , and thou did ’ st kill him ; i had a propn too ; thou holp ’ st to kill him .
o upright , just , and true - disposing propn , how do i thank thee that this carnal cur propn on the issue of his mother ’ s body and makes her pew - fellow with others ' moan !
o propn ’ s wife , triumph not in my woes !
propn witness with me , i have wept for thine .
propn propn he is dead , that killed my propn , propn other propn dead , to quit my propn ; propn propn , he is but boot , because both they matched not the high perfection of my loss .
propn propn he is dead that stabbed my propn , and the beholders of this frantic play , propn ' adulterate propn , propn , propn , propn , untimely smothered in their dusky graves .
propn yet lives , hell ’ s black intelligencer , only reserved their factor to buy souls and send them thither .
cancel his bond of life , dear propn i pray , that i may live to say , “ the dog is dead . ”
o , thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me curse that bottled spider , that foul bunch - backed toad !
i called thee then “ vain flourish of my fortune . ” i called thee then poor shadow , “ painted queen , ” the presentation of but what i was , the flattering index of a direful pageant , one heaved a - high , to be hurled down below , a mother only mocked with two fair babes , a dream of what thou wast , a garish flag to be the aim of every dangerous shot , a sign of dignity , a breath , a bubble , a queen in jest , only to fill the scene .
where is thy husband now ?
where be thy brothers ?
where are thy two sons ?
thus hath the course of justice whirled about and left thee but a very prey to time , having no more but thought of what thou wast to torture thee the more , being what thou art .
thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not propn the just proportion of my sorrow ?
these english woes will make me smile in propn .
o , thou well - skilled in curses , stay awhile , and teach me how to curse mine enemies .
forbear to sleep the nights , and fast the days ; compare dead happiness with living woe ; think that thy babes were sweeter than they were , and he that slew them fouler than he is .
bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse .
revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
my words are dull .
o , quicken them with thine !
thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine .
why should calamity be full of words ?
if so , then be not tongue - tied .
go with me , and in the breath of bitter words let ’ s smother my damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered .
who intercepts my expedition ?
o , she that might have intercepted thee , by strangling thee in her accursèd womb , from all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done .
propn thou that forehead with a golden crown where should be branded , if that right were right , the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown and the dire death of my poor sons and brothers ?
tell me , thou villain - slave , where are my children ?
where is gentle propn , propn , propn ?
where is kind propn ?
strike alarum , drums !
let not the heavens hear these telltale women propn on the propn propn anointed .
strike , i say !
either be patient and entreat me fair , or with the clamorous report of war thus will i drown your exclamations .
art thou my son ?
ay , i thank propn , my father , and yourself .
then patiently hear my impatience .
propn , i have a touch of your condition , which can not brook the accent of reproof .
o , let me speak !
do then , but i ’ ll not hear .
i will be mild and gentle in my words .
and brief , good mother , for i am in haste .
art thou so hasty ?
i have stayed for thee , propn knows , in torment and in agony .
and came i not at last to comfort you ?
what comfortable hour canst thou name , that ever graced me in thy company ?
faith , none but propn propn , that called your grace to breakfast once , forth of my company .
i prithee , hear me speak .
you speak too bitterly .
hear me a word , for i shall never speak to thee again .
so .
though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse propn in me .
i say amen to her .
stay , madam .
i must talk a word with you .
i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter .
you have a daughter called propn , virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
and must she die for this ?
o , let her live , and i ’ ll corrupt her manners , stain her beauty , propn myself as false to propn ’ s bed , throw over her the veil of infamy .
so she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter , i will confess she was not propn ’ s daughter .
wrong not her birth .
she is a royal princess .
to save her life , i ’ ll say she is not so .
and only in that safety died her brothers .
no , to their lives ill friends were contrary .
my babes were destined to a fairer death if grace had blessed thee with a fairer life .
whose hand soever launched their tender hearts , propn head , all indirectly , gave direction .
no doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stone - hard heart , to revel in the entrails of my lambs .
but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes , and i , in such a desp'rate bay of death , like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft , propn all to pieces on thy rocky bosom .
propn , so thrive i in my enterprise and dangerous success of bloody wars as i intend more good to you and yours than ever you or yours were by me harmed !
what good is covered with the face of propn , to be discovered , that can do me good ?
the advancement of your children , gentle lady .
up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads .
unto the dignity and height of fortune , the high imperial type of this earth ’ s glory .
and thou unfit for any place but hell .
yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
some dungeon .
your bedchamber .
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest !
so will it , madam till i lie with you .
be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
then know that from my soul i love thy daughter .
my daughter ’ s mother thinks it with her soul .
what do you think ?
that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul .
be not so hasty to confound my meaning .
even he that makes her queen .
who else should be ?
what , thou ?
how think you of it ?
how canst thou woo her ?
propn , with all my heart .
you mock me , madam .
this is not the way to win your daughter .
there is no other way , unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be propn , that hath done all this .
say that i did all this for love of her .
nay , then indeed she can not choose but hate thee , having bought love with such a bloody spoil .
look what is done can not be now amended .
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , which after - hours give leisure to repent .
if i did take the kingdom from your sons , to make amends i ’ ll give it to your daughter .
if i have killed the issue of your womb , to quicken your increase i will beget propn issue of your blood upon your daughter .
a grandam ’ s name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother .
your children were vexation to your youth , but mine shall be a comfort to your age .
i can not make you what amends i would ; therefore accept such kindness as i can .
what , we have many goodly days to see !
go then , my mother ; to thy daughter go .
what were i best to say ?
her father ’ s brother would be her lord ?
or shall i say her uncle ?
or he that slew her brothers and her uncles ?
under what title shall i woo for thee , that propn , the law , my honor and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years ?
infer fair propn ’ s peace by this alliance .
which she shall purchase with still - lasting war .
tell her the king , that may command , entreats— that , at her hands , which the king ’ s propn forbids .
say she shall be a high and mighty queen .
to vail the title , as her mother doth .
say i will love her everlastingly .
but how long shall that title “ ever ” last ?
sweetly in force unto her fair life ’ s end .
but how long fairly shall her sweet life last ?
as long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
as long as hell and propn likes of it .
say i , her sovereign , am her subject low .
but she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
be eloquent in my behalf to her .
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told .
then plainly to her tell my loving tale .
plain and not honest is too harsh a style .
your reasons are too shallow and too quick .
o no , my reasons are too deep and dead— too deep and dead , poor infants , in their graves .
harp not on that string , madam ; that is past .
harp on it still shall i till heart - strings break .
now by my propn , my propn , and my crown— profaned , dishonored , and the third usurped .
i swear— by nothing , for this is no oath .
then , by myself— thyself is self - misused .
now , by the world— ' propn full of thy foul wrongs .
my father ’ s death— propn life hath it dishonored .
if thou hadst feared to break an oath by propn , propn ' imperial metal circling now thy head had graced the tender temples of my child , and both the princes had been breathing here , which now , two tender bedfellows for dust , propn broken faith hath made the prey for worms .
what canst thou swear by now ?
the time to come .
the children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered , ungoverned youth , to wail it in their age ; the parents live whose children thou hast butchered , old barren plants , to wail it with their age .
swear not by time to come , for that thou hast propn ere used , by times ill - used o'erpast .
as i intend to prosper and repent , so thrive i in my dangerous affairs of hostile arms !
myself myself confound , propn and fortune bar me happy hours , propn , yield me not thy light , nor night thy rest , be opposite all planets of good luck to my proceedings if , with dear heart ’ s love , propn devotion , holy thoughts , i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter .
in her consists my happiness and thine .
urge the necessity and state of times , and be not peevish found in great designs .
shall i be tempted of the devil thus ?
ay , if the devil tempt you to do good .
ay , if your self ’ s remembrance wrong yourself .
yet thou didst kill my children .
but in your daughter ’ s womb i bury them , where , in that nest of spicery , they will breed selves of themselves , to your recomforture .
shall i go win my daughter to thy will ?
and be a happy mother by the deed .
i go .
write to me very shortly , and you shall understand from me her mind .
to our shores throng many doubtful hollow - hearted friends , unarmed and unresolved to beat them back .
propn thought that propn is their admiral ; and there they hull , expecting but the aid of propn to welcome them ashore .
some light - foot friend post to the duke of propn propn , thyself , or propn .
propn , fly to the duke .
i will , my lord , with all convenient haste .
propn , come hither .
post to propn .
o true , good propn .
bid him levy straight the greatest strength and power that he can make and meet me suddenly at propn .
i go .
what , may it please you , shall i do at propn ?
why , what wouldst thou do there before i go ?
your propn told me i should post before .
my mind is changed .
propn , what news with you ?
none good , my liege , to please you with the hearing , nor none so bad but well may be reported .
propn , a riddle !
neither good nor bad .
what propn thou run so many mile about when thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way ?
once more , what news ?
propn is on the seas .
there let him sink , and be the seas on him !
white - livered runagate , what doth he there ?
well , as you guess ?
stirred up by propn , propn , and propn , he makes for propn , here to claim the crown .
it is my day , my life .
black night o'ershade thy day , and death thy life .
curse not thyself , fair creature ; thou art both .
i would i were , to be revenged on thee .
his better doth not breathe upon the earth .
is the chair empty ?
is the sword unswayed ?
is the king dead , the empire unpossessed ?
what heir of propn is there alive but we ?
and who is propn ’ s king but great propn ’ s heir ?
then tell me , what makes he upon the seas ?
where is thy power , then , to beat him back ?
where be thy tenants and thy followers ?
are they not now upon the western shore , propn - conducting the rebels from their ships ?
cold friends to me .
what do they in the north when they should serve their sovereign in the west ?
they have not been commanded , mighty king .
propn your propn to give me leave , i ’ ll muster up my friends and meet your grace where and what time your propn shall please .
most mighty sovereign , you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful .
i never was nor never will be false .
go then and muster men , but leave behind your son propn propn .
my gracious sovereign , now in propn , as i by friends am well advertisèd , propn propn propn and the haughty prelate , propn of propn , his elder brother , with many more confederates are in arms .
in propn , my liege , the propn are in arms , and every hour more competitors propn to the rebels , and their power grows strong .
my lord , the army of great propn out on you , owls !
nothing but songs of death .
but this good comfort bring i to your highness : the propn navy is dispersed by tempest .
propn on , march on , since we are up in arms , if not to fight with foreign enemies , yet to beat down these rebels here at home .
while we reason here , a royal battle might be won and lost .
someone take order propn be brought to propn .
the rest march on with me .
but , tell me , where is princely propn now ?
at propn , or at propn in propn .
propn propn propn , a renownèd soldier ; propn propn propn , propn propn propn , propn , redoubted propn , propn propn propn , and propn ap propn , with a valiant crew , and many other of great name and worth ; and towards propn they do bend their power , if by the way they be not fought withal .
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of propn , and all the clouds that loured upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried .
propn - visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front ; and now , instead of mounting barbèd steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries , he capers nimbly in a lady ’ s chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute .
will not propn propn let me speak with him ?
no , my good lord .
therefore be patient .
propn and propn ’ s children , propn and propn , propn propn propn and thy fair son propn , propn , and all that have miscarrièd by underhand , corrupted , foul injustice , if that your moody , discontented souls do through the clouds behold this present hour , even for revenge mock my destruction.— this is all propn ' day , fellow , is it not ?
it is .
why , then all propn ' day is my body ’ s doomsday .
this is the day which , in propn propn ’ s time , i wished might fall on me when i was found false to his children and his wife ’ s allies .
this is the day wherein i wished to fall by the false faith of him who most i trusted .
this , this all propn ' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs .
that high all - seer which i dallied with propn turned my feignèd prayer on my head and given in earnest what i begged in jest .
thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points in their masters ' bosoms .
wrong hath but wrong , and blame the due of blame .
i doubt not but his friends will turn to us .
he hath no friends but who are friends for fear .
which in his dearest need will fly from him .
all for our vantage .
then , in propn ’ s name , march .
true hope is swift , and flies with swallow ’ s wings .
kings it makes gods , and meaner creatures kings .
my heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
my propn of propn here , most gracious liege .
propn , we must have knocks , ha , must we not ?
we must both give and take , my loving lord .
up with my tent ! —here will i lie tonight .
but where tomorrow ?
well , all ’ s one for that .
six or seven thousand is their utmost power .
why , our battalia trebles that account .
besides , the king ’ s name is a tower of strength which they upon the adverse party want .
let ’ s lack no discipline , make no delay , for , lords , tomorrow is a busy day .
my propn of propn , you , propn propn propn , and you , propn propn propn , stay with me .
the earl of propn keeps his regiment— propn propn propn , bear my goodnight to him , and by the second hour in the morning propn the earl to see me in my tent .
unless i have mista'en his colors much , which well i am assured i have not done , his regiment lies half a mile , at least , propn from the mighty power of the king .
if without peril it be possible , propn propn , make some good means to speak with him , and give him from me this most needful note .
upon my life , my lord , i ’ ll undertake it .
he lives that loves thee better than he could .
name him .
plantagenet .
why , that was he .
the selfsame name , but one of better nature .
where is he ?
here .
why dost thou spit at me ?
would it were mortal poison for thy sake .
never came poison from so sweet a place .
never hung poison on a fouler toad .
out of my sight !
thou dost infect mine eyes .
thine eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine .
would they were basilisks to strike thee dead .
good night , good propn propn .
come , gentlemen , let us consult upon tomorrow ’ s business into my tent .
the dew is raw and cold .
what is “ t o ” clock ?
it ’ s suppertime , my lord .
it ’ s nine o'clock .
i will not sup tonight .
give me some ink and paper .
what , is my beaver easier than it was ?
and all my armor laid into my tent ?
propn propn , hie thee to thy charge .
i go , my lord .
stir with the lark tomorrow , gentle propn .
i warrant you , my lord .
propn .
my lord .
my lord .
propn thou the melancholy propn propn ?
propn the earl of propn and himself , much about cockshut time , from troop to troop went through the army cheering up the soldiers .
so , i am satisfied .
set it down .
is ink and paper ready ?
it is , my lord .
propn , about the mid of night come to my tent and help to arm me .
leave me , i say .
fortune and victory sit on thy helm !
all comfort that the dark night can afford be to thy person , noble father - in - law .
tell me , how fares our loving mother ?
i , by attorney , bless thee from thy mother , who prays continually for propn ’ s good .
in brief , for so the season bids us be , prepare thy battle early in the morning , and put thy fortune to the arbitrament of bloody strokes and mortal - staring war .
i , as i may — that which i would i can not , — with best advantage will deceive the time , and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms .
but on thy side i may not be too forward , propn , being seen , thy brother , tender propn , be executed in his father ’ s sight .
propn .
the leisure and the fearful time cuts off the ceremonious vows of love and ample interchange of sweet discourse , which so - long - sundered friends should dwell upon .
propn give us leisure for these rites of love !
once more , adieu .
be valiant , and speed well .
once more , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
o thou , whose captain i account myself , look on my forces with a gracious eye .
make us thy ministers of chastisement , that we may praise thee in the victory !
to thee i do commend my watchful soul , propn i let fall the windows of mine eyes .
sleeping and waking , o , defend me still !
think upon propn , and with guilty fear let fall thy lance .
despair , and die !
propn ’ s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .
think on propn propn .
despair and die !
propn adversary ’ s wife doth pray for thee .
the last was i that felt thy tyranny .
o , in the battle think on propn , and die in terror of thy guiltiness .
dream on , dream on , of bloody deeds and death .
but cheer thy heart , and be thou not dismayed .
give me another horse !
bind up my wounds !
have mercy , propn , i did but dream .
o coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me !
what do i fear ?
myself ?
there ’ s none else by .
propn loves propn ; that is , i and i .
is there a murderer here ?
no .
yes , i am .
then fly !
what , from myself ?
propn , i love myself .
wherefore ?
for any good that i myself have done unto myself ?
o , no !
alas , i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself .
i am a villain .
fool , of thyself speak well .
fool , do not flatter .
my lord .
zounds , who is there ?
propn , my lord , ’ tis i .
the early village cock propn twice done salutation to the morn .
your friends are up and buckle on their armor .
o propn , i have dreamed a fearful dream !
what think ’ st thou , will our friends prove all true ?
no doubt , my lord .
by the apostle propn , shadows tonight have struck more terror to the soul of propn than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers propn in proof and led by shallow propn .
propn not yet near day .
come , go with me ; under our tents i ’ ll play the eavesdropper to see if any mean to shrink from me .
good morrow , propn .
cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here .
how have you slept , my lord ?
the sweetest sleep and fairest - boding dreams that ever entered in a drowsy head have i since your departure had , my lords .
methought their souls whose bodies propn murdered propn to my tent and cried on victory .
i promise you , my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream .
how far into the morning is it , lords ?
upon the stroke of four .
why , then ’ tis time to arm and give direction .
propn and our good cause fight upon our side .
the prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls , like high - reared bulwarks , stand before our faces .
propn except , those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow .
for what is he they follow ?
if you do sweat to put a tyrant down , you sleep in peace , the tyrant being slain .
if you do fight against your country ’ s foes , your country ’ s fat shall pay your pains the hire .
if you do fight in safeguard of your wives , your wives shall welcome home the conquerors .
if you do free your children from the sword , your children ’ s children quits it in your age .
then , in the name of propn and all these rights , advance your standards .
i would they were , that i might die at once , for now they kill me with a living death .
i never sued to friend , nor enemy ; my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word .
if thy revengeful heart can not forgive , propn , here i lend thee this sharp - pointed sword , which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee , i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee .
nay , do not pause ; for i did kill propn propn but ’ twas thy beauty that provokèd me .
what said propn as touching propn ?
that he was never trainèd up in arms .
he said the truth .
and what said propn then ?
he smiled and said “ the better for our purpose . ” he was in the right , and so indeed it is .
tell the clock there .
give me a calendar .
not i , my lord .
propn !
my lord .
the sun will not be seen today .
the sky doth frown and lour upon our army .
i would these dewy tears were from the ground .
not shine today ?
arm , arm , my lord .
the foe vaunts in the field .
come , bustle , bustle .
propn propn of propn , propn propn of propn , propn have the leading of this foot and horse .
they thus directed , we will follow in the main battle , whose puissance on either side shall be well wingèd with our chiefest horse .
this , and propn propn to boot — what think ’ st thou , propn ?
a good direction , warlike sovereign .
this found i on my tent this morning .
propn !
i hear their drum .
amaze the welkin with your broken staves—
what says propn propn ?
will he bring his power ?
my lord , he doth deny to come .
off with his son propn ’ s head !
my lord , the enemy is past the marsh .
after the battle let propn propn die .
upon them !
victory sits on our helms .
rescue , my lord of propn , rescue , rescue !
the king enacts more wonders than a man , daring an opposite to every danger .
his horse is slain , and all on foot he fights , seeking for propn in the throat of death .
rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost !
a horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse !
withdraw , my lord .
i ’ ll help you to a horse .
propn and your arms be praised , victorious friends !
great propn of propn , say amen to all !
but tell me , is young propn propn living ?
he is , my lord , and safe in propn town , propn , if it please you , we may now withdraw us .
propn propn of propn , propn , propn propn , propn propn propn , and propn propn propn .
and then , as we have ta'en the sacrament , we will unite the white rose and the red .
smile propn upon this fair conjunction , that long have frowned upon their enmity .
what traitor hears me and says not “ amen ? ” propn hath long been mad and scarred herself .
o , now let propn and propn , the true succeeders of each royal house , by propn ’ s fair ordinance conjoin together , and let their heirs , propn , if thy will be so .
abate the edge of traitors , gracious propn , that would reduce these bloody days again , and make poor propn weep in streams of blood !
let them not live to taste this land ’ s increase , that would with treason wound this fair land ’ s peace .
now civil wounds are stopped , peace lives again .
that she may long live here , propn say amen .
take up the sword again , or take up me .
arise , dissembler .
though i wish thy death , i will not be the executioner .
i have already .
that was in thy rage .
speak it again and , even with the word , this hand , which for thy love did kill thy love , propn for thy love kill a far truer love .
to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory .
i would i knew thy heart .
propn figured in my tongue .
i fear me both are false .
then never man was man true .
well , well , put up your sword .
say then my peace is made .
that shall you know hereafter .
but shall i live in hope ?
all men i hope live so .
propn to wear this ring .
wear both of them , for both of them are thine .
and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand , propn dost confirm his happiness forever .
what is it ?
that it would please you leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner , and presently repair to propn propn , where , after i have solemnly interred at propn propn this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears , i will with all expedient duty see you .
for divers unknown reasons , i beseech you , grant me this boon .
with all my heart , and much it joys me too to see you are become so propn propn and propn , go along with me .
bid me farewell .
sirs , take up the corse .
towards propn , noble lord ?
no , to propn .
there attend my coming .
was ever woman in this humor wooed ?
was ever woman in this humor won ?
i ’ ll have her , but i will not keep her long .
and yet to win her , all the world to nothing !
ha !
propn she forgot already that brave prince , propn , her lord , whom i some three months since propn in my angry mood at propn ?
a sweeter and a propn gentleman , framed in the prodigality of nature , young , valiant , wise , and , no doubt , right royal , the spacious world can not again afford .
and will she yet abase her eyes on me , that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed ?
on me , whose all not equals propn ’ s moiety ?
on me , that halts and am misshapen thus ?
my dukedom to a beggarly denier , i do mistake my person all this while !
upon my life , she finds , although i can not , myself to be a marv'lous proper man .
i ’ ll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body .
since i am crept in favor with myself , i will maintain it with some little cost .
but first i ’ ll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love .
shine out , fair sun , till i have bought a glass , that i may see my shadow as i pass .
have patience , madam .
there ’ s no doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustomed health .
if he were dead , what would betide on me ?
ah , he is young , and his minority is put unto the trust of propn propn , a man that loves not me nor none of you .
is it concluded that he shall be propn ?
it is determined , not concluded yet ; but so it must be if the king miscarry .
propn make your propn joyful , as you have been .
saw you the king today , my lord of propn ?
but now the duke of propn and i are come from visiting his majesty .
what likelihood of his amendment , lords ?
propn , good hope .
his grace speaks cheerfully .
propn grant him health .
did you confer with him ?
ay , madam .
would all were well — but that will never be .
they do me wrong , and i will not endure it !
who is it that complains unto the king that i , forsooth , am stern and love them not ?
can not a plain man live and think no harm , but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken , sly , insinuating jacks ?
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace ?
to thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace .
when have i injured thee ?
or any of your faction ?
a plague upon you all !
his royal grace , whom propn preserve better than you would wish , can not be quiet scarce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints .
brother of propn , you mistake the matter .
i can not tell .
the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch .
come , come , we know your meaning , brother propn .
you envy my advancement , and my friends ' .
propn grant we never may have need of you .
meantime propn grants that we have need of you .
our brother is imprisoned by your means , myself disgraced , and the nobility held in contempt , while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble .
by propn that raised me to this careful height from that contented hap which i enjoyed , i never did incense his majesty against the duke of propn , but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him .
and therefore , since i can not prove a lover to entertain these fair well - spoken days , i am determinèd to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days .
plots have i laid , inductions dangerous , by drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , to set my brother propn and the king in deadly hate , the one against the other ; and if propn propn be as true and just as i am subtle , false , and treacherous , this day should propn closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that “ g ” of propn ’ s heirs the murderer shall be .
his majesty , tend'ring my person ’ s safety , hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the propn .
upon what cause ?
because my name is propn .
propn , my lord , that fault is none of yours .
he should , for that , commit your godfathers .
o , belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be new christened in the propn .
but what ’ s the matter , propn ?
may i know ?
what may she not ?
i wis , your grandam had a worser match .
my propn of propn , i have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs .
by propn , i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts that oft i have endured .
i had rather be a country servant - maid than a great queen with this condition , to be so baited , scorned , and stormèd at .
small joy have i in being propn ’ s queen .
so should we you , if you should be our king .
if i should be ?
i had rather be a peddler .
hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out in sharing that which you have pilled from me !
which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
propn , wrinkled witch , what propn thou in my sight ?
but repetition of what thou hast marred .
that will i make before i let thee go .
propn thou not banishèd on pain of death ?
i was , but i do find more pain in banishment than death can yield me here by my abode .
the sorrow that i have by right is yours , and all the pleasures you usurp are mine .
o , ’ twas the foulest deed to slay that babe , and the most merciless that e'er was heard of !
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
what , were you snarling all before i came , ready to catch each other by the throat , and turn you all your hatred now on me ?
thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , outlive thy glory , like my wretched self .
have done thy charm , thou hateful , withered hag .
and leave out thee ?
stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me .
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul .
propn !
ha ?
i call thee not .
i cry thee mercy , then , for i did think that thou hadst called me all these bitter names .
why , so i did , but looked for no reply .
o , let me make the period to my curse !
propn done by me , and ends in “ propn . ” thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
poor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune , why strew ’ st thou sugar on that bottled spider , whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ?
the day will come that thou shalt wish for me to help thee curse that poisonous bunch - backed toad .
false - boding woman , end thy frantic curse , propn to thy harm thou move our patience .
propn shame upon you , you have all moved mine .
were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
to serve me well , you all should do me duty : teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects .
o , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty !
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them , and if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces .
good counsel , marry .
learn it , learn it , marquess .
it touches you , my lord , as much as me .
and turns the sun to shade .
urge neither charity nor shame to me .
uncharitably with me have you dealt , and shamefully my hopes by you are butchered .
my charity is outrage , life my shame , and in that shame still live my sorrows ' rage .
have done , have done .
thy garments are not spotted with our blood , nor thou within the compass of my curse .
nor no one here , for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air .
what doth she say , my lord of propn ?
nothing that i respect , my gracious lord .
what , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel , and soothe the devil that i warn thee from ?
my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .
and so doth mine .
i muse why she ’ s at liberty .
i can not blame her .
i never did her any , to my knowledge .
yet you have all the vantage of her wrong .
marry , as for propn , he is well repaid ; he is franked up to fatting for his pains .
propn pardon them that are the cause thereof .
so do i ever propn had i cursed now , i had cursed myself .
propn , propn , when i know , for i protest as yet i do not .
but , as i can learn , he hearkens after prophecies and dreams , and from the crossrow plucks the letter and says a wizard told him that by “ g ” his issue disinherited should be .
and for my name of propn begins with it follows in his thought that i am he .
why , this it is when men are ruled by women .
propn not the king that sends you to the propn .
my propn propn his wife , propn , ’ tis she that tempers him to this extremity .
propn , his majesty doth call for you , — and for your grace , —and yours , my gracious lords .
we wait upon your grace .
i do the wrong , and first begin to brawl .
now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on propn , propn , propn ; but then i sigh and , with a piece of scripture , tell them that propn bids us do good for evil ; and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stolen out of propn propn , and seem a saint when most i play the devil .
but , soft !
are you now going to dispatch this thing ?
we are , my lord , and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is .
well thought upon .
i have it here about me .
propn , tut , my lord , we will not stand to prate .
talkers are no good doers .
be assured we go to use our hands and not our tongues .
your eyes drop millstones , when fools ' eyes drop tears .
i like you lads .
go , go , dispatch .
we will , my noble lord .
why looks your grace so heavily today ?
what was your dream , my lord ?
i pray you tell me .
methoughts that i had broken from the propn and was embarked to cross to propn , and in my company my brother propn , who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches .
thence we looked toward propn and cited up a thousand fearful times , during the wars of propn and propn that had befall'n us .
o propn , methought what pain it was to drown , what dreadful noise of waters in my ears , what sights of ugly death within my eyes .
methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wracks , a thousand men that fishes gnawed upon , propn of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , inestimable stones , unvalued jewels , all scattered in the bottom of the sea .
had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep ?
methought i had , and often did i strive to yield the ghost , but still the envious flood stopped in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty , vast , and wand'ring air , but smothered it within my panting bulk , who almost burst to belch it in the sea .
i passed , methought , the melancholy flood , with that sour ferryman which poets write of , unto the kingdom of perpetual night .
the first that there did greet my stranger - soul was my great father - in - law , renownèd propn , who spake aloud , “ what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false propn ? ” and so he vanished .
no marvel , lord , though it affrighted you .
i am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it .
ah keeper , keeper , i have done those things , that now give evidence against my soul , for propn ’ s sake , and see how he requites me.— o propn , if my deep prayers can not appease thee , but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , yet execute thy wrath in me alone !
o , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children ! — propn , i prithee sit by me awhile .
my soul is heavy , and i fain would sleep .
i will , my lord .
propn give your grace good rest .
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , makes the night morning , and the noontide night .
princes have but their titles for their glories , an outward honor for an inward toil ,
what wouldst thou , fellow ?
and how propn thou hither ?
i would speak with propn , and i came hither on my legs .
what , so brief ?
propn better , sir , to be brief than tedious .— let him see our commission , and talk no more .
i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of propn to your hands .
there lies the duke asleep , and there the keys .
you may , sir .
propn a point of wisdom .
fare you well .
what , shall i stab him as he sleeps ?
no .
he ’ ll say ’ twas done cowardly , when he wakes .
why , he shall never wake until the great propn propn .
why , then he ’ ll say we stabbed him sleeping .
the urging of that word “ judgment ” hath bred a kind of remorse in me .
what , art thou afraid ?
not to kill him , having a warrant , but to be damned for killing him , from the which no warrant can defend me .
i thought thou hadst been resolute .
so i am — to let him live .
i ’ ll back to the duke of propn and tell him so .
nay , i prithee stay a little .
i hope this passionate humor of mine will change .
it was wo nt to hold me but while one tells twenty .
how dost thou feel thyself now ?
faith , some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me .
remember our reward when the deed ’ s done .
zounds , he dies !
i had forgot the reward .
where ’ s thy conscience now ?
o , in the duke of propn ’ s purse .
so when he opens his purse to give us our reward , thy conscience flies out .
propn no matter .
let it go .
there ’ s few or none will entertain it .
what if it come to thee again ?
i ’ ll not meddle with it .
propn a blushing , shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man ’ s bosom .
i am strong - framed .
he can not prevail with me .
spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation .
come , shall we fall to work ?
take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room .
o excellent device— and make a sop of him .
strike !
no , we ’ ll reason with him .
where art thou , keeper ?
give me a cup of wine .
you shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .
in propn ’ s name , what art thou ?
a man , as you are .
but not , as i am , royal .
nor you , as we are , loyal .
thy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble .
my voice is now the king propn , my looks mine own .
your eyes do menace me .
why look you pale ?
who sent you hither ?
wherefore do you come ?
to , to , propn to murder me ?
ay , ay .
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so , and therefore can not have the hearts to do it .
wherein , my friends , have i offended you ?
offended us you have not , but the king .
i shall be reconciled to him again .
never , my lord .
therefore prepare to die .
are you drawn forth among a world of men to slay the innocent ?
what is my offense ?
where is the evidence that doth accuse me ?
what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge ?
or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor propn ' death before i be convict by course of law ?
to threaten me with death is most unlawful .
i charge you , as you hope to have redemption , by propn ’ s dear blood shed for our grievous sins , that you depart , and lay no hands on me .
what we will do , we do upon command .
even so .
an please your worship , propn , you may partake of anything we say .
we speak no treason , man .
we say the king is wise and virtuous , and his noble queen well struck in years , fair , and not jealous .
we say that propn ’ s wife hath a pretty foot , a cherry lip , a bonny eye , a passing pleasing tongue , and that the queen ’ s kindred are made gentlefolks .
how say you , sir ?
can you deny all this ?
with this , my lord , myself have naught to do .
her husband , knave .
propn thou betray me ?
i do beseech your grace to pardon me , and withal propn your conference with the noble duke .
and he that hath commanded is our king .
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too .
whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend .
how canst thou urge propn ’ s dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in such dear degree ?
for whose sake did i that ill deed ?
for propn , for my brother , for his sake .
if propn will be avengèd for this deed , o , know you yet he doth it publicly !
take not the quarrel from his powerful arm ; he needs no indirect or lawless course to cut off those that have offended him .
my brother ’ s love , the devil , and my rage .
i am his brother , and i love him well .
you are deceived .
your brother propn hates you .
o , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear .
go you to him from me .
ay , so we will .
tell him , when that our princely father propn blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , he little thought of this divided friendship .
propn propn think of this , and he will weep .
ay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep .
right , as snow in harvest .
come , you deceive yourself .
propn he that sends us to destroy you here .
why , so he doth , when he delivers you from this earth ’ s thralldom to the joys of propn .
make peace with propn , for you must die , my lord .
have you that holy feeling in your souls to counsel me to make my peace with propn , and art you yet to your own souls so blind that thou will war with propn by murd'ring me ?
o sirs , consider : they that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed .
propn , and save your souls .
which of you — if you were a prince ’ s son being pent from liberty , as i am now— if two such murderers as yourselves came to you , would not entreat for life ?
ay , you would beg , were you in my distress .
propn ?
no .
propn cowardly and womanish .
look behind you , my lord .
take that , and that .
how now ?
what mean ’ st thou , that thou propn me not ?
by heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been .
i would he knew that i had saved his brother .
so do not i .
go , coward as thou art .
well , i ’ ll go hide the body in some hole till that the duke give order for his burial .
and when i have my meed , i will away , for this will out , and then i must not stay .
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
then plainly know my heart ’ s dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich propn .
as mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , and all combined , save what thou must combine by holy marriage .
when and where and how we met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , i ’ ll tell thee as we pass , but this i pray : that thou consent to marry us today .
propn propn propn , what a change is here !
is propn , whom thou didst love so dear , so soon forsaken ?
young men ’ s love then lies not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
the sun not yet thy sighs from propn clears , propn old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
propn , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washed off yet .
if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , propn and these woes were all for propn .
and art thou changed ?
pronounce this sentence then : women may fall when there ’ s no strength in men .
thou chid ’ st me oft for loving propn .
for doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
and badest me bury love .
not in a grave , to lay one in , another out to have .
i pray thee , chide not .
the other did not so .
oh , she knew well propn love did read by rote , that could not spell .
but come , young waverer , come , go with me , in one respect i ’ ll thy assistant be , for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households ' rancor to pure love .
oh , let us hence .
i stand on sudden haste .
wisely and slow .
they stumble that run fast .
where the devil should this propn be ?
came he not home tonight ?
not to his father propn .
i spoke with his man .
why , that same pale hard - hearted wench , that propn , propn him so , that he will sure run mad .
propn , the kinsman to old propn , propn sent a letter to his father ’ s house .
a challenge , on my life .
propn will answer it .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
nay , he will answer the letter ’ s master , how he dares , being dared .
alas , poor propn !
and is he a man to encounter tybalt ?
why , what is propn ?
the what ?
without his roe , like a dried herring .
o flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
now is he for the numbers that propn flowed in .
good morrow to you both .
what counterfeit did i give you ?
the slip , sir , the slip .
can you not conceive ?
nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
i serve as good a man as you .
no better .
well , sir .
you lie .
you know not what you do .
what , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
come between us , good propn .
my wits faints .
switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or i ’ ll cry a match .
nay , if our wits run the wild - goose chase , i am done , for thou hast more of the wild - goose in one of thy wits than , i am sure , i have in my whole five .
was i with you there for the goose ?
thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
nay , good goose , bite not .
propn wit is a very bitter sweeting .
it is a most sharp sauce .
and is it not well served into a sweet goose ?
oh , here ’ s a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
i stretch it out for that word “ broad , ” which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
now art thou sociable .
now art thou propn .
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
oh , thou art deceived .
i would have made it short , for i was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .
here ’ s goodly gear .
two , two — a shirt and a smock .
propn !
propn !
my fan , propn .
propn ye good morrow , gentlemen .
propn ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .
is it good e'en ?
propn no less , i tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
out upon you !
what a man are you ?
one , gentlewoman , that propn hath made , himself to mar .
by my troth , it is well said .
for himself to mar , ” quoth he ?
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young propn ?
i can tell you , but young propn will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
you say well .
yea , is the worst well ?
very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
she will indite him to some supper .
so ho !
what hast thou found ?
propn , will you come to your father propn ?
we ’ ll to dinner , thither .
i will follow you .
a gentleman , propn , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
an he speak any thing against me , i ’ ll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such jacks .
and if i can not , i ’ ll find those that shall .
scurvy knave !
i am none of his flirt - gills .
i am none of his skains - mates .
i saw no man use you at his pleasure .
if i had , my weapon should quickly have been out , i warrant you .
i dare draw as soon as another man if i see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .
now , afore propn , i am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
scurvy knave !
nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
i protest unto thee— good heart , and i ' faith , i will tell her as much .
propn , propn , she will be a joyful woman .
what wilt thou tell her , nurse ?
thou dost not mark me .
and there she shall at propn propn ' cell be shrived and married .
and stay , good nurse .
behind the abbey wall within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , which to the high top - gallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night .
propn .
be trusty , and i ’ ll quit thy pains .
propn .
commend me to thy mistress .
now propn in propn bless thee !
propn you , sir .
what sayst thou , my dear nurse ?
is your man secret ?
did you ne'er hear say , “ two may keep counsel , putting one away ” ?
propn thee , my man ’ s as true as steel .
well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .— propn , propn !
when ’ twas a little prating thing .— oh , there is a nobleman in town , one propn , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
i anger her sometimes and tell her that propn is the properer man .
but , i ’ ll warrant you , when i say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .
doth not propn , propn , what of that ?
both with an ah , mocker , that ’ s the dog ’ s name .
commend me to thy lady .
ay , a thousand times .— propn !
propn !
before and apace .
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse .
perchance she can not meet him .
that ’ s not so .
oh , she is lame !
love ’ s heralds should be thoughts , which ten times faster glide than the sun ’ s beams , driving back shadows over louring hills .
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day ’ s journey , and from nine till twelve is three long hours , yet she is not come .
had she affections and warm youthful blood , she would be as swift in motion as a ball .
my words would bandy her to my sweet love , and his to me .
but old folks , many feign as they were dead , propn , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
o propn , she comes .— o honey nurse , what news ?
propn thou met with him ?
send thy man away .
propn , stay at the gate .
now , good sweet propn propn propn , why look ’ st thou sad ?
though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .
if good , thou shamest the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face .
i am aweary .
give me leave awhile .
propn , how my bones ache !
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news .
can you not stay awhile ?
do you not see that i am out of breath ?
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ?
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
is thy news good , or bad ?
answer to that .
say either , and i ’ ll stay the circumstance .
let me be satisfied .
is ’ t good or bad ?
well , you have made a simple choice .
you know not how to choose a man .
propn !
no , not he , though his face be better than any man propn , yet his leg excels all men ’ s , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .
he is not the flower of courtesy , but , i ’ ll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .
go thy ways , wench .
serve propn .
what , have you dined at home ?
no , no .
but all this did i know before .
what says he of our marriage ?
what of that ?
my back a ' t ' other side .
ah , my back , my back !
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well .
sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , i warrant , a virtuous— where is your mother ?
where is my mother ?
why , she is within .
where should she be ?
how oddly thou repliest !
your love says , like an honest gentleman , ' where is your mother ?
o propn ’ s lady dear , are you so hot ?
marry , come up , i trow .
is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
propn do your messages yourself .
here ’ s such a coil .
come , what says propn ?
have you got leave to go to shrift today ?
i have .
then hie you hence to propn propn ’ s cell .
there stays a husband to make you a wife .
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .
they ’ ll be in scarlet straight at any news .
hie you to church .
i must another way to fetch a ladder , by the which your love must climb a bird ’ s nest soon when it is dark .
go .
i ’ ll to dinner .
hie you to the cell .
i do but keep the peace .
put up thy sword , or manage it to part these men with me .
what , drawn , and talk of peace ?
i hate the word , as i hate hell , all montagues , and thee .
have at thee , coward !
clubs , bills , and partisans !
strike !
beat them down !
down with the capulets !
down with the montagues !
what noise is this ?
my sword , i say !
propn propn is come , and flourishes his blade in spite of me .
thou villain propn !
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
hie to high fortune !
propn nurse , farewell .
amen , amen .
but come what sorrow can , it can not countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight .
therefore love moderately .
long love doth so .
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
here comes the lady .
oh , so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
good even to my ghostly confessor .
propn shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
as much to him , else is his thanks too much .
ah , propn , if the measure of thy joy be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more to blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath this neighbor air , and let rich music ’ s tongue propn the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter .
conceit , more rich in matter than in words , brags of his substance , not of ornament .
come , come with me , and we will make short work .
i pray thee , good propn , let ’ s retire .
thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says “ propn send me no need of thee ! ” and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .
am i like such a fellow ?
come , come , thou art as hot a propn in thy mood as any in propn , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
and what to ?
nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .
what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?
thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .
thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
propn thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before propn ?
with another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
the fee simple ?
o simple !
by my head , here comes the capulets .
by my heel , i care not .
couple it with something .
make it a word and a blow .
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
could you not take some occasion without giving ?
propn , thou consort ’ st with propn .
what , dost thou make us minstrels ?
an thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
we talk here in the public haunt of men .
either withdraw unto some private place , and reason coldly of your grievances , or else depart .
here all eyes gaze on us .
men ’ s eyes were made to look and let them gaze .
i will not budge for no man ’ s pleasure , i .
well , peace be with you , sir .
here comes my man .
but i ’ ll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .
propn , the reason that i have to love thee propn much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting .
villain am i none .
therefore , farewell .
i see thou know ’ st me not .
boy , this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me .
therefore turn and draw .
and so , good propn — which name i tender as dearly as my own — be satisfied .
o calm dishonourable , vile submission !
what wouldst thou have with me ?
will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?
make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
i am for you .
propn propn , put thy rapier up .
away , propn .
i am hurt .
a plague o ' both your houses !
i am sped .
is he gone and hath nothing ?
what , art thou hurt ?
propn , ’ tis enough .
where is my page ? — go , villain , fetch a surgeon .
courage , man .
the hurt can not be much .
no , ’ tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church - door , but ’ tis enough , ’ twill serve .
ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
i am peppered , i warrant , for this world .
a plague o ' both your houses !
zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !
a braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
why the devil came you between us ?
i was hurt under your arm .
i thought all for the best .
help me into some house , propn , or i shall faint .
a plague o ' both your houses !
they have made worms ' meat of me .
i have it , and soundly too .
your houses !
o propn , propn , brave propn is dead !
here comes the furious propn back again .
alive in triumph — and propn slain !
either thou or i , or both , must go with him .
thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here propn with him hence .
this shall determine that .
propn , away , be gone !
the citizens are up , and propn slain .
stand not amazed .
the propn will doom thee death if thou art taken .
hence , be gone , away !
why dost thou stay ?
which way ran he that killed propn ?
propn , that murderer , which way ran he ?
there lies that propn .
speak , nephew .
were you by when it began ?
where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
o noble prince , i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .
there lies the man , slain by young propn , that slew thy kinsman , brave propn .
propn , my cousin !
o my brother ’ s child !
o cousin , cousin !
propn , who began this bloody fray ?
propn , he cries aloud , “ hold , friends !
friends , part ! ” and , swifter than his tongue , his agile arm beats down their fatal points , and ’ twixt them rushes — underneath whose arm an envious thrust from propn hit the life of stout propn , and then propn fled .
but by and by comes back to propn , who had but newly entertained revenge , and to propn they go like lightning , for ere i could draw to part them was stout propn slain .
and , as he fell , did propn turn and fly .
this is the truth , or let propn die .
he speaks not true .
some twenty of them fought in this black strife , and all those twenty could but kill one life .
i beg for justice , which thou , propn , must give .
propn slew propn .
propn must not live .
propn slew him ; he slew propn .
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
his fault concludes but what the law should end , the life of propn .
i have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .
but i ’ ll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine .
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses .
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , therefore use none .
propn hence this body and attend our will .
mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties , or , if love be blind , it best agrees with night .
come , civil night , thou sober - suited matron , all in black , and learn me how to lose a winning match propn for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .
hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , with thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , think true love acted simple modesty .
come , night .
come , propn .
come , thou day in night , for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night propn than new snow upon a raven ’ s back .
and when i shall die , take him and cut him out in little stars , and he will make the face of propn so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun .
the cords that propn bid thee fetch ?
ay , ay , the cords .
ay me , what news ?
why dost thou wring thy hands ?
ah , welladay !
we are undone , lady , we are undone !
alack the day !
can propn be so envious ?
propn can , though propn can not .
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
this torture should be roared in dismal hell .
propn propn slain himself ?
say thou but “ ay , ” and that bare vowel than the death - darting eye of cockatrice .
i am not i if there be such an or those eyes shut that makes thee answer “ ay . ” if he be slain , say “ ay , ” or if not , “ no . ” brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
to prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .
propn earth , to earth resign .
o propn , propn , the best friend i had !
that ever i should live to see thee dead .
is propn slaughtered , and is tybalt dead ?
my dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?
propn is gone , and propn banishèd .
o propn , did propn ’ s hand shed propn ’ s blood ?
it did , it did .
propn the day , it did .
o serpent heart hid with a flowering face !
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
propn - feathered raven , wolvish - ravening lamb !
o nature , what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound ?
ah , where ’ s my man ? — give me some aqua vitae.— these griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
shame come to propn !
blistered be thy tongue for such a wish !
he was not born to shame .
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , for ’ tis a throne where honor may be crowned .
sole monarch of the universal earth , oh , what a beast was i to chide at him !
will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?
but wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
that villain cousin would have killed my husband .
all this is comfort .
wherefore weep i then ?
i would forget it fain , but oh , it presses to my memory , like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .
tybalt is dead , and propn banishèd . ”
that “ banishèd , ” that one word “ banishèd ” propn slain ten thousand tybalts .
propn ’ s death was woe enough , if it had ended there .
or , if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be ranked with other griefs , why followed not , when she said “ propn propn dead , ” “ propn father ” or “ thy mother , ” nay , or both , which modern lamentations might have moved ?
but with a rearward following propn ’ s death , “ propn is banishèd . ” to speak that word , is father , mother , propn , propn , propn , all slain , all dead .
propn is banishèd . ” there is no end , no limit , measure , bound , in that word ’ s death .
no words can that woe sound .
where is my father and my mother , propn ?
weeping and wailing over propn ’ s corse .
will you go to them ?
i will bring you thither .
wash they his wounds with tears ?
mine shall be spent when theirs are dry , for propn ’ s banishment .
take up those cords .— poor ropes , you are beguiled , both you and i , for propn is exiled .
he made you for a highway to my bed , but i , a maid , die maiden - widowèd .
and death , not propn , take my maidenhead !
hie to your chamber .
i ’ ll find propn to comfort you .
i wot well where he is .
propn propn , your propn will be here at night .
i ’ ll to him .
he is hid at propn ' cell .
propn , come forth .
come forth , thou fearful man .
propn , what news ?
too familiar is my dear son with such sour company .
i bring thee tidings of the propn ’ s doom .
what less than doomsday is the propn ’ s doom ?
ha , banishment !
be merciful , say “ death , ” for exile hath more terror in his look , much more than death .
do not say “ banishment . ” hence from propn art thou banishèd .
be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
there is no world without propn walls but purgatory , torture , hell itself .
hence “ banishèd ” is banished from the world , and world ’ s exile is death .
calling death “ banishment , ” thou cutt ’ st my head off with a golden ax and smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
o deadly sin !
o rude unthankfulness !
propn torture and not mercy .
more validity , more honorable state , more courtship lives in carrion flies than propn .
flies may do this , but i from this must fly .
they are free men , but i am banishèd .
and sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
propn thou no poison mixed , no sharp - ground knife , no sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , but “ banishèd ” to kill me ? — “ banishèd ” !
o propn , the damnèd use that word in hell .
howling attends it .
how hast thou the heart , being a divine , a ghostly confessor , a sin - absolver , and my friend professed , to mangle me with that word “ banishèd ” ?
thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
here were the servants of your adversary , and yours , close fighting ere i did approach .
i drew to part them .
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows , came more and more and fought on part and part , till the propn came , who parted either part .
oh , where is propn ?
saw you him today ?
right glad i am he was not at this fray .
towards him i made , but he was ' ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood .
many a morning hath he there been seen , with tears augmenting the fresh morning ’ s dew , adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .
but all so soon as the all - cheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from propn ’ s bed , away from light steals home my heavy son ,
oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
talk no more .
oh , then i see that madmen have no ears .
how should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
propn thou as young as i , propn thy love , an hour but married , propn murderèd , doting like me , and like me banishèd , then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground , as i do now , taking the measure of an unmade grave .
arise .
one knocks .
propn propn , hide thyself .
not i , unless the breath of heartsick groans , propn , infold me from the search of eyes .
who knocks so hard ?
whence come you ?
what ’ s your will ?
o propn propn , o , tell me , propn propn , where is my lady ’ s lord ?
where ’ s propn ?
oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , just in her case .
o woeful sympathy , piteous predicament !
even so lies she , propn and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
stand , an you be a man .
for propn ’ s sake , for her sake , rise and stand .
why should you fall into so deep an o ?
nurse !
ah sir , ah sir .
death propn the end of all .
propn thou of propn ?
how is it with her ?
where is she ?
and how doth she ?
and what says my concealed lady to our canceled love ?
as if that name , propn from the deadly level of a gun , did murder her , as that name ’ s cursed hand murdered her kinsman .
o , tell me , propn , tell me , in what vile part of this anatomy propn my name lodge ?
tell me , that i may sack the hateful mansion .
art thou a man ?
thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast .
thou hast amazed me .
by my holy order , i thought thy disposition better tempered .
propn thou slain propn ?
why rail ’ st thou on thy birth , the propn , and earth ?
propn , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , which , like a usurer , abound ’ st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .
what , rouse thee , man !
propn propn is alive , for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead— there art thou happy .
tybalt would kill thee , but thou slew ’ st propn — there art thou happy .
the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile — there art thou happy .
a pack of blessings light upon thy back , happiness courts thee in her best array ,
but , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , thou pout ’ st upon thy fortune and thy love .
go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .
ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .
commend me to thy lady , and bid her hasten all the house to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .
propn is coming .
o propn , i could have stayed here all the night to hear good counsel .
oh , what learning is !
do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
how well my comfort is revived by this !
go hence .
good night .
and here stands all your state : either be gone before the watch be set , or by the break of day disguised from hence .
propn in propn .
i ’ ll find out your man , and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here .
give me thy hand .
propn late .
propn .
things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , that we have had no time to move our daughter .
look you , she loved her kinsman propn dearly , and so did i .
well , we were born to die .
these times of woe afford no time to woo .
propn , good night .
commend me to your daughter .
i will , and know her mind early tomorrow .
tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
propn propn , i will make a desperate tender of my child ’ s love .
acquaint her here of my son propn ' love , and bid her , mark you me , on propn next— but , soft !
what day is this ?
propn , my lord .
propn !
ha , ha .
do you like this haste ?
we ’ ll keep no great ado , a friend or two .
for , hark you , propn being slain so late , it may be thought we held him carelessly , being our kinsman , if we revel much .
therefore we ’ ll have some half a dozen friends , and there an end .
but what say you to propn ?
my lord , i would that propn were tomorrow .
well get you gone .
o ' propn be it , then.— go you to propn ere you go to bed .
wilt thou be gone ?
it is not yet near day .
it was the nightingale , and not the lark , that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .
look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .
propn ’ s candles are burnt out , and jocund day propn tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
propn light is not daylight , i know it , i .
it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer , and light thee on thy way to propn .
therefore stay yet .
thou propn not to be gone .
let me be ta'en .
let me be put to death .
i am content , so thou wilt have it so .
i have more care to stay than will to go .
come , death , and welcome !
let ’ s talk .
it is not day .
it is , it is .
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , propn harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
some say the lark makes sweet division .
this doth not so , for she divideth us .
more light and light it grows .
more light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
propn .
nurse ?
your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
the day is broke .
then , window , let day in and let life out .
propn , farewell .
one kiss , and i ’ ll descend .
and private in his chamber pens himself , propn up his windows , locks fair daylight out , and makes himself an artificial night .
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
i neither know it nor can learn of him .
have you importuned him by any means ?
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift .— come , madam , let ’ s away .
art thou gone so , love , lord ?
oh , by this count i shall be much in years propn i again behold my propn .
farewell !
i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
oh , think ’ st thou we shall ever meet again ?
o propn , i have an ill - divining soul .
methinks i see thee now , thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
either my eyesight fails , or thou look ’ st pale .
and trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
dry sorrow drinks our blood .
propn , adieu !
o fortune , fortune !
all men call thee fickle .
be fickle , fortune , for then , i hope , thou wilt not keep him long , but send him back .
who is propn that calls ?
is it my lady mother ?
what unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?
why , how now , juliet ?
propn , i am not well .
propn weeping for your cousin ’ s death ?
what , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
an if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .
therefore , have done .
some grief shows much of love , but much of grief shows still some want of wit .
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
so shall you feel the loss , but not the friend which you weep for .
feeling so the loss , can not choose but ever weep the friend .
well , girl , thou propn not so much for his death , as that the villain lives which slaughtered him .
what villain , madam ?
that same villain , propn .
that is because the traitor murderer lives .
ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
would none but i might venge my cousin ’ s death !
then weep no more .
i ’ ll send to one in propn , where that same banished runagate doth live , shall give him such an unaccustomed dram that he shall soon keep propn company .
and then , i hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
indeed , i never shall be satisfied with propn , till i behold him — dead— is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .
propn , if you could find out but a man to bear a poison , i would temper it , that propn should , upon receipt thereof , soon sleep in quiet .
to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughtered him !
find thou the means , and i ’ ll find such a man .
but now i ’ ll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
and joy comes well in such a needy time .
what are they , beseech your ladyship ?
well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .
propn , in happy time , what day is that ?
marry , my child , early next propn morn , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman , the propn propn , at propn propn propn propn , shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
now , by propn propn propn propn and propn too , he shall not make me there a joyful bride .
i wonder at this haste , that i must we d propn he , that should be husband , comes to woo .
i pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , i will not marry yet .
and when i do , i swear it shall be propn , whom you know i hate , rather than propn .
these are news indeed !
here comes your father .
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
how now ?
a conduit , girl ?
what , still in tears , propn showering ?
have you delivered to her our decree ?
i would the fool were married to her grave !
how , will she none ?
is she not proud ?
doth she not count her blessed , propn as she is , that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?
not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
how , how , how , how ?
chopped logic !
what is this ?
proud , ” and “ i thank you , ” and “ i thank you not , ” and yet “ not proud ” ?
out , you green sickness , carrion !
out , you baggage !
you tallow face !
propn , fie !
what , are you mad ?
propn propn , i beseech you on my knees , hear me with patience but to speak a word .
speak not .
reply not .
do not answer me .
out on her , hilding !
propn in propn bless her !
you are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
and why , my propn propn ?
smatter with your gossips , go .
i speak no treason .
oh , propn ' i ' good e'en .
may not one speak ?
peace , you mumbling fool !
utter your gravity o'er a gossip ’ s bowl , for here we need it not .
you are too hot .
propn ’ s bread !
it makes me mad .
day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , alone , in company , still my care hath been to have her matched .
propn is near .
lay hand on heart , advise .
an you be mine , i ’ ll give you to my friend .
trust to propn , bethink you .
i ’ ll not be forsworn .
delay this marriage for a month , a week .
or , if you do not , make the bridal bed in that dim monument where propn lies .
talk not to me , for i ’ ll not speak a word .
do as thou wilt , for i have done with thee .
o god ! —o nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
my husband is on earth , my faith in propn .
how shall that faith return again to earth , unless that husband send it me from propn by leaving earth ?
comfort me .
propn thou not a word of joy ?
some comfort , propn .
oh , he ’ s a lovely gentleman .
propn propn a dishclout to him .
an eagle , madam , propn not so green , so quick , so fair an eye as propn hath .
beshrew my very heart , i think you are happy in this second match , for it excels your first .
or if it did not , your first is dead , or ’ twere as good he were , as living here and you no use of him .
speakest thou from thy heart ?
amen !
what ?
well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much .
go in , and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father , to propn ’ s cell to make confession and to be absolved .
marry , i will , and this is wisely done .
o most wicked fiend !
i ’ ll to the friar to know his remedy .
if all else fail , myself have power to die .
on propn , sir ?
the time is very short .
you say you do not know the lady ’ s mind .
i like it not .
now do you know the reason of this haste .
look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
happily met , my lady and my wife .
that may be , sir , when i may be a wife .
good morrow , cousin .
is the day so young ?
but new struck nine .
was that my father that went hence so fast ?
it was .
not having that which , having , makes them short .
in love ?
out .
of love ?
where shall we dine ? — o me !
that “ may be ” must be , love , on propn next .
what must be shall be .
that ’ s a certain text .
come you to make confession to this propn ?
to answer that , i should confess to you .
do not deny to him that you love me .
i will confess to you that i love him .
so will ye , i am sure , that you love me .
if i do so , it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face .
poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
my leisure serves me , pensive daughter , propn my lord , we must entreat the time alone .
propn shield i should disturb devotion ! — propn , on propn early will i rouse ye .
o propn , i already know thy grief .
i hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , on propn next be married to this county .
tell me not , propn , that thou hear ’ st of this , unless thou tell me how i may prevent it .
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , do thou but call my resolution wise , and with this knife i ’ ll help it presently .
hold , then .
propn is tomorrow .
tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .
let not the propn lie with thee in thy chamber .
no warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .
give me , give me !
love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
propn , dear propn .
you shall have none ill , sir , for i ’ ll try if they can lick their fingers .
how canst thou try them so ?
therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .
go , be gone .
we shall be much unfurnished for this time .
ay , forsooth .
see where she comes from shrift with merry look .
where i have learned me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests , and am enjoined by holy propn to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon .
send for the county .
go tell him of this .
i ’ ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .
i met the youthful lord at propn ' cell , and gave him what becomèd love i might , not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .
why , i am glad on propn .
this is well .
stand up .
ay , marry , go , i say , and fetch him hither.— now , afore propn , this reverend holy friar !
our whole city is much bound to him .
nurse , will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?
no , not till propn .
there is time enough .
we ’ ll to church tomorrow .
propn now near night .
tush , i will stir about , and all things shall be well , i warrant thee , wife .
go thou to propn , help to deck up her .
i ’ ll not to bed tonight .
let me alone .
i ’ ll play the housewife for this once .
ay , those attires are best .
what , are you busy , ho ?
need you my help ?
for , i am sure , you have your hands full all in this so sudden business .
good night .
propn knows when we shall meet again .
my dismal scene i needs must act alone .
come , vial .
what if this mixture do not work at all ?
shall i be married then tomorrow morning ?
lie thou there .
oh , look !
methinks i see my cousin ’ s ghost seeking out propn , that did spit his body upon a rapier ’ s point .
stay , propn , stay !
propn , propn , propn !
here ’ s drink .
i drink to thee .
no , coz , i rather weep .
good heart , at what ?
why , such is love ’ s transgression .
what is it else ?
a madness most discreet , a choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
propn , my coz .
soft !
i will go along .
and if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
propn , i have lost myself .
i am not here .
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
what , shall i groan and tell thee ?
propn !
why , no .
but sadly , tell me who .
hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , nurse .
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
come , stir , stir , stir !
the second cock hath crowed .
the curfew bell hath rung .
propn not for the cost .
go , you cot - quean , go .
get you to bed , faith .
you ’ ll be sick tomorrow for this night ’ s watching .
i have watched ere now all night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .
ay , you have been a mouse - hunt in your time , but i will watch you from such watching now .
a jealous hood , a jealous hood !
now , fellow , what is there ?
make haste , make haste , sirrah .
i have a head , sir , that will find out logs , and never trouble propn for the matter .
mass , and well said .
a merry whoreson , ha !
thou shalt be loggerhead .— good faith , ’ tis day .
wife !
what , ho ?
what , propn , i say !
go waken propn .
go and trim her up .
i ’ ll go and chat with propn .
hie , make haste , make haste .
the bridegroom he is come already .
make haste , i say .
propn !
what , mistress !
juliet ! —fast , i warrant her , propn why , lamb !
why , lady !
why , love , i say .
propn !
sweet - heart !
why , bride !
what , not a word ?
you take your pennyworths now .
how sound is she asleep !
ay , let the county take you in your bed .
he ’ ll fright you up , i ' faith .
will it not be ?
what noise is here ?
o lamentable day !
what is the matter ?
look , look .
o heavy day !
o me , o me !
my child , my only life , revive , look up , or i will die with propn propn , help !
for shame , bring propn forth .
her lord is come .
she ’ s dead , deceased , she ’ s dead .
alack the day !
alack the day .
she ’ s dead , she ’ s dead , she ’ s dead !
ha ?
let me see her .
out , alas !
she ’ s cold .
her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .
life and these lips have long been separated .
death lies on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
o lamentable day !
o woeful time .
death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
ready to go , but never to return .
death is my son - in - law .
death is my heir .
my daughter he hath wedded .
i will die , and leave him all .
life , living , all is propn propn .
have i thought long to see this morning ’ s face , and doth it give me such a sight as this ?
accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
most miserable hour that e'er time saw in lasting labor of his pilgrimage .
but one , poor one , one poor and loving child , but one thing to rejoice and solace in , and cruel death hath catched it from my sight !
o woe !
o woeful , woeful , woeful day !
never was seen so black a day as this .
o woeful day , o woeful day !
beguiled , divorcèd , wrongèd , spited , slain !
most detestable death , by thee beguiled , by cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown !
o love !
o life !
not life , but love in death .
despised , distressèd , hated , martyred , killed !
uncomfortable time , why camest thou now to murder , murder our solemnity ?
my soul , and not my child !
dead art thou !
peace , ho , for shame !
confusion ’ s cure lives not in these confusions .
propn and yourself had part in this fair maid .
now propn hath all ,
and all the better is it for the maid .
your part in her you could not keep from death , but propn keeps his part in eternal life .
the most you sought was her promotion , for ’ twas your heaven she should be advanced .
and weep ye now , seeing she is advanced above the clouds , as high as propn itself ?
oh , in this love , you love your child so ill that you run mad , seeing that she is well .
she ’ s not well married that lives married long , but she ’ s best married that dies married young .
our instruments to melancholy bells , our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , and all things change them to the contrary .
every one prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave .
the heavens do lour upon you for some ill . move them no more by crossing their high will .
faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
not a dump , we .
propn no time to play now .
you will not then ?
no .
i will then give it you soundly .
what will you give us ?
no money , on my faith , but the gleek .
i will give you the minstrel .
then i will give you the serving creature .
then will i lay the serving creature ’ s dagger on your pate .
i will carry no crotchets .
then have at you with my wit .
answer me like men .
marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
propn too .— what say you , propn propn ?
faith , i know not what to say .
i will say for you .
it is “ music with her silver sound ” because musicians have no gold for sounding .
what a pestilent knave is this same !
hang him , propn !
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep , my dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
ah me !
how sweet is love itself possessed when but love ’ s shadows are so rich in joy !
news from propn now , propn ?
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
how doth my lady ?
is my father well ?
how fares my propn ?
that i ask again , for nothing can be ill if she be well .
then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
her body sleeps in propn ' monument , and her immortal part with angels lives .
i saw her laid low in her kindred ’ s vault and presently took post to tell it you .
o , pardon me for bringing these ill news , since you did leave it for my office , sir .
a sick man in sadness makes his will , a word ill urged to one that is so ill .
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
a right good markman !
and she ’ s fair i love .
a right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
well , in that hit you miss .
she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , for beauty , starved with her severity , propn beauty off from all posterity .
she is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , to merit bliss by making me despair .
be ruled by me .
forget to think of her .
o , teach me how i should forget to think !
is it e'en so ?
then i defy you , stars !
thou know ’ st my lodging .
get me ink and paper , and hire post horses .
i will hence tonight .
i do beseech you , sir , have patience .
your looks are pale and wild , and do import some misadventure .
tush , thou art deceived .
leave me and do the thing i bid thee do .
propn thou no letters to me from the friar ?
no , my good lord .
no matter .
get thee gone , and hire those horses .
i ’ ll be with thee straight .
well , propn , i will lie with thee tonight .
let ’ s see for means .
o mischief , thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
as i remember , this should be the house .
being holiday , the beggar ’ s shop is shut .
what , ho !
propn !
who calls so loud ?
come hither , man .
i see that thou art poor .
hold , there is forty ducats .
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , and fear ’ st to die ?
famine is in thy cheeks .
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .
the world is not thy friend nor the world ’ s law .
the world affords no law to make thee rich .
buy food , and get thyself in flesh.— come , cordial and not poison , go with me to propn ’ s grave , for there must i use thee .
propn propn propn !
brother , ho !
this same should be the voice of propn propn .
welcome from propn .
what says propn ?
or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
so that my speed to propn there was stayed .
who bare my letter , then , to propn ?
unhappy fortune !
brother , i ’ ll go and bring it thee .
now must i to the monument alone .
within this three hours will fair juliet wake .
but i will write again to propn , and keep her at my cell till propn come .
poor living corse , closed in a dead man ’ s tomb !
give me thy torch , boy .
hence , and stand aloof .
yet put it out , for i would not be seen .
give me those flowers .
do as i bid thee , go .
yet i will adventure .
the boy gives warning something doth approach .
what cursèd foot wanders this way tonight to cross my obsequies and true love ’ s rite ?
what with a torch !
propn me , night , awhile .
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
i will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
so shalt thou show me friendship .
take thou that .
good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .
fly hence and leave me .
think upon these gone .
let them affright thee .
i beseech thee , youth , put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury .
o , be gone !
stay not , be gone .
live , and hereafter say a madman ’ s mercy bid thee run away .
i do defy thy commination and apprehend thee for a felon here .
wilt thou provoke me ?
then have at thee , boy !
o propn , they fight !
i will go call the watch .
open the tomb .
propn ’ s kinsman , noble propn propn .
what said my man , when my betossèd soul did not attend him as we rode ?
i think he told me propn should have married propn .
said he not so ?
or did i dream it so ?
i ’ ll bury thee in a triumphant grave .
a grave ?
oh , no .
a lantern , slaughtered youth , for here lies propn , and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light .
death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , propn had no power yet upon thy beauty .
thou art not conquered .
o , what more favor can i do to thee , than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy ?
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous , and that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
here , here will i remain with worms that are thy chamber maids .
oh , here will i set up my everlasting rest , and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world - wearied flesh .
eyes , look your last .
arms , take your last embrace .
thy drugs are quick .
thus with a kiss i die .
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .
propn propn be my speed !
how oft tonight have my old feet stumbled at graves ! —who propn there ?
here ’ s one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
propn be upon you !
tell me , good my friend , what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
as i discern , it burneth in the propn ' monument .
who is it ?
propn .
how long hath he been there ?
full half an hour .
go with me to the vault .
i dare not , sir .
stay , then .
i ’ ll go alone .
fear comes upon me .
oh , much i fear some ill unthrifty thing .
as i did sleep under this yew tree here , i dreamt my master and another fought , and that my master slew him .
propn propn , alack , what blood is this , which stains the stony entrance of the sepulcher ?
o comfortable propn !
where is my lord ?
i do remember well where i should be , and there i am .
where is my propn ?
i hear some noise .
propn , come from that nest of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
a greater power than we can contradict propn thwarted our intents .
come , come away .
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , and propn too .
come , i ’ ll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
a cup , closed in my true love ’ s hand ?
poison , i see , hath been his timeless end.— o churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop to help me after ?
i will kiss thy lips .
haply some poison yet doth hang on them , to make me die with a restorative .
propn , noise ?
then i ’ ll be brief .
o happy dagger , this is thy sheath .
there rust and let me die .
this is the place .
there , where the torch doth burn .
the ground is bloody .— search about the churchyard .
pitiful sight !
here lies the county slain , and propn bleeding , warm and newly dead , who here hath lain these two days buried.— go , tell the propn .
run to the capulets .
raise up the montagues .
some others search .
here ’ s propn ’ s man .
we found him in the churchyard .
hold him in safety till the propn come hither .
here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .
we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard ’ s side .
a great suspicion .
stay the friar too .
what misadventure is so early up that calls our person from our morning rest ?
what should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?
oh , the people in the street cry “ propn , ” some “ propn , ” and some “ propn , ” and all run with open outcry toward our monument .
search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
o heavens !
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
this dagger hath mista'en — for , propn , his house is empty on the back of propn , and it mis - sheathèd in my daughter ’ s bosom .
o me !
this sight of death is as a bell , that warns my old age to a sepulcher .
alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .
grief of my son ’ s exile hath stopped her breath .
what further woe conspires against mine age ?
look , and thou shalt see .
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring , their head , their true descent , and then will i be general of your woes , and lead you even to death .
meantime forbear , and let mischance be slave to patience.— bring forth the parties of suspicion .
i am the greatest , able to do least , yet most suspected , as the time and place doth make against me , of this direful murder .
and here i stand , both to impeach and purge , myself condemnèd and myself excused .
then say at once what thou dost know in this .
i will be brief , for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale .
meantime i writ to propn , that he should hither come as this dire night , to help to take her from her borrowed grave , being the time the potion ’ s force should cease .
what can he say in this ?
their course of love , the tidings of her death .
montague !
o brother propn , give me thy hand .
but now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
but saying o'er what i have said before .
my child is yet a stranger in the world .
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years .
younger than she are happy mothers made .
and too soon marred are those so early made .
but woo her , gentle propn , get her heart .
this night i hold an old accustomed feast , propn i have invited many a guest such as i love .
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star - crossed lovers take their life , whose misadventured piteous overthrows propn with their death bury their parents ' strife .
the fearful passage of their death - marked love and the continuance of their parents ' rage , which , but their children ’ s end , naught could remove , is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage— the which , if you with patient ears attend , what here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .
such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well - appareled propn on the heel of limping winter treads .
even such delight among fresh fennel buds shall you this night propn at my house .
go , sirrah , trudge about through fair propn .
find them out whose names are written here ?
it is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .
but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .
take thou some new infection to thy eye , and the rank poison of the old will die .
your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
for what , i pray thee ?
why propn , art thou mad ?
not mad , but bound more than a madman is , shut up in prison , kept without my food , whipped and tormented and — good e'en , good fellow .
propn ' i ' good e'en .
i pray , sir , can you read ?
ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
perhaps you have learned it without book .
but i pray , can you read anything you see ?
ay , if i know the letters and the language .
ye say honestly .
stay , fellow .
i can read .
propn propn and his wife and daughters ; propn propn and his beauteous sisters ; the lady widow of propn ; propn propn and his lovely nieces ; propn and his brother propn ; propn uncle propn , his wife and daughters ; my fair niece propn and propn ;
propn propn and his cousin propn ; propn and the lively propn . ” a fair assembly .
propn should they come ?
up .
propn ?
to supper ?
to our house .
whose house ?
my master ’ s .
indeed , i should have asked thee that before .
now i ’ ll tell you without asking .
my master is the great rich propn , and if you be not of the house of propn , i pray come and crush a cup of wine .
rest you merry !
at this same ancient feast of propn ’ s propn the fair propn whom thou so loves with all the admired beauties of propn .
go thither , and with unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show , and i will make thee think thy swan a crow .
one fairer than my love ?
the all - seeing sun propn saw her match since first the world begun .
i ’ ll go along , no such sight to be shown , but to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
propn , where ’ s my daughter ?
call her forth to me .
now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old i bade her come .
what , lamb !
how now , who calls ?
your mother .
propn , i am here .
what is your will ?
thou know ’ st my daughter propn of a pretty age .
faith , i can tell her age unto an hour .
she ’ s not fourteen .
i ’ ll lay fourteen of my teeth — and yet , to my teen be it spoken , i have but four — she is not fourteen .
even or odd , of all days in the year , come propn propn at night shall she be fourteen .
propn and she — propn rest all christian souls ! — were of an age .
well , propn is with propn .
she was too good for me .
but , as i said , on propn propn at night shall she be fourteen .
that shall she .
marry , i remember it well .
propn since the earthquake now eleven years , and she was weaned — i never shall forget it— of all the days of the year , upon that day .
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug , sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .
my lord and you were then at propn propn , i do bear a brain .— but , as i said , when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
shake ! ” quoth the dovehouse .
twas no need , i trow , to bid me trudge .
yea , ” quoth he , “ dost thou fall upon thy face ?
and , pretty fool , it stinted and said “ ay . ” enough of this .
i pray thee , hold thy peace .
yes , madam .
yet i can not choose but laugh to think it should leave crying and say “ ay . ” and yet , i warrant , it had upon its brow a bump as big as a young cockerel ’ s stone , a perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .
yea , ” quoth my husband , “ propn upon thy face ?
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age .
wilt thou not , jule ? ” it stinted and said “ ay . ” and stint thou too , i pray thee , propn , say i .
propn mark thee to his grace !
thou wast the prettiest babe that propn i nursed .
an i might live to see thee married once , i have my wish .
tell me , daughter propn , how stands your disposition to be married ?
it is an honor that i dream not of .
well , think of marriage now .
younger than you here in propn , ladies of esteem are made already mothers .
by my count , i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid .
thus then in brief : the valiant propn seeks you for his love .
a man , young lady !
propn ’ s summer hath not such a flower .
what say you ?
i ’ ll look to like if looking liking move .
but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
i must hence to wait .
i beseech you , follow straight .
we follow thee .— propn , the county stays .
go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
what , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
or shall we on without apology ?
the date is out of such prolixity .
but let them measure us by what they will .
give me a torch .
i am not for this ambling .
nay , gentle propn , we must have you dance .
not i , believe me .
you have dancing shoes with nimble soles .
i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i can not move .
you are a lover .
borrow propn ’ s wings and soar with them above a common bound .
i am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft to soar with his light feathers , and so bound , i can not bound a pitch above dull woe .
under love ’ s heavy burden do i sink .
i mean , an we be in choler , we ’ ll draw .
i strike quickly , being moved .
but thou art not quickly moved to strike .
to move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .
a dog of that house shall move me to stand .
and to sink in it , should you burthen love— too great oppression for a tender thing .
is love a tender thing ?
it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
if love be rough with you , be rough with love .
let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .
come , we burn daylight , ho !
nay , that ’ s not so .
we waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .
and we mean well in going to this mask , but ’ tis no wit to go .
why , may one ask ?
i dreamt a dream tonight .
and so did i .
well , what was yours ?
that dreamers often lie .
in bed asleep while they do dream things true .
oh , then , i see propn propn hath been with you .
sometime she gallops propn a courtier ’ s nose , and then dreams he of smelling out a suit .
and sometime comes she with a tithe - pig ’ s tail tickling a parson ’ s nose as he lies asleep , then he dreams of another benefice .
this is she— peace , peace , propn , peace !
this wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .
supper is done , and we shall come too late .
on , lusty gentlemen .
strike , drum .
where ’ s propn , that he helps not to take away ?
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men ’ s hands , and they unwashed too , ’ tis a foul thing .
away with the joint - stools , remove the court - cupboard , look to the plate .
good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in propn propn and propn .— propn and propn !
ay , boy , ready .
you are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
we can not be here and there too .
cheerly , boys .
be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .
welcome , gentlemen !
she that makes dainty , she , i ’ ll swear , hath corns .
am i come near ye now ? — welcome , gentlemen !
propn propn , thirty years .
propn more , ’ tis more .
his son is elder , sir .
his son is thirty .
will you tell me that ?
his son was but a ward two years ago .
i know not , sir .
oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
this , by his voice , should be a propn what , dares the slave come hither , covered with an antic face , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
wherefore storm you so ?
propn , this is a propn , our foe , a villain that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night .
propn propn is it ?
propn he , that villain propn .
content thee , gentle coz .
let him alone .
he bears him like a portly gentleman , and , to say truth , propn brags of him to be a virtuous and well - governed youth .
i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement .
therefore be patient .
take no note of him .
you ’ ll not endure him !
why , uncle , ’ tis a shame .
go to , go to .
you are a saucy boy .
is propn so , indeed ?
this trick may chance to scathe you , i know what .
you must contrary me .
i ’ ll make you quiet .— what , cheerly , my hearts !
have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
o , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .
they pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
then move not , while my prayer ’ s effect i take .
thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .
then have my lips the sin that they have took .
sin from thy lips ?
give me my sin again .
you kiss by th ' book .
propn , your mother craves a word with you .
what is her mother ?
i nursed her daughter that you talked withal .
i tell you , he that can lay hold of her propn have the chinks .
nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .
we have a trifling foolish banquet towards.— is it e'en so ?
i ’ ll to my rest .
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men .
propn all one .
i will show myself a tyrant .
the heads of the maids ?
ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
take it in what sense thou wilt .
they must take it in sense that feel it .
me they shall feel while i am able to stand , and ’ tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh .
propn well thou art not fish .
draw thy tool !
my naked weapon is out .
come hither , propn .
what is yond gentleman ?
the son and heir of old propn .
what ’ s he that now is going out of door ?
marry , that , i think , be young propn .
i know not .
go ask his name .— if he be married .
what ’ s this ?
what ’ s this ?
the strangers all are gone .
now propn is beloved and loves again , alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks , but to his foe supposed he must complain , and she steal love ’ s sweet bait from fearful hooks .
and she as much in love , her means much less to meet her new beloved anywhere .
but passion lends them power , time means , to meet , tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
can i go forward when my heart is here ?
he is wise , and , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .
he ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .
call , good propn .
nay , i ’ ll conjure too !
propn !
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !
speak but one rhyme , and i am satisfied .
cry but “ ay me ! ” pronounce but “ love ” and “ dove . ” speak to my gossip propn one fair word , one nickname for her purblind son and heir , propn propn propn , he that shot so true when propn propn loved the beggar maid.— he heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .
an if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
this can not anger him .
my invocation is fair and honest .
blind is his love and best befits the dark .
if love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone.— o propn , that she were !
go , then , for ’ tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found .
it is the east , and propn is the sun .
her vestal livery is but sick and green , and none but fools do wear it .
cast it off !
it is my lady .
oh , it is my love .
oh , that she knew she were !
she speaks , yet she says nothing .
what of that ?
her eye discourses .
propn not to me she speaks .
two of the fairest stars in all the propn , having some business , do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return .
her eye in propn would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night .
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand .
oh , that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek !
o propn , propn !
wherefore art thou propn ?
propn but thy name that is my enemy .
henceforth i never will be propn .
what man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , so stumblest on my counsel ?
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am .
art thou not propn , and a propn ?
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb , and the place death , considering who thou art , if any of my kinsmen find thee here .
therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .
if they do see thee they will murder thee .
look thou but sweet , and i am proof against their enmity .
i would not for the world they saw thee here .
my life were better ended by their hate than death proroguèd , wanting of thy love .
thou know ’ st the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .
dost thou love me ?
i know thou wilt say “ ay , ” and i will take thy word .
what shall i swear by ?
do not swear at all .
or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i ’ ll believe thee .
if my heart ’ s dear love— well , do not swear .
although i joy in thee , i have no joy of this contract tonight .
this bud of love , by summer ’ s ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast .
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?
propn ' exchange of thy love ’ s faithful vow for mine .
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it , and yet i would it were to give again .
propn thou withdraw it ?
for what purpose , love ?
but to be frank , and give it thee again .
and yet i wish but for the thing i have .
my bounty is as boundless as the sea , my love as deep .
i hear some noise within .
dear love , adieu.— propn , good propn propn , be true .
stay but a little .
i will come again .
o blessèd , blessèd night !
i am afeard , being in night , all this is but a dream , too flattering sweet to be substantial .
three words , dear propn , and good night indeed .
fear me not .
let us take the law of our sides .
let them begin .
i will frown as i pass by , and let them take it as they list .
nay , as they dare .
i will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
i do bite my thumb , sir .
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
do you quarrel , sir ?
propn , sir ?
no , sir .
tomorrow will i send .
so thrive my soul— a thousand times good night !
a thousand times the worse to want thy light .
bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , else would i tear the cave where propn lies , and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , with repetition of “ my propn ! ” it is my soul that calls upon my name .
how silver - sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , like softest music to attending ears !
propn !
my nyas ?
what o'clock tomorrow shall i send to thee ?
by the hour of nine .
i will not fail .
propn twenty year till then .
i have forgot why i did call thee back .
let me stand here till thou remember it .
and i ’ ll still stay , to have thee still forget , forgetting any other home but this .
propn almost morning .
and yet no further than a wanton ’ s bird , that lets it hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , and with a silken thread plucks it back again , so loving - jealous of his liberty .
i would i were thy bird .
sweet , so would i .
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing .
good night , good night !
parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow .
sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .
would i were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .
hence will i to my ghostly friar ’ s close cell , his help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
the gray - eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , and fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day ’ s path and propn ’ s fiery wheels .
now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , the day to cheer and night ’ s dank dew to dry , i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious - juicèd flowers .
the earth , that ’ s nature ’ s mother , is her tomb .
and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find , many for many virtues excellent , none but for some and yet all different .
oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .
for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give .
virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , and vice sometime by action dignified .
within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power .
two such opposèd kings encamp them still , in man as well as herbs — grace and rude will .
and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
good morrow , propn .
benedicite .
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
young son , it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
care keeps his watch in every old man ’ s eye , and where care lodges , sleep will never lie .
but where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .
therefore thy earliness doth me assure propn art uproused by some distemperature .
or if not so , then here i hit it right : our propn hath not been in bed tonight .
that last is true .
the sweeter rest was mine .
with propn , my ghostly propn ?
that ’ s my good son .
but where hast thou been , then ?
i ’ ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .
both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies .
i bear no hatred , blessèd man , for , propn , my intercession likewise steads my foe .
here comes your father .
never make denial .
i must and will have propn to my wife .
now , propn propn , how speed you with my daughter ?
how but well , sir ?
why , how now , daughter propn ?
in your dumps ?
call you me daughter ?
propn , propn thus : yourself and all the world that talked of her have talked amiss of her .
i ’ ll see thee hanged on propn first .
propn , propn : she says she ’ ll see thee hanged first .
is this your speeding ?
nay , then , good night our part .
be patient , gentlemen .
i choose her for myself .
if she and i be pleased , what ’ s that to you ?
propn bargained ’ twixt us twain , being alone , that she shall still be curst in company .
i tell you , ’ tis incredible to believe how much she loves me .
o , the kindest propn !
o , you are novices !
propn a world to see , how tame , when men and women are alone , a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.— give me thy hand , propn .
i will unto propn to buy apparel ' gainst the wedding day .
propn send you joy , propn .
propn a match .
amen , say we .
we will be witnesses .
propn , and wife , and gentlemen , adieu .
i will to propn .
propn comes apace .
we will be married o ' propn .
was ever match clapped up so suddenly ?
propn bring you gain or perish on the seas .
the gain i seek is quiet in the match .
no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch .
but now , propn , to your younger daughter .
now is the day we long have lookèd for .
i am your neighbor , and was suitor first .
youngling , thou canst not love so dear as propn propn , thy love doth freeze .
but thine doth fry .
skipper , stand back .
propn age that nourisheth .
content you , gentlemen .
i will compound this strife .
first , as you know , my house within the city is richly furnishèd with plate and gold , basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands ; my hangings all of tyrian tapestry , in ivory coffers i have stuffed my crowns , in cypress chests my arras counterpoints , costly apparel , tents , and canopies , fine linen , propn cushions bossed with pearl , propn of propn gold in needlework , pewter and brass , and all things that belong to house or housekeeping .
then , at my farm i have a hundred milch - kine to the pail , six score fat oxen standing in my stalls , and all things answerable to this portion .
two thousand ducats by the year of land !
nay , i have offered all , i have no more , and she can have no more than all i have .
i must confess your offer is the best , and , let your father make her the assurance , she is your own ; else , you must pardon me .
if you should die before him , where ’ s her dower ?
and may not young men die as well as old ?
well , gentlemen , i am thus resolved : on propn next , you know my daughter propn is to be married .
i think ’ twas propn that your propn means .
propn very true .
thou didst it excellent .
there is a lord will hear you play tonight ; but i am doubtful of your modesties , lest over - eyeing of his odd behavior— for yet his propn never heard a play— you break into some merry passion and so offend him .
go , sirrah , take them to the buttery and give them friendly welcome every one .
propn , good neighbor .
sirrah young gamester , your father were a fool to give thee all and in his waning age propn foot under thy table .
propn , a toy !
an old italian fox is not so kind , my boy .
a vengeance on your crafty withered hide !
fathers commonly do get their children .
but in this case of wooing , a child shall get a sire , if i fail not of my cunning .
his lecture will be done ere you have tuned .
where left we last ?
here , madam : propn them .
now let me see if i can conster it .
i must believe my master ; else , i promise you , i should be arguing still upon that doubt .
but let it rest .— now , propn , to you .
good master , take it not unkindly , pray , that i have been thus pleasant with you both .
call you this “ gamut ” ?
propn , i like it not .
old fashions please me best .
propn , your father prays you leave your books and help to dress your sister ’ s chamber up .
you know tomorrow is the wedding day .
propn , sweet masters both .
i must be gone .
but i have cause to pry into this pedant .
methinks he looks as though he were in love .
no shame but mine .
now must the world point at poor propn and say , “ propn , there is mad propn ’ s wife , if it would please him come and marry her ! ” upon my life , propn means but well , whatever fortune stays him from his word : though he be blunt , i know him passing wise ; though he be merry , yet withal he ’ s honest .
would propn had never seen him , though !
go , girl .
i can not blame thee now to weep , for such an injury would vex a very saint , much more a shrew of thy impatient humor .
propn , master !
news , old news , and such news as you never heard of !
is it new and old too ?
how may that be ?
why , is it not news to hear of propn propn coming ?
is he come ?
why , no , sir .
what then ?
he is coming .
when will he be here ?
when he stands where i am and sees you there .
who comes with him ?
a monster , a very monster in apparel , and not like a christian footboy or a gentleman ’ s lackey .
i am glad he ’ s come , howsoe'er he comes .
why , sir , he comes not .
propn thou not say he comes ?
who ?
that propn came ?
ay , that propn came .
no , sir , i say his horse comes , with him on his back .
why , that ’ s all one .
nay , by propn propn , i hold you a penny , a horse and a man is more than one and yet not many .
you are welcome , sir .
see this dispatched with all the haste thou canst : propn i ’ ll give thee more instructions .
i know the boy will well usurp the grace , propn , gait , and action of a gentlewoman .
i long to hear him call the drunkard “ husband , ” and how my men will stay themselves from laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant .
i ’ ll in to counsel them .
where is my love ?
why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear .
but where is propn ?
i stay too long from her .
see not your bride in these unreverent robes .
go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine .
not i , believe me .
thus i ’ ll visit her .
but thus , i trust , you will not marry her .
good sooth , even thus .
could i repair what she will wear in me as i can change these poor accoutrements , ' twere well for propn and better for myself .
but what a fool am i to chat with you , when i should bid good morrow to my bride and seal the title with a lovely kiss !
he hath some meaning in his mad attire .
we will persuade him , be it possible , to put on better ere he go to church .
i ’ ll after him , and see the event of this .
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope and marry sweet propn with consent .
we ’ ll overreach the graybeard , propn , the narrow - prying father , propn , the quaint musician , amorous propn , all for my master ’ s sake , propn .
propn propn , came you from the church ?
as willingly as e'er i came from school .
a bridegroom , say you ?
why , he ’ s a devil , a devil , a very fiend .
propn , she ’ s a lamb , a dove , a fool to him !
now take them up , ” quoth he , “ if any list . ” trembled and shook , for why he stamped and swore as if the vicar meant to cozen him .
but after many ceremonies done , he calls for wine .
this done , he took the bride about the neck and kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack that at the parting all the church did echo .
such a mad marriage never was before .
propn , hark !
i hear the minstrels play .
is ’ t possible you will away tonight ?
make it no wonder .
if you knew my business , you would entreat me rather go than stay .
and , honest company , i thank you all , that have beheld me give away myself to this most patient , sweet and virtuous wife .
let me entreat you .
it can not be .
let me entreat you .
i am content .
are you content to stay ?
i am content you shall entreat me stay , but yet not stay , entreat me how you can .
now , if you love me , stay .
propn , my horse .
ay , sir , they be ready .
the oats have eaten the horses .
the door is open , sir .
there lies your way .
for me , i ’ ll not be gone till i please myself .
o propn , content thee .
prithee , be not angry .
i will be angry .
what hast thou to propn propn , be quiet .
he shall stay my leisure .
ay , marry , sir , now it begins to work .
gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner .
i see a woman may be made a fool if she had not a spirit to resist .
i ’ ll buckler thee against a million .
nay , let them go , a couple of quiet ones .
went they not quickly , i should die with laughing .
that , being mad herself , she ’ s madly mated .
neighbors and friends , though bride and bridegroom wants for to supply the places at the table , you know there wants no junkets at the feast .
she shall , propn .
come , gentlemen , let ’ s go .
propn , fie on all tired jades , on all mad masters , and all foul ways !
was ever man so beaten ?
was ever man so ' rayed ?
was ever man so weary ?
i am sent before to make a fire , and they are coming after to warm them .
now , were not i a little pot and soon hot , my very lips might freeze to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , my heart in my belly , ere i should come by a fire to thaw me .
but i with blowing the fire shall warm myself .
who is that calls so coldly ?
a piece of ice .
if thou doubt it , thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck .
a fire , good propn .
is my master and his wife coming , propn ?
oh , ay , propn , ay , and therefore fire , fire .
cast on no water .
is she so hot a shrew as she ’ s reported ?
she was , good propn , before this frost .
why , thy horn is a foot , and so long am i , at the least .
i prithee , good propn , tell me , how goes the world ?
do thy duty , and have thy duty , for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death .
there ’ s fire ready .
and therefore , good propn , the news .
why , therefore fire , for i have caught extreme cold .
where ’ s the cook ?
is supper ready , the house trimmed , rushes strewed , cobwebs swept , the servingmen in their new fustian , their white stockings , and every officer his wedding garment on ?
be the propn fair within , the propn fair without , the carpets laid , and everything in order ?
for propn ’ s sake , a pot of small ale .
will propn please your propn taste of these conserves ?
what raiment will your propn wear today ?
i am propn propn .
all ready .
and therefore , i pray thee , news .
first , know my horse is tired , my master and mistress fallen out .
how ?
out of their saddles into the dirt , and thereby hangs a tale .
let ’ s ha ' propn , good propn .
lend thine ear .
here .
there !
this ’ tis to feel a tale , not to hear a tale .
and therefore propn called a sensible tale .
and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning .
now i begin : propn , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress— both of one horse ?
what ’ s that to thee ?
why , a horse .
tell thou the tale !
ay , and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home .
but what talk i of this ?
call forth propn , propn , propn , propn , propn , propn , and the rest .
let their heads be slickly combed , their blue coats brushed , and their garters of an indifferent knit .
let them curtsy with their left legs , and not presume to touch a hair of my master ’ s horse - tail till they kiss their hands .
are they all ready ?
they are .
call them forth .
why , she hath a face of her own .
who knows not that ?
thou , it seems , that calls for company to countenance her .
i call them forth to credit her .
why , she comes to borrow nothing of them .
welcome home , propn .
how now , propn ?
what , propn !
propn propn !
how now , old lad ?
e'en at hand , alighted by this .
where be these knaves ?
here , here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir ! ” you loggerheaded and unpolished grooms !
where is the foolish knave i sent before ?
here , sir , as foolish as i was before .
you peasant swain !
you whoreson malt - horse drudge !
did i not bid thee meet me in the park and bring along these rascal knaves with thee ?
propn ’ s coat , sir , was not fully made , and propn ’ s pumps were all unpinked i ' th ' heel .
there was no link to color propn ’ s hat , and propn ’ s dagger was not come from sheathing .
there were none fine but propn , propn , and propn .
go , rascals , go , and fetch my supper in .
one , propn , that you must kiss and be acquainted with.— where are my slippers ?
shall i have some water ? — come , propn , and wash , and welcome heartily.— you whoreson villain !
will you let it fall ?
patience , i pray you !
twas a fault unwilling .
will you give thanks , sweet propn , or else shall i ? — what ’ s this ?
propn ?
ay .
who brought it ?
i .
what dogs are these !
where is the rascal cook ?
how durst you , villains , bring it from the dresser and serve it thus to me that love it not ?
there , take it to you , trenchers , cups , and all !
i pray you , husband , be not so disquiet .
the meat was well , if you were so contented .
i tell thee , propn , ’ twas burnt and dried away .
come , i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .
propn , didst ever see the like ?
he kills her in her own humor .
where is he ?
away , away , for he is coming hither !
thus have i politicly begun my reign , and ’ tis my hope to end successfully .
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty , and , till she stoop , she must not be full - gorged , for then she never looks upon her lure .
another way i have to man my haggard , to make her come and know her keeper ’ s call .
that is , to watch her , as we watch these kites that bate and beat and will not be obedient .
she ate no meat today , nor none shall eat .
last night she slept not , nor tonight she shall not .
as with the meat , some undeservèd fault i ’ ll find about the making of the bed , and here i ’ ll fling the pillow , there the bolster , this way the coverlet , another way the sheets .
and , in conclusion , she shall watch all night , and if she chance to nod i ’ ll rail and brawl , and with the clamor keep her still awake .
he that knows better how to tame a shrew , now let him speak ; ’ tis charity to show .
is ’ t possible , friend propn , that mistress propn propn fancy any other but lucentio ?
what , master , read you ?
first resolve me that .
and may you prove , sir , master of your art .
i tell thee , propn , this is wonderful !
mistake no more .
know , sir , that i am called propn .
see how they kiss and court !
fie on her !
see how beastly she doth court him !
would all the world but he had quite forsworn !
for me , that i may surely keep mine oath , i will be married to a wealthy widow , propn three days pass , which hath as long loved me as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard .
and so farewell , propn propn .
propn in women , not their beauteous looks , shall win my love , and so i take my leave , in resolution as i swore before .
what , would you make me mad ?
am not i propn propn , old propn ’ s son of propn propn , by birth a peddler , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bearherd , and now by present profession a tinker ?
oh , this is it that makes your servants droop !
o noble lord , bethink thee of thy birth , call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment , and banish hence these abject lowly dreams .
look how thy servants do attend on thee , each in his office ready at thy beck .
wilt thou have music ?
propn !
apollo plays , and twenty cagèd nightingales do sing : or wilt thou sleep ?
we ’ ll have thee to a couch propn and sweeter than the lustful bed on purpose trimmed up for propn .
or wilt thou hunt ?
nay , i have ta'en you napping , gentle love , and have forsworn you with propn .
propn , you jest .
but have you both forsworn me ?
propn , we have .
then we are rid of propn .
i ' faith , he ’ ll have a lusty widow now that shall be wooed and wedded in a day .
propn give him joy !
ay , and he ’ ll tame her .
he says so , propn ?
the taming school ?
what , is there such a place ?
ay , mistress , and propn is the master , that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue .
what is he , propn ?
and what of him , propn ?
take in your love , and then let me alone .
propn save you , sir .
you are welcome .
of propn .
my life , sir !
how , i pray ?
for that goes hard .
propn death for anyone in propn to come to propn .
know you not the cause ?
propn marvel , but that you are but newly come , you might have heard it else proclaimed about .
alas , sir , it is worse for me than so , for i have bills for money by exchange from propn , and must here deliver them .
ay , sir , in propn have i often been , pisa renownèd for grave citizens .
o sir , i do , and will repute you ever the patron of my life and liberty .
in all these circumstances i ’ ll instruct you .
no , no , forsooth , i dare not for my life .
the more my wrong , the more his spite appears .
what , did he marry me to famish me ?
if not , elsewhere they meet with charity .
but i , who never knew how to entreat , nor never needed that i should entreat , am starved for meat , giddy for lack of sleep , with oaths kept waking and with brawling fed .
and that which spites me more than all these wants , he does it under name of perfect love , as who should say , if i should sleep or eat , ' twere deadly sickness or else present death .
what say you to a neat ’ s foot ?
propn passing good .
i prithee let me have it .
i fear it is too choleric a meat .
propn propn , fetch it me .
i can not tell .
i fear ’ tis choleric .
what say you to a piece of beef and mustard ?
ay , but the mustard is too hot a little .
why then , the beef , and let the mustard rest .
nay then , i will not .
you shall have the mustard or else you get no beef of propn .
then both , or one , or anything thou wilt .
why then , the mustard without the beef .
go , get thee gone , i say .
propn , what cheer ?
propn up thy spirits .
here love , thou seest how diligent i am , to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee .
i am sure , sweet propn , this kindness merits thanks .
what , not a word ?
nay , then thou propn it not and all my pains is sorted to no proof .
here , take away this dish .
i pray you , let it stand .
i thank you , sir .
come , mistress propn , i ’ ll bear you company .
come , tailor , let us see these ornaments .
lay forth the gown .
what news with you , sir ?
here is the cap your worship did bespeak .
why , this was molded on a porringer !
a velvet dish !
propn , fie , ’ tis lewd and filthy !
why , ’ tis a cockle or a walnut shell , a knack , a toy , a trick , a baby ’ s cap .
away with it !
come , let me have a bigger .
i ’ ll have no bigger .
when you are gentle , you shall have one too , and not till then .
why , sir , i trust i may have leave to speak , and speak i will .
i am no child , no babe .
your betters have endured me say my mind , and if you can not , best you stop your ears .
why , thou say ’ st true .
it is a paltry cap , a custard - coffin , a bauble , a silken pie .
i love thee well in that thou propn it not .
love me or love me not , i like the cap , and it i will have , or i will have none .
thy gown ?
why , ay .
come , tailor , let us see propn .
o mercy , propn !
what ’ s this ?
a sleeve ?
propn like a demi - cannon .
what , up and down , carved like an apple tart ?
here ’ s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash , like to a censer in a barber ’ s shop .
why , what i ' propn ’ s name , tailor , propn thou this ?
you bid me make it orderly and well , according to the fashion and the time .
marry , and did .
but if you be remembered , i did not bid you mar it to the time .
i ’ ll none of it .
hence , make your best of it .
i never saw a better - fashioned gown , more quaint , more pleasing , nor more commendable .
why , true , he means to make a puppet of thee .
thou liest , thou thread , thou thimble , thou yard , three - quarters , half - yard , quarter , nail !
thou flea , thou nit , thou winter cricket thou !
braved in mine own house with a skein of thread ?
i tell thee , i , that thou hast marred her gown .
your worship is deceived .
the gown is made just as my master had direction .
propn gave order how it should be done .
i gave him no order .
i gave him the stuff .
but how did you desire it should be made ?
marry , sir , with needle and thread .
but did you not request to have it cut ?
face not me .
thou hast braved many men ; brave not me .
i will neither be faced nor braved .
i say unto thee , i bid thy master cutout the gown , but i did not bid him cut it to pieces .
why , here is the note of the fashion to testify .
read it .
the note lies in propn throat , if he say i said so .
dost thou love pictures ?
thou hast a lady far more beautiful than any woman in this waning age .
and till the tears that she hath shed for thee like envious floods o'errun her lovely face , she was the fairest creature in the world— and yet she is inferior to none .
i confess the cape .
i confess two sleeves .
ay , there ’ s the villany .
error i ' the bill , sir , error i ' the bill !
i commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again , and that i ’ ll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble .
i am for thee straight .
take thou the bill , give me thy mete- yard , and spare not me .
propn - a - mercy , propn !
then he shall have no odds .
well , sir , in brief , the gown is not for me .
you are i ' the right , sir , ’ tis for my mistress .
go , take it up unto thy master ’ s use .
villain , not for thy life !
take up my mistress ' gown for thy master ’ s use !
why , sir , what ’ s your conceit in that ?
o , sir , the conceit is deeper than you think for .
take up my mistress ' gown to his master ’ s use !
o , fie , fie , fie !
well , come , my propn .
what , is the jay more precious than the lark because his feathers are more beautiful ?
or is the adder better than the eel because his painted skin contents the eye ?
oh , no , good propn .
if thou account ’ st it shame , lay it on me , and therefore frolic !
we will hence forthwith to feast and sport us at thy father ’ s house .
i dare assure you , sir , ’ tis almost two , and ’ twill be supper time ere you come there .
it shall be seven ere i go to horse .
look what i speak , or do , or think to do , you are still crossing it .
sirs , let propn alone .
i will not go today , and ere i do it shall be what o'clock i say it is .
ay , what else ?
and but i be deceived , propn propn may remember me , near twenty years ago , in propn , where we were lodgers at the propn .
i warrant you .
but , sir , here comes your boy .
propn , fear not me .
i told him that your father was at propn , and that you looked for him this day in propn .
here comes propn .
set your countenance , sir .
propn propn , you are happily propn propn , this is the gentleman i told you of .
i pray you stand good father to me now .
give me propn for my patrimony .
propn , pardon me in what i have to say .
your plainness and your shortness please me well .
right true it is your son propn here doth love my daughter and she loveth him , or both dissemble deeply their affections .
your son shall have my daughter with consent .
not in my house , propn , for you know pitchers have ears , and i have many servants .
besides , old propn is heark'ning still , and happily we might be interrupted .
i pray the gods she may , with all my heart !
propn .
what sayest thou , propn ?
you saw my master wink and laugh upon you ?
propn , what of that ?
i pray thee , moralize them .
then thus : propn is safe , talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son .
and what of him ?
his daughter is to be brought by you to the supper .
and then ?
the old priest at propn propn propn propn is at your command at all hours .
and what of all this ?
i can not tell , except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance .
take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum .
to th ' church take the priest , clerk , and some sufficient honest witnesses .
if this be not that you look for , i have no more to say , but bid propn farewell forever and a day .
i knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit , and so may you , sir .
and so adieu , sir .
my master hath appointed me to go to propn propn ’ s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix .
she will be pleased .
then wherefore should i doubt ?
it shall go hard if “ propn ” go without her .
come on , i ' propn ’ s name , once more toward our father ’ s .
propn propn , how bright and goodly shines the moon !
the moon ?
the sun !
it is not moonlight now .
i say it is the moon that shines so bright .
i know it is the sun that shines so bright .
now , by my mother ’ s son , and that ’ s myself , it shall be moon , or star , or what i list , or e'er i journey to your father ’ s house .
i say it is the moon .
i know it is the moon .
nay , then you lie .
it is the blessèd sun .
then propn be blessed , it is the blessèd sun .
propn , go thy ways ; the field is won .
well , forward , forward !
thus the bowl should run , and not unluckily against the bias .
but , soft !
company is coming here .
young budding virgin , fair and fresh and sweet , propn away , or where is thy abode ?
happy the parents of so fair a child .
will propn please your propn to wash your hands ?
o , how we joy to see your wit restored !
o , that once more you knew but what you are !
these fifteen years you have been in a dream or , when you waked , so waked as if you slept .
these fifteen years !
by my fay , a goodly nap .
but did i never speak of all that time ?
o , yes , my lord , but very idle words .
why , sir , you know no house nor no such maid , nor no such men as you have reckoned up , as propn propn and old propn propn of propn , and propn propn and propn propn , and twenty more such names and men as these , which never were , nor no man ever saw .
why , how now , propn !
i hope thou art not mad .
this is a man — old , wrinkled , faded , withered— and not a maiden , as thou propn he is .
fair sir , and you , my merry mistress , that with your strange encounter much amazed me , my name is called propn , my dwelling propn , and bound i am to propn , there to visit a son of mine which long i have not seen .
what is his name ?
lucentio , gentle sir .
happily met , the happier for thy son .
the sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , propn son by this hath married .
propn not nor be grieved .
let me embrace with old propn , and wander we to see thy honest son , who will of thy arrival be full joyous .
i do assure thee , father , so it is .
well , propn , this has put me in heart .
softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready .
i fly , propn .
nay , faith , i ’ ll see the church a ' your back , and then come back to my master propn as soon as i can .
i marvel propn comes not all this while .
propn , here ’ s the door .
this is propn ’ s house .
my father ’ s bears more toward the marketplace .
thither must i , and here i leave you , sir .
you shall not choose but drink before you go .
they ’ re busy within .
you were best knock louder .
is propn propn within , sir ?
what if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal ?
hope i may choose , sir .
come hither , you rogue !
what , have you forgot me ?
forgot you !
no , sir .
i could not forget you , for i never saw you before in all my life .
what , my old worshipful old master ?
yes , marry , sir .
see where he looks out of the window .
is propn so , indeed .
help , help , help !
here ’ s a madman will murder me .
oh , i am undone , i am undone !
what , is the man lunatic ?
thy father !
o villain !
he is a sailmaker in propn .
you mistake , sir , you mistake , sir .
pray , what do you think is his name ?
his name !
lucentio !
oh , he hath murdered his master !
o my son , my son !
tell me , thou villain , where is my son lucentio ?
carry this mad knave to the jail .— propn propn , i charge you see that he be forthcoming .
carry me to the jail ?
he shall not go to prison .
talk not , propn propn .
i say he shall go to prison .
take heed , propn propn , lest you be cony - catched in this business .
i dare swear this is the right propn .
nay , i dare not swear it .
yes , i know thee to be propn propn .
away with the dotard !
to the jail with him !
o !
we are spoiled and yonder he is !
propn , sweet father .
lives my sweet son ?
propn , dear father .
how hast thou offended ?
where is lucentio ?
here ’ s lucentio , right son to the right propn , that have by marriage made thy daughter mine while counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne .
here ’ s packing , with a witness , to deceive us all !
where is that damnèd villain , propn , that faced and braved me in this matter so ?
why , tell me , is not this my propn ?
propn is changed into propn .
love wrought these miracles .
propn ’ s love made me exchange my state with propn , while he did bear my countenance in the town , and happily i have arrivèd at the last unto the wishèd haven of my bliss .
what propn did , myself enforced him to .
then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake .
i ’ ll slit the villain ’ s nose that would have sent me to the jail .
but do you hear , sir , have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill ?
fear not , propn , we will content you .
go to .
my cake is dough , but i ’ ll in among the rest , out of hope of all but my share of the feast .
propn , let ’ s follow to see the end of this ado .
first kiss me , propn , and we will .
what , in the midst of the street ?
what , art thou ashamed of me ?
no , sir , propn forbid , but ashamed to kiss .
why , then let ’ s home again .
nay , i will give thee a kiss .
is not this well ?
come , my sweet propn .
better once than never , for never too late .
now propn be thanked for my good amends !
amen .
i thank thee .
thou shalt not lose by it .
how fares my noble lord ?
marry , i fare well , for here is cheer enough .
where is my wife ?
here , noble lord .
what is thy will with her ?
are you my wife and will not call me “ husband ” ?
my men should call me “ lord . ” i am your goodman .
my fair propn , bid my father welcome , while i with selfsame kindness welcome thine .
my banquet is to close our stomachs up , after our great good cheer .
pray you , sit down , for now we sit to chat as well as eat .
nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat !
for both our sakes , i would that word were true .
now , for my life , propn fears his widow .
you are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : i mean , propn is afeard of you .
he that is giddy thinks the world turns round .
roundly replied .
propn , how mean you that ?
thus i conceive by him .
very well mended .
kiss him for that , good widow .
he that is giddy thinks the world turns propn i pray you , tell me what you meant by that .
your husband being troubled with a shrew propn my husband ’ s sorrow by his woe .
and now you know my meaning .
a very mean meaning .
right , i mean you .
to her , widow !
a hundred marks , my propn does put her down .
that ’ s my office .
spoke like an officer !
ha ' to thee , lad !
how likes propn these quick - witted folks ?
believe me , sir , they butt together well .
ay , but not frighted me .
therefore i ’ ll sleep again .
nay , that you shall not .
am i your bird ?
she hath prevented me .
here , propn propn , this bird you aimed at , though you hit her not.— therefore a health to all that shot and missed .
a good swift simile , but something currish .
propn well , sir , that you hunted for yourself .
propn hits you now .
i thank thee for that gird , good propn .
he has a little galled me , i confess .
and , as the jest did glance away from me , ' propn ten to one it maimed you two outright .
now , in good sadness , son propn , i think thou hast the veriest shrew of all .
well , i say no .
content .
what ’ s the wager ?
twenty crowns .
twenty crowns ?
i ’ ll venture so much of my hawk or hound , but twenty times so much upon my wife .
a hundred then .
content .
a match !
propn done .
who shall begin ?
that will i .
go , propn , bid your mistress come to me .
i go .
propn , i ’ ll be your half propn comes .
i ’ ll have no halves .
how !
she ’ s busy , and she can not come ! ” is that an answer ?
ay , and a kind one too .
pray propn , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
i hope better .
now , where ’ s my wife ?
she says you have some goodly jest in hand .
she will not come .
she bids you come to her .
worse and worse .
i know her answer .
what ?
she will not .
now , by my holidam , here comes propn !
what is your will , sir , that you send for me ?
where is your sister , and propn ’ s wife ?
they sit conferring by the parlor fire .
go fetch them hither .
if they deny to come , swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands .
here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .
and so it is .
i wonder what it bodes .
marry , peace it bodes , and love , and quiet life , and awful rule , and right supremacy , and , to be short , what not that ’ s sweet and happy ?
now , fair befall thee , good propn !
the wager thou hast won , and i will add unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , another dowry to another daughter , for she is changed as she had never been .
see where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion.— propn , that cap of yours becomes you not .
off with that bauble , throw it underfoot .
propn , let me never have a cause to sigh , till i be brought to such a silly pass !
fie !
what a foolish duty call you this ?
i would your duty were as foolish too .
the wisdom of your duty , fair propn , propn cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime .
the more fool you for laying on my duty .
we will have no telling .
she shall not .
i say she shall .— and first begin with her .
propn , fie !
propn that threat'ning unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor .
such duty as the subject owes the prince , even such a woman oweth to her husband .
and when she is froward , peevish , sullen , sour , and not obedient to his honest will , what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord ?
i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace ; or seek for rule , supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve , love , and obey .
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , propn to toil and trouble in the world , but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts ?
come , come , you froward and unable worms !
my mind hath been as big as one of yours , my heart as great , my reason haply more , to bandy word for word and frown for frown .
but now i see our lances are but straws , our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , that seeming to be most which we indeed least are .
come on and kiss me , propn .
propn a good hearing when children are toward .
but a harsh hearing when women are froward .
come , propn , we ’ ll to bed .
we three are married , but you two are sped .
propn a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .
propn wife , they say that i have dreamed and slept above some fifteen year or more .
ay , and the time seems thirty unto me , being all this time abandoned from your bed .
propn much .— servants , leave me and her alone .
propn , undress you and come now to bed .
thrice noble lord , let me entreat of you to pardon me yet for a night or two , or if not so , until the sun be set .
for your physicians have expressly charged , in peril to incur your former malady , that i should yet absent me from your bed .
i hope this reason stands for my excuse .
ay , it stands so that i may hardly tarry so long .
but i would be loath to fall into my dreams again .
your propn ’ s players , hearing your amendment , are come to play a pleasant comedy , for so your doctors hold it very meet , seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood , and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy .
therefore they thought it good you hear a play and frame your mind to mirth and merriment , which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life .
let them play it .
what , household stuff ?
it is a kind of history .
well , we ’ ll see propn .
we shall ne'er be younger .
pisa , renownèd for grave citizens , gave me my being and my father first , a merchant of great traffic through the world , propn , come of the propn .
i ’ ll pheeze you , in faith .
a pair of stocks , you rogue !
y'are a baggage , the propn are no rogues .
therefore you will not pay for the glasses you have burst ?
no , not a denier .
go by , propn propn .
go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
i know my remedy .
i ’ ll not budge an inch , boy .
let him come , and kindly .
propn , propn , well dost thou advise .
but stay awhile .
what company is this ?
propn , some show to welcome us to town .
i ' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear .
but if it were , doubt not her care should be to comb your noddle with a three - legged stool and paint your face and use you like a fool .
from all such devils , good propn , deliver us !
and me too , good propn !
propn ’ s mild behavior and sobriety .
sister , content you in my discontent.— propn , to your pleasure humbly i subscribe .
my books and instruments shall be my company , on them to look and practice by myself .
propn , propn !
propn propn , will you be so strange ?
why will you mew her up , propn propn , for this fiend of hell and make her bear the penance of her tongue ?
and for i know she taketh most delight in music , instruments , and poetry , schoolmasters will i keep within my house , fit to instruct her youth .
and so farewell .— propn , you may stay , for i have more to commune with propn .
why , and i trust i may go too , may i not ?
what , shall i be appointed hours as though , belike , i knew not what to take and what to leave , ha ?
you may go to the devil ’ s dam !
propn .
though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now upon advice , it toucheth us both , that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in propn ’ s love , to labor and effect one thing specially .
what ’ s that , i pray ?
marry , sir , to get a husband for her sister .
a husband ?
a devil !
i say a husband .
i say a devil .
think ’ st thou , propn , though her father be very rich , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell ?
propn , propn .
though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums , why , man , there be good fellows in the world , an a man could light on them , would take her with all faults , and money enough .
i can not tell .
how say you , propn propn ?
i am agreed , and would i had given him the best horse inv propn to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her , we d her , and bed her , and rid the house of her !
come on .
i pray , sir , tell me , is it possible that love should of a sudden take such hold ?
o propn , till i found it to be true , i never thought it possible or likely .
affection is not rated from the heart .
if love have touched you , naught remains but so : propn , lad , go forward .
this contents .
the rest will comfort , for thy counsel ’ s sound .
propn , you looked so longly on the maid , perhaps you marked not what ’ s the pith of all .
oh yes , i saw sweet beauty in her face such as the daughter of propn had , that made great propn to humble him to her hand when with his knees he kissed the propn strand .
saw you no more ?
propn , i saw her coral lips to move and with her breath she did perfume the air .
ah , propn , what a cruel father propn he !
but art thou not advised , he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ?
ay , marry , am i , sir ; and now ’ tis plotted !
i have it , propn !
propn , for my hand , both our inventions meet and jump in one .
tell me thine first .
you will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid : that ’ s your device .
it is .
may it be done ?
not possible .
propn hatched , and shall be so .
when propn comes , he waits on thee , but i will charm him first to keep his tongue .
where have i been ?
nay , how now , where are you ?
propn , come hither : ’ tis no time to jest , and therefore frame your manners to the time .
you understand me ?
propn , sir .
and not a jot of “ propn ” in your mouth .
would i were so too .
so could i , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , that propn indeed had propn ’ s youngest daughter .
but , sirrah , not for my sake , but your master propn , i advise you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies .
when i am alone , why then i am propn ; but in all places else , your master propn .
propn , let ’ s go .
one thing more rests , that thyself execute , to make one among these wooers .
if thou ask me why , sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty .
my lord , you nod .
you do not mind the play .
a good matter , surely .
comes there any more of it ?
propn a very excellent piece of work , madam lady .
would ’ twere done .
propn , i charge thee , tender well my hounds .
propn propn , the poor cur is embossed , and couple propn with the deep - mouthed brach .
why , propn is as good as he , my lord .
trust me , i take him for the better dog .
thou art a fool .
if propn were as fleet , i would esteem him worth a dozen such .
but sup them well and look unto them all .
tomorrow i intend to hunt again .
i will , my lord .
what ’ s here ?
one dead , or drunk ?
see , doth he breathe ?
he breathes , my lord .
were he not warmed with ale , this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly .
grim death , how foul and loathsome is thine image !
sirs , i will practice on this drunken man .
propn , for a while i take my leave , to see my friends in propn , but of all my best belovèd and approvèd friend , propn .
and i trow this is his house .
here , propn propn .
propn , i say .
propn , sir ?
whom should i knock ?
is there any man has rebused your worship ?
knock you here , sir ?
propn , i say , knock me at this gate and rap me well , or i ’ ll knock your knave ’ s pate .
my master is grown quarrelsome .
how now , what ’ s the matter ?
my old friend propn and my good friend propn ?
how do you all at propn ?
propn propn , come you to part the fray ?
nay , ’ tis no matter , sir , what he ' leges in propn .
i bade the rascal knock upon your gate and could not get him for my heart to do it .
knock at the gate ?
o heavens !
spake you not these words plain : “ propn , knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly ” ?
and come you now with “ knocking at the gate ” ?
propn , patience .
i am propn ’ s pledge .
why , this ' a heavy chance ’ twixt him and you , your ancient , trusty , pleasant servant propn .
and tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale blows you to propn here from old propn ?
such wind as scatters young men through the world to seek their fortunes farther than at home , where small experience grows .
crowns in my purse i have and goods at home , and so am come abroad to see the world .
thou ’ dst thank me but a little for my counsel ; and yet i ’ ll promise thee she shall be rich , and very rich .
but thou'rt too much my friend , and i ’ ll not wish thee to her .
propn propn , ’ twixt such friends as we few words suffice .
i can , propn , help thee to a wife with wealth enough , and young and beauteous , brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman .
her only fault , and that is faults enough , is that she is intolerable curst , and shrewd and froward , so beyond all measure that , were my state far worser than it is , i would not we d her for a mine of gold .
propn , peace .
thou know ’ st not gold ’ s effect .
her father is propn propn , an affable and courteous gentleman .
her name is propn propn , propn in propn for her scolding tongue .
i know her father , though i know not her , and he knew my deceasèd father well .
i will not sleep , propn , till i see her , and therefore let me be thus bold with you to give you over at this first encounter , unless you will accompany me thither .
propn , propn , i must go with thee , for in propn propn keep my treasure is .
he hath the jewel of my life in hold , his youngest daughter , beautiful propn , and her withholds from me and other more , suitors to her and rivals in my love , supposing it a thing impossible , for those defects i have before rehearsed , that ever propn will be wooed .
propn the curst ! ” a title for a maid of all titles the worst .
now shall my friend propn do me grace , and offer me disguised in sober robes to old propn as a schoolmaster well seen in music , to instruct propn , that so i may , by this device at least , have leave and leisure to make love to her and , unsuspected , court her by herself .
here ’ s no knavery !
propn , master , look about you .
who goes there , ha ?
peace , propn .
it is the rival of my love .
propn , stand by a while .
o this learning , what a thing it is !
and you are well met , propn propn .
trow you whither i am going ?
to propn propn .
propn well .
and i have met a gentleman propn promised me to help me to another , a fine musician to instruct our mistress .
propn , ’ tis now no time to vent our love .
so said , so done , is well .
propn , have you told him all her faults ?
i know she is an irksome brawling scold .
if that be all , masters , i hear no harm .
no ?
say ’ st me so , friend ?
what countryman ?
my father dead , my fortune lives for me .
and i do hope good days and long to see .
o sir , such a life with such a wife were strange !
but if you have a stomach , to propn , i ' propn ’ s name : you shall have me assisting you in all .
but will you woo this wildcat ?
why came i hither but to that intent ?
have i not heard the sea , puffed up with winds , rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat ?
have i not heard great ordnance in the field , and propn ’ s artillery thunder in the skies ?
propn , hark .
and so we will , provided that he win her .
i would i were as sure of a good dinner .
he that has the two fair daughters — is propn he you mean ?
not her that chides , sir , at any hand , i pray .
propn , a word ere you go .
are you a suitor to the maid you talk of , yea or no ?
an if i be , sir , is it any offense ?
no , if without more words you will get you hence .
for this reason , if you ’ ll know : that she ’ s the choice love of propn propn .
that she ’ s the chosen of propn propn .
softly , my masters .
if you be gentlemen , do me this right : hear me with patience .
propn is a noble gentleman , to whom my father is not all unknown , and were his daughter fairer than she is , she may more suitors have , and me for one .
believe me , lord , i think he can not choose .
it would seem strange unto him when he waked .
even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy .
then take him up and manage well the jest .
carry him gently to my fairest chamber and hang it round with all my wanton pictures .
propn his foul head in warm distilled waters and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet .
my lord , i warrant you we will play our part as he shall think by our true diligence he is no less than what we say he is .
propn propn ’ s daughter had a thousand wooers ; then well one more may fair propn have .
this gentleman will out - talk us all .
propn , to what end are all these words ?
yea , leave that labor to great propn , and let it be more than alcides ' twelve .
propn , you say well , and well you do conceive .
o excellent motion !
fellows , let ’ s be gone .
the motion ’ s good indeed and be it so.— propn , i shall be your
good sister , wrong me not nor wrong yourself , to make a bondmaid and a slave of me .
that i disdain .
see thou dissemble not .
minion , thou liest .
is propn not propn ?
oh , then belike you fancy riches more .
you will have propn to keep you fair .
is it for him you do envy me so ?
what , in my sight ? — propn , get thee in .
what , will you not suffer me ?
talk not to me .
but who comes here ?
good morrow , neighbor propn .
good morrow , neighbor propn .— propn save you , gentlemen !
and you , good sir .
pray , have you not a daughter called propn , fair and virtuous ?
i have a daughter , sir , called propn .
you wrong me , propn propn .
give me leave.— i am a gentleman of propn , sir , that hearing of her beauty and her wit , her affability and bashful modesty , her wondrous qualities and mild behavior , am bold to show myself a forward guest within your house , to make mine eye the witness of that report which i so oft have heard .
you ’ re welcome , sir , and he for your good sake .
but for my daughter propn , this i know , she is not for your turn , the more my grief .
i see you do not mean to part with her , or else you like not of my company .
mistake me not .
i speak but as i find .
whence are you , sir ?
what may i call your name ?
propn is my name , propn ’ s son , a man well known throughout all propn .
i know him well .
you are welcome for his sake .
oh , pardon me , propn propn , i would fain be doing .
i doubt it not , sir , but you will curse your wooing.— propn , this is a gift very grateful , i am sure of it .
to express the like kindness , myself , that have been more kindly beholding to you than any , freely give unto you this young scholar
a thousand thanks , propn propn .
welcome , good propn .
propn is your name .
of whence , i pray ?
a mighty man of propn .
by report i know him well .
you are very welcome , sir .
we will go walk a little in the orchard , and then to dinner .
you are passing welcome , and so i pray you all to think yourselves .
propn propn , my business asketh haste , and every day i can not come to woo .
you knew my father well , and in him me , left solely heir to all his lands and goods , which i have bettered rather than decreased .
then tell me , if i get your daughter ’ s love , what dowry shall i have with her to wife ?
after my death , the one half of my lands , and , in possession , twenty thousand crowns .
let specialties be therefore drawn between us , that covenants may be kept on either hand .
ay , when the special thing is well obtained , that is , her love , for that is all in all .
why , that is nothing .
for i tell you , father , i am as peremptory as she proud - minded ; and where two raging fires meet together , they do consume the thing that feeds their fury .
so i to her and so she yields to me , for i am rough and woo not like a babe .
well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed .
but be thou armed for some unhappy words .
ay , to the proof , as mountains are for winds , that shakes not , though they blow perpetually .
how now , my friend , why dost thou look so pale ?
what , will my daughter prove a good musician ?
i think she ’ ll sooner prove a soldier .
why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ?
i ’ ll fume with them ! ” and with that word she struck me on the head , and through the instrument my pate made way ,
now , by the world , it is a lusty wench .
i love her ten times more than e'er i did .
oh , how i long to have some chat with her !
i pray you do .
i ’ ll attend her here and woo her with some spirit when she comes .
say that she rail ; why then i ’ ll tell her plain she sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
say that she frown ; i ’ ll say she looks as clear as morning roses newly washed with dew .
say she be mute and will not speak a word ; then i ’ ll commend her volubility , and say she uttereth piercing eloquence .
if she do bid me pack , i ’ ll give her thanks , as though she bid me stay by her a week .
if she deny to we d , i ’ ll crave the day when i shall ask the banns and when be marrièd .
take him up gently , and to bed with him , and each one to his office when he wakes .
propn , go see what trumpet ’ tis that sounds .
propn some noble gentleman that means , traveling some journey , to repose him here .
propn please your honor , players that offer service to your lordship .
bid them come near .
now , fellows , you are welcome .
we thank your honor .
do you intend to stay with me tonight ?
so please your lordship to accept our duty .
with all my heart .
this fellow i remember since once he played a farmer ’ s eldest son .
twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well .
i have forgot your name , but sure that part was aptly fitted and naturally performed .
good morrow , propn — for that ’ s your name , i hear .
well have you heard , but something hard of hearing .
moved , ” in good time .
i knew you at the first you were a moveable .
why , what ’ s a moveable ?
a joint stool .
thou hast hit it .
come , sit on me .
asses are made to bear , and so are you .
women are made to bear , and so are you .
no such jade as you , if me you mean .
alas , good propn , i will not burden thee , for knowing thee to be but young and light— too light for such a swain as you to catch , and yet as heavy as my weight should be .
should be ” —should buzz !
if i be waspish , best beware my sting .
my remedy is then to pluck it out .
ay , if the fool could find it where it lies .
who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ?
in his tail .
in his tongue .
whose tongue ?
yours , if you talk of tales .
what , with my tongue in your tail ?
nay , come again , propn propn .
that i ’ ll try .
i swear i ’ ll cuff you if you strike again .
so may you lose your arms .
no cock of mine .
nay , come , propn , come .
you must not look so sour .
it is my fashion , when i see a crab .
why , here ’ s no crab , and therefore look not sour .
there is , there is .
then show it me .
had i a glass , i would .
what , you mean my face ?
well aimed of such a young one .
now , by propn propn , i am too young for you .
yet you are withered .
propn with cares .
i care not .
let me go .
no , not a whit .
i find you passing gentle .
twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen , and now i find report a very liar .
thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , nor bite the lip as angry wenches will , nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk .
but thou with mildness propn thy wooers , with gentle conference , soft and affable .
why does the world report that propn doth limp ?
o slanderous world !
propn like the hazel - twig is straight and slender and as brown in hue as hazel nuts , and sweeter than the kernels .
oh , let me see thee walk !
did ever propn so become a grove as propn this chamber with her princely gait ?
a witty mother !
propn else her son .
am i not wise ?
for i am he am born to tame you , propn , and bring you from a wild propn to a propn propn as other household propn .
i should know that voice .
it should be — but he is drowned , and these are devils .
oh , defend me !
four legs and two voices — a most delicate monster .
his forward voice now is to speak well of his friend .
his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract .
if all the wine in my bottle will recover him , i will help his ague .
come .
stephano !
doth thy other mouth call me ?
mercy , mercy !
this is a devil , and no monster .
i will leave him .
i have no long spoon .
stephano !
if thou beest propn , touch me and speak to me .
for i am trinculo — be not afeard — thy good friend propn .
if thou beest trinculo , come forth .
i ’ ll pull thee by the lesser legs .
if any be propn ’ s legs , these are they .
but art thou not drowned , propn ?
i hope now thou art not drowned .
is the storm overblown ?
i hid me under the dead mooncalf ’ s gaberdine for fear of the storm .
and art thou living , propn ?
o propn , two propn ’ scaped !
prithee , do not turn me about .
my stomach is not constant .
propn ashore , man , like a duck .
i can swim like a duck , i ’ ll be sworn .
here , kiss the book .
o propn , hast any more of this ?
the whole butt , man .
propn thou not dropped from propn ?
out o ' th ' moon , i do assure thee .
i was the man i ' the moon when time was .
my mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush .
i afeard of him !
a very weak monster .
the man i ' th ' moon !
a most poor credulous monster .— well drawn , monster , in good sooth !
by this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster .
when propn god ’ s asleep , he ’ ll rob his bottle .
come on then .
down , and swear .
i shall laugh myself to death at this puppy - headed monster .
a most scurvy monster .
i could find in my heart to beat him— but that the poor monster propn in drink .
an abominable monster !
i ’ ll show thee the best springs .
i ’ ll pluck thee berries .
i ’ ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough .
a plague upon the tyrant that i serve !
a most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard .
i prithee now , lead the way without any more talking.— propn , the king and all our company else being drowned , we will inherit here .— here , bear my bottle .— propn propn , we ’ ll fill him by and by again .
a howling monster , a drunken monster .
o brave monster !
lead the way .
now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground : long heath , brown furze , anything .
some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone .
and most poor matters propn to rich ends .
this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious , but the mistress which i serve quickens what ’ s dead and makes my labors pleasures .
oh , she is ten times more gentle than her father ’ s crabbed , and he ’ s composed of harshness .
i must remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up , upon a sore injunction .
my sweet mistress propn when she sees me work , and says such baseness had never like executor .
i forget , but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors , most busiest when i do it .
propn now , pray you , work not so hard .
i would the lightning had burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile !
pray , set it down and rest you .
when this burns , ' propn weep for having wearied you .
my father is hard at study .
pray now , rest yourself .
he ’ s safe for these three hours .
o most dear mistress , the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do .
if you ’ ll sit down , i ’ ll bear your logs the while .
pray , give me that .
i ’ ll carry it to the pile .
it would become me as well as it does you , and i should do it with much more ease , for my good will is to it and yours it is against .
you look wearily .
i do beseech you— propn that i might set it in my prayers— what is your name ?
miranda .— o my father , i have broke your hest to say so !
full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time
for several virtues have i liked several women .
but you , o you , so perfect and so peerless , are created of every creature ’ s best .
i do not know one of my sex , no woman ’ s face remember— propn , from my glass , mine own .
nor have i seen more that i may call men than you , good friend , and my dear father .
i am in my condition a prince , propn — i do think , a king ; i would , not so ! —and would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the flesh - fly blow my mouth .
hear my soul speak .
the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service , there resides to make me slave to it , and for your sake am i this patient log - man .
do you love me ?
o propn , o earth , bear witness to this sound and crown what i profess with kind event
if i speak true !
i beyond all limit of what else i ' th ' world do love , prize , honor you .
i am a fool to weep at what i am glad of .
wherefore weep you ?
at mine unworthiness , that dare not offer what i desire to give , and much less take what i shall die to want .
but this is trifling , and all the more it seeks to hide itself the bigger bulk it shows .
i am your wife if you will marry me .
if not , i ’ ll die your maid .
to be your fellow you may deny me , but i ’ ll be your servant whether you will or no .
my mistress , dearest , and i thus humble ever .
my husband , then ?
a thousand thousand !
i ’ ll to my book , for yet ere supper - time must i perform much business appertaining .
tell not me .
when the butt is out , we will drink water .
not a drop before .
therefore bear up and board ' em .— propn monster , drink to me .
servant - monster ” ?
the folly of this island .
they say there ’ s but five upon this isle .
we are three of them .
if th ' other two be brained like us , the state totters .
drink , servant - monster , when i bid thee .
propn eyes are almost set in thy head .
where should they be set else ?
he were a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail .
for my part , the sea can not drown me .
he ’ s no standard .
we ’ ll not run , propn propn .
nor go neither .
but you ’ ll lie like dogs , and yet say nothing neither .
mooncalf , speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good mooncalf .
how does thy honor ?
let me lick thy shoe .
propn , ” quoth he ?
that a monster should be such a natural !
trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head .
if you prove a mutineer , the next tree .
i thank my noble lord .
wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit i made to thee ?
i will stand , and so shall propn .
thou liest .
trinculo , if you trouble him any more in ’ s tale , by this hand , i will supplant some of your teeth .
why , i said nothing .
propn , then , and no more .
proceed .
i say , by sorcery he got this isle .
from me he got it .
if thy greatness will revenge it on him — for i know thou darest , but this thing dare not— that ’ s most certain .
thou shalt be lord of it and i ’ ll serve thee .
how now shall this be compassed ?
propn thou bring me to th ' party ?
propn , yea , my lord .
i ’ ll yield him thee asleep , where thou mayst knock a nail into his head .
thou liest .
thou canst not .
what a pied ninny ’ s this ! —thou scurvy patch ! — i do beseech thy greatness , give him blows and take his bottle from him .
when that ’ s gone , he shall drink naught but brine , for i ’ ll not show him where the quick freshes are .
trinculo , run into no further danger .
interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , i ’ ll turn my mercy out o ' doors and make a stockfish of thee .
why , what did i ?
i did nothing .
i ’ ll go farther off .
propn thou not say he lied ?
thou liest .
i did not give the lie .
out o ' your wits and hearing too ?
a pox o ' your bottle !
ha , ha , ha !
now , forward with your tale .— prithee , stand farther off .
beat him enough .
after a little time , i ’ ll beat him too .
why , as i told thee , ’ tis a custom with him , i ' th ' afternoon to sleep .
there thou mayst brain him , having first seized his books ; or with a log propn his skull ; or paunch him with a stake ; or cut his weasand with thy knife .
remember first to possess his books , for without them he ’ s but a sot , as i am , nor hath not one spirit to command .
they all do hate him as rootedly as i .
burn but his books .
he has brave utensils — for so he calls them— propn when he has a house , he ’ ll deck withal .
and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter .
he himself calls her a nonpareil .
i never saw a woman , but only propn my dam and she .
but she as far surpasseth propn as propn does least .
is it so brave a lass ?
ay , lord .
monster , i will kill this man .
his daughter and i will be king and queen — save our propn propn and thyself shall be viceroys .— dost thou like the plot , propn ?
excellent .
give me thy hand .
i am sorry i beat thee .
but while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head .
within this half hour will he be asleep .
wilt thou destroy him then ?
if by your art , my dearest father , you have put the wild waters in this roar , allay them .
the sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , but that the sea , mounting to th ' welkin ’ s cheek , dashes the fire out .
oh , i have suffered with those that i saw suffer .
a brave vessel who had , no doubt , some noble creature in her dashed all to pieces .
oh , the cry did knock against my very heart !
poor souls , they perished .
had i been any god of power , i would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallowed and the fraughting souls within her .
be collected .
no more amazement .
tell your piteous heart there ’ s no harm done .
oh , woe the day !
no harm .
more to know did never meddle with my thoughts .
ay , on mine honor .
thou makest me merry .
i am full of pleasure .
let us be jocund .
at thy request , monster , i will do reason , any reason.— come on , propn , let us sing .
that ’ s not the tune .
what is this same ?
o , forgive me my sins !
art thou afeard ?
no , monster , not i .
be not afeard .
this will prove a brave kingdom to me , where i shall have my music for nothing .
when prospero is destroyed .
that shall be by and by .
i remember the story .
the sound is going away .
let ’ s follow it , and after do our work .
lead , monster ; we ’ ll follow .
i would i could see this taborer .
he lays it on .
wilt come ?
my old bones ache .
here ’ s a maze trod indeed through forthrights and meanders .
by your patience , i needs must rest me .
old lord , i can not blame thee , who am myself attached with weariness to th ' dulling of my spirits .
sit down and rest .
he is drowned whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks our frustrate search on land .
well , let him go .
what harmony is this ?
my good friends , hark !
marvelous sweet music !
give us kind keepers , heavens !
what were these ?
now i will believe that there are unicorns , that in propn there is one tree , the phoenix ' throne , one phoenix at this hour reigning there .
travelers ne'er did lie , propn fools at home condemn 'em .
if in propn i should report this now , would they believe me ?
if i should say , i saw such islanders— for , certes , these are people of the island— who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet note , their manners are more gentle - kind than of our human generation you shall find many — nay , almost any .
they vanished strangely .
no matter , since they have left their viands behind , for we have stomachs .
will propn please you taste of what is here ?
not i .
faith , sir , you need not fear .
brother , my lord the duke , stand to and do as we .
oh , it is monstrous , monstrous .
methought the billows spoke and told me of it , the winds did sing it to me , and the thunder , that deep and dreadful organ pipe , pronounced the name of propn .
it did bass my trespass .
therefore my son i ' th ' ooze is bedded , and i ’ ll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded and with him there lie mudded .
but one fiend at a time , i ’ ll fight their legions o'er .
i ’ ll be thy second .
all three of them are desperate .
their great guilt , like poison given to work a great time after , now ' gins to bite the spirits .
i do beseech you that are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly and hinder them from what this ecstasy may now provoke them to .
follow , i pray you .
but if thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be ministered , no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow , but barren hate , propn - eyed disdain , and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both .
fairly spoke .
sit then and talk with her .
she is thine own.— what , propn !
my industrious servant , propn !
what would my potent master ?
here i am .
thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform , and i must use you in such another trick .
go bring the rabble , propn whom i give thee power , here to this place .
it is my promise , and they expect it from me .
presently ?
ay , with a twink .
before you can say “ come ” and “ go , ” and breathe twice and cry “ so , so ! ” each one , tripping on his toe ,
propn time i should inform thee farther .
lend thy hand and pluck my magic garment from me .
not yet . ” the hour ’ s now come .
propn thou remember a time before we came unto this cell ?
i do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not out three years old .
certainly , sir , i can .
by what ?
by any other house or person ?
of anything the image tell me that propn kept with thy remembrance .
dearly my delicate propn .
do not approach propn thou dost hear me call .
well , i conceive .
i warrant you , sir , the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardor of my liver .
propn now come , my propn !
bring a corollary , rather than want a spirit .
appear and pertly ! — no tongue .
all eyes !
be silent .
ceres , most bounteous lady , thy rich leas of wheat , rye , barley , vetches , oats , and peas ; propn turfy mountains , where live nibbling sheep , and flat meads thatched with stover , them to keep ; thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims ,
why hath thy queen summoned me hither to this short - grassed green ?
a contract of true love to celebrate , and some donation freely to estate on the blessed lovers .
tell me , heavenly bow , if propn or her son , as thou dost know , do now attend the queen ?
since they did plot the means that dusky propn my daughter got , her and her blind boy ’ s scandaled company i have forsworn .
of her society be not afraid .
i met her deity cutting the clouds towards propn , and her son dove - drawn with her .
here thought they to have done some wanton charm upon this man and maid , whose vows are that no bed - right shall be paid till propn ’ s torch be lighted — but in vain .
propn ’ s hot minion is returned again .
her waspish - headed son has broke his arrows , propn he will shoot no more , but play with sparrows and be a boy right out .
highest queen of state , propn propn , comes .
i know her by her gait .
how does my bounteous sister ?
go with me to bless this twain that they may prosperous be , and honored in their issue .
this is a most majestic vision , and harmonious charmingly .
may i be bold to think these spirits ?
spirits , which by mine art i have from their confines called to enact my present fancies .
let me live here ever .
so rare a wondered father and a wife makes this place propn .
propn now , silence .
propn and propn whisper seriously .
there ’ s something else to do .
hush and be mute , or else our spell is marred .
come , temperate nymphs , and help to celebrate a contract of true love .
be not too late .
you sunburnt sicklemen of propn weary , come hither from the furrow and be merry .
your rye - straw hats put on , and these fresh nymphs encounter every one in country footing .
the minute of their plot is almost come .— well done .
never till this day saw i him touched with anger so distempered .
we are such stuff as dreams are made on , and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
propn , i am vexed .
bear with my weakness .
my old brain is troubled .
be not disturbed with my infirmity .
if you be pleased , retire into my cell and there repose .
a turn or two i ’ ll walk to still my beating mind .
we wish your peace .
come with a thought .
i thank thee , propn .
come .
thy thoughts i cleave to .
what ’ s thy pleasure ?
propn , we must prepare to meet with propn .
ay , my commander .
when i presented propn , i thought to have told thee of it , but i feared lest i might anger thee .
say again , where didst thou leave these varlets ?
i told you , sir , they were red - hot with drinking , so full of valor that they smote the air for breathing in their faces , beat the ground for kissing of their feet — yet always bending towards their project .
then i beat my tabor , at which , like unbacked colts , they pricked their ears , advanced their eyelids , lifted up their noses as they smelt music .
so i charmed their ears that , calflike , they my lowing followed through toothed briers , sharp furzes , pricking gorse , and thorns , which entered their frail shins .
at last i left them i ' th ' filthy - mantled pool beyond your cell , there dancing up to th ' chins , that the foul lake o'erstunk their feet .
this was well done , my bird .
thy shape invisible retain thou still .
the trumpery in my house , go bring it hither for stale to catch these thieves .
i go , i go .
a devil , a born devil on whose nature nurture can never stick , on whom my pains , humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost .
and as with age his body uglier grows , so his mind cankers .
i will plague them all , even to roaring .
come , hang them on this line .
pray you , tread softly , that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall .
we now are near his cell .
monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the jack with us .
monster , i do smell all horse piss , at which my nose is in great indignation .
so is mine .— do you hear , monster ?
if i should take a displeasure against you , look you— propn wert but a lost monster .
good my lord , give me thy favor still .
be patient , for the prize i ’ ll bring thee to shall hoodwink this mischance .
therefore speak softly .
all propn hushed as midnight yet .
that ’ s more to me than my wetting .
yet this is your harmless fairy , monster .
prithee , my king , be quiet .
propn thou here , this is the mouth o ' th ' cell .
no noise , and enter .
do that good mischief which may make this island propn own for ever , and i , thy propn , for aye thy foot - licker .
give me thy hand .
i do begin to have bloody thoughts .
let it alone , thou fool .
it is but trash .
oh , ho , monster , we know what belongs to a frippery.— put off that gown , propn .
by this hand , i ’ ll have that gown .
thy grace shall have it .
the dropsy drown this fool !
what do you mean to dote thus on such luggage ?
let ’ s alone , and do the murder first .
if he awake , from toe to crown he ’ ll fill our skins with pinches , make us strange stuff .
do , do .
i thank thee for that jest .
propn shall not go unrewarded while i am king of this country .
there ’ s another garment for propn .
monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest .
i will have none on propn .
monster , lay to your fingers .
help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or i ’ ll turn you out of my kingdom .
go to , carry this .
and this .
ay , and this .
hey , propn , hey !
silver .
there it goes , silver !
propn far off , and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants .
had i not four or five women once that tended me ?
thou hadst , and more , propn .
but how is it that this lives in thy mind ?
if thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here , how thou camest here thou mayst .
but that i do not .
twelve year since , propn , twelve year since , propn father was the propn of propn and a prince of power .
propn , are not you my father ?
propn mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter .
and thy father was propn of propn , and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued .
oh , the heavens !
what foul play had we that we came from thence ?
or blessè was propn we did ?
both , both , my girl .
by foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , but blessedly holp hither .
fury , fury ! —there , propn , there .
propn , hark !
go charge my goblins that they grind their joints with dry convulsions , shorten up their sinews with agèd cramps , and more pinch - spotted make them than pard or cat o ' mountain .
propn , they roar .
let them be hunted soundly .
at this hour lie at my mercy all mine enemies .
shortly shall all my labors end , and thou propn have the air at freedom .
for a little propn , and do me service .
now does my project gather to a head .
my charms crack not , my spirits obey , and time goes upright with his carriage .
how ’ s the day ?
on the sixth hour , at which time , my lord , you said our work should cease .
i did say so when first i raised the tempest .
say , my spirit , how fares the king and ’ s followers ?
confined together in the same fashion as you gave in charge , just as you left them , all prisoners , sir , in the line grove which weather - fends your cell .
they can not budge till your release .
the king , his brother , and yours , abide all three distracted , and the remainder mourning over them , brimful of sorrow and dismay .
but chiefly him that you termed , sir , “ the good old propn propn , ” his tears run down his beard like winter ’ s drops from eaves of reeds .
your charm so strongly works 'em that if you now beheld them , your affections would become tender .
dost thou think so , spirit ?
mine would , sir , were i human .
and mine shall .
the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance .
go release them , propn .
my charms i ’ ll break , their senses i ’ ll restore , and they shall be themselves .
i ’ ll fetch them , sir .
with his own bolt ; the strong - based promontory have i made shake , and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar ; graves at my command have waked their sleepers , oped , and let 'em forth by my so potent art .
but this rough magic i here abjure , and when i have required some heavenly music , which even now i do , to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for , i ’ ll break my staff , propn it certain fathoms in the earth , and deeper than did ever plummet sound i ’ ll drown my book .
a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains , now useless , boiled within thy skull .— there stand , for you are spell - propn propn eyes , ev'n sociable to the show of thine , fall fellowly drops .
why , that ’ s my dainty propn .
i shall miss thee , but yet thou shalt have freedom .— so , so , so.— to the king ’ s ship , invisible as thou art .
all torment , trouble , wonder , and amazement inhabits here .
this must crave— propn if this be at all — a most strange story .
thy dukedom i resign and do entreat propn pardon me my wrongs .
but how should prospero be living and be here ?
whether this be or be not , i ’ ll not swear .
welcome , my friends all .
the devil speaks in him .
you the like loss ?
as great to me as late .
and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you , for i have lost my daughter .
a daughter ?
o heavens , that they were living both in propn , the king and queen there !
that they were , i wish myself were mudded in that oozy bed where my son lies .— when did you lose your daughter ?
in this last tempest .
i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth , their words are natural breath .— but howsoev'r you have been justled from your senses , know for certain that i am propn and that very duke which was thrust forth of propn , who most strangely upon this shore where you were wracked , was landed , to be the lord on propn .
no , my dearest love , i would not for the world .
if this prove a vision of the propn , one dear son propn i twice lose .
a most high miracle !
now all the blessings of a glad father , compass thee about .
arise , and say how thou camest here .
oh , wonder !
how many goodly creatures are there here !
how beauteous mankind is !
o brave new world , that has such people in propn !
propn new to thee .
propn , she is mortal .
but by immortal providence , she ’ s mine .
i chose her when i could not ask my father for his advice , nor thought i had one .
she is daughter to this famous propn of propn , of whom so often i have heard renown but never saw before , of whom i have received a second life .
and second father this lady makes him to me .
i am hers .
but oh , how oddly will it sound that i must ask my child forgiveness !
there , sir , stop .
let us not burden our remembrances with a heaviness that ’ s gone .
oh , my heart bleeds to think o ' th ' teen that i have turned you to , which is from my remembrance !
please you , farther .
my brother and thy uncle , called propn i pray thee , mark me ( that a brother should be so perfidious !
he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state , as at that time through all the signories it was the first , and propn the prime duke , being so reputed in dignity , and for the liberal arts without a parallel .
those being all my study , the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger , being transported and rapt in secret studies .
thy false uncle— dost thou attend me ?
propn , most heedfully .
o , good sir , i do .
look down , you gods , and on this couple drop a blessèd crown , for it is you that have chalked forth the way which brought us hither .
i say amen , propn .
was propn thrust from propn , that his issue should become kings of propn ?
o , rejoice beyond a common joy , and set it down with gold on lasting pillars .
in one voyage did propn her husband find at propn ; and propn , her brother , found a wife where he himself was lost ; prospero , his dukedom in a poor isle ; and all of us , ourselves when no man was his own .
be it so .
amen .
oh , look , sir , look , sir !
here is more of us .
the best news is that we have safely found our king and company .
the next , our ship— which , but three glasses since , we gave out split— is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when we first put out to sea .
these are not natural events .
on a trice , so please you , even in a dream were we divided from them and were brought moping hither .
this is as strange a maze as e'er men trod , and there is in this business more than nature was ever conduct of .
some oracle must rectify our knowledge .
propn , my liege , do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business .
how fares my gracious sir ?
propn , bully - monster , if these be true spies which i wear in my head , here ’ s a goodly sight .
o propn , these be brave spirits indeed !
how fine my master is !
i am afraid he will chastise me .
ha , ha !
what things are these , my lord antonio ?
will money buy 'em ?
i shall be pinched to death .
is not this propn , my drunken butler ?
he is drunk now .
where had he wine ?
and propn is reeling ripe .
why , how now , propn ?
o , touch me not .
i am not propn , but a cramp .
you ’ d be king o ' th ' isle , sirrah ?
i should have been a sore one then .
he is as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape.— take with you your companions .
and i ’ ll be wise hereafter and seek for grace .
what a thrice - double ass was i , to take this drunkard for a god and worship this dull fool !
go to , away .
or stole it , rather .
and in the morn i ’ ll bring you to your ship and so to propn , where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our dear - belovèd solemnized , and thence retire me to my propn , where every third thought shall be my grave .
i long to hear the story of your life , which must take the ear strangely .
now my charms are all o'erthrown , and what strength i have ’ s mine own , which is most faint .
let me not , since i have my dukedom got and pardoned the deceiver , dwell in this bare island by your spell , but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands .
as you from crimes would pardoned be , let your indulgence set me free .
i pray thee , mark me .
i , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which , but by being so retired , o'erprized all popular rate , in my false brother awaked an evil nature .
and my trust , like a good parent , did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was , which had indeed no limit , a confidence sans bound .
hence his ambition growing— dost thou hear ?
your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
me , poor man , my library was dukedom large enough .
oh , the heavens !
mark his condition and the event .
then tell me if this might be a brother .
i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother .
the propn of propn , being an enemy to me inveterate , hearkens my brother ’ s suit , which was that he , in lieu o ' th ' premises of homage and i know not how much tribute , should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom , and confer fair propn with all the honors on my brother .
propn , for pity !
i , not remembering how i cried out then , will cry it o'er again .
it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to propn .
hear a little further and then i ’ ll bring thee to the present business which now ’ s upon propn , without the which this story were most impertinent .
propn did they not that hour destroy us ?
well demanded , wench .
my tale provokes that question .
dear , they durst not , so dear the love my people bore me , nor set a mark so bloody on the business , but with colors fairer painted their foul ends .
propn , what trouble was i then to you !
oh , a cherubim propn wast that did preserve me .
thou didst smile propn with a fortitude from propn , when i have decked the sea with drops full salt , under my burthen groaned ; which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue .
how came we ashore ?
by providence divine .
some food we had and some fresh water that a noble propn , propn , out of his charity , who being then appointed propn of this design , did give us , with propn garments , linens , stuffs , and necessaries , which since have steaded much .
so , of his gentleness , propn i loved my books , he furnished me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom .
would i might but ever see that man !
now i arise .
heavens thank you for propn !
and now , i pray you , sir— for still ’ tis beating in my mind — your reason for raising this sea storm ?
know thus far forth : by accident most strange , bountiful propn ( now my dear lady ) hath mine enemies brought to this shore .
here cease more questions .
propn a good dullness , and give it way .
i know thou canst not choose .
come away , servant , come .
i am ready now .
approach , my propn , come .
all hail , great master !
grave sir , hail !
propn thou , spirit , propn to point the tempest that i bade thee ?
sometime i ’ d divide , and burn in many places .
jove ’ s lightning , the precursors o ' th ' dreadful thunderclaps , more momentary and sight - outrunning were not .
my brave spirit !
propn !
here , master .
what cheer ?
good , speak to th ' mariners .
fall to propn yarely , or we run ourselves aground .
where propn the propn ?
play the men .
i pray now , keep below .
where is the propn , propn ?
not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and played some tricks of desperation .
all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , then all afire with me .
the king ’ s son , propn , with hair up - staring — then , like reeds , not hair— was the first man that leaped , cried , “ hell is empty and all the devils are here . ” why , that ’ s my spirit !
but was not this nigh shore ?
close by , my master .
but are they , propn , safe ?
not a hair perished .
on their sustaining garments not a blemish , but fresher than before .
and , as thou badest me , in troops i have dispersed them 'bout the isle .
the king ’ s son have i landed by himself , whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle , and sitting , his arms in this sad knot .
of the king ’ s ship , the mariners , say how thou hast disposed , and all the rest o ' th ' fleet .
the mariners all under hatches stowed , who , with a charm joined to their suffered labor , i have left asleep .
and for the rest o ' th ' fleet , which i dispersed , they all have met again and are upon the propn float , propn sadly home for propn , supposing that they saw the king ’ s ship wracked and his great person perish .
propn , thy charge exactly is performed .
but there ’ s more work .
what is the time o ' th ' day ?
past the mid season .
at least two glasses .
the time propn six and now must by us both be spent most preciously .
is there more toil ?
since thou dost give me pains , let me remember thee what thou hast promised , which is not yet performed me .
how now ?
moody ?
what is propn thou canst demand ?
my liberty .
before the time be out ?
no more !
i prithee , remember i have done thee worthy service , told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served without or grudge or grumblings .
thou didst promise to bate me a full year .
dost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee ?
no .
thou dost , and think ’ st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep , to run upon the sharp wind of the north , to do me business in the veins o ' th ' earth when it is baked with frost .
i do not , sir .
thou liest , malignant thing !
propn thou forgot the foul witch propn , who with age and envy was grown into a hoop ?
propn thou forgot her ?
no , sir .
thou hast .
where was she born ?
speak .
tell me .
propn , in propn .
oh , was she so ?
i must once in a month recount what thou hast been , which thou forget ’ st .
this damned witch propn , for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing , from propn , propn know ’ st , was banished .
for one thing she did they would not take her life .
is not this true ?
ay , sir .
this blue - eyed hag was hither brought with child and here was left by th ' sailors .
thou , my slave , as thou report ’ st thyself , wast then her servant .
and , for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorred commands , refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage , into a cloven pine , within which rift propn thou didst painfully remain a dozen years ; within which space she died and left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike .
dull thing , i say so .
he , that propn propn now i keep in service .
it was mine art , when i arrived and heard thee , that made gape the pine and let thee out .
i thank thee , master .
if thou more murmur ’ st , i will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till propn hast howled away twelve winters .
propn , master .
i will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently .
do so , and after two days i will discharge thee .
that ’ s my noble master !
what shall i do ?
say , what ?
what shall i do ?
go make thyself like a nymph o ' th ' sea .
be subject to no sight but thine and mine , invisible to every eyeball else .
go take this shape and hither come in propn .
go hence with diligence .
shake it off .
come on .
we ’ ll visit propn , my slave who never yields us kind answer .
but as ’ tis , we can not miss him .
he does make our fire , fetch in our wood , and serves in offices that profit us .— what , ho !
propn !
caliban !
speak .
come forth , i say !
there ’ s other business for thee .
come , thou tortoise !
fine apparition !
my quaint propn , propn in thine ear .
my lord it shall be done .
as wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed with raven ’ s feather from unwholesome fen propn on you both !
a southwest blow on ye and blister you all o'er !
for this , be sure , tonight thou shalt have cramps , side - stitches that shall pen thy breath up .
propn propn , forth at vast of night that they may work , all exercise on thee .
thou shalt be pinched as thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging than bees that made 'em .
i must eat my dinner .
this island ’ s mine , by propn my mother , which thou takest from me .
cursed be i that did so !
thou most lying slave , propn stripes may move , not kindness !
i have used thee , propn as thou art , with human care , and lodged thee in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate the honor of my child .
oh ho , oh ho !
would propn had been done !
thou didst prevent me .
abhorrèd slave , which any print of goodness wilt not take , being capable of all ill !
i pitied thee , propn pains to make thee speak , taught thee each hour one thing or other .
but thy vile race , propn thou didst learn , had that in propn which good natures could not abide to be with .
therefore wast thou deservedly confined into this rock , who hadst deserved more than a prison .
you taught me language , and my profit on propn is i know how to curse .
the red plague rid you for learning me your language !
no , pray thee .
so , slave , hence !
the watchdogs bark .
propn , hark !
i hear the strain of strutting chanticleer propn “ propn - a - diddle - dow . ” where should this music be ?
i ' th ' air or th ' earth ?
it sounds no more , and sure , it waits upon some god o ' th ' island .
sitting on a bank , weeping again the king my father ’ s wrack , this music crept by me upon the waters , allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air .
propn i have followed it , or it hath drawn me rather .
but ’ tis gone .
no , it begins again .
propn , now i hear them .
the ditty does remember my drowned father .
i hear it now above me .
what is propn ?
a spirit ?
propn , how it looks about !
believe me , sir , it carries a brave form .
but propn a spirit .
no , wench !
it eats and sleeps and hath such senses as we have , such .
he hath lost his fellows and strays about to find 'em .
do you not hear him ?
you mar our labor .
keep your cabins .
you do assist the storm .
nay , good , be patient .
hence !
to cabin , silence !
trouble us not .
good , yet remember whom thou hast aboard .
none that i more love than myself .
you are a councilor .
use your authority .
if you can not , give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour , if it so hap .— cheerly , good hearts ! —out of our way , i say .
i have great comfort from this fellow .
i might call him a thing divine , for nothing natural i ever saw so noble .
no wonder , sir , but certainly a maid .
my language !
propn , i am the best of them that speak this speech , were i but where ’ tis spoken .
how ?
the best ?
what wert thou if the propn of propn heard thee ?
a single thing , as i am now , that wonders to hear thee speak of propn .
he does hear me , and that he does i weep .
myself am propn , who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld the king my father wracked .
propn , for mercy !
yes , faith , and all his lords , the propn of propn and his brave son being twain .
soft , sir !
one word more .
if the ill spirit have so fair a house , good things will strive to dwell with propn .
what , i say ?
come from thy ward , for i can here disarm thee with this stick and make thy weapon drop .
beseech you , father .
hence !
hang not on my garments .
propn , have pity , i ’ ll be his surety .
silence !
one word more shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee .
what , an advocate for an imposter ?
propn , propn think ’ st there is no more such shapes as he , having seen but him and propn .
foolish wench , to th ' most of men this is a propn and they to him are angels .
my affections are then most humble .
i have no ambition to see a goodlier man .
so they are .
my spirits , as in a dream , are all bound up .
my father ’ s loss , the weakness which i feel , the wrack of all my friends , nor this man ’ s threats , to whom i am subdued , are but light to me , propn i but through my prison once a day propn this maid .
space enough have i in such a prison .
prithee , peace .
a dollar .
propn comes to him , indeed .
you have spoken truer than you purposed .
you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should .
well , i have done .
but propn which , of he or propn , for a good wager , first begins to crow ?
the old cock .
the cockerel .
done .
the wager ?
a laughter .
a match !
though this island seem to be desert—
it must needs be of subtle , tender , and delicate temperance .
temperance was a delicate wench .
ay , and a subtle , as he most learnedly delivered .
the air breathes upon us here most sweetly .
or as propn perfumed by a fen .
here is everything advantageous to life .
true .
save means to live .
of that there ’ s none , or little .
how lush and lusty the grass looks !
how green !
the ground indeed is tawny .
with an eye of green in propn .
he misses not much .
no , he doth but mistake the truth totally .
but the rarity of it is — which is indeed almost beyond credit— as many vouched rarities are .
that our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the sea , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses , being rather new - dyed than stained with salt water .
ay , or very falsely pocket up his report .
methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in propn , at the marriage of the king ’ s fair daughter propn to the propn of propn .
twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
propn was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen .
propn propn ” said you ?
you make me study of that .
she was of propn , not of propn .
carthage ?
i assure you , propn .
his word is more than the miraculous harp .
what impossible matter will he make easy next ?
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
and sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .
ay .
why , in good time .
down with the topmast !
propn , lower , lower !
bring her to try wi ' th ' main course .
a plague upon this howling !
they are louder than the weather or our office .
yet again ?
what do you here ?
shall we give o'er and drown ?
have you a mind to sink ?
i ’ ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
lay her a - hold , a - hold !
all lost !
to prayers , to prayers , all lost !
and the rarest that e'er came there .
bate , i beseech you , widow propn .
oh , widow dido ?
ay , widow propn .
is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it ?
i mean , in a sort .
that “ sort ” was well fished for .
when i wore it at your daughter ’ s marriage ?
you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense .
propn , he may live .
i not doubt he came alive to land .
no , no , he ’ s gone .
prithee , peace .
you were kneeled to and importuned otherwise by all of us , and the fair soul herself weighed between loathness and obedience , at which end o ' th ' beam should bow .
we have lost your son , i fear , forever .
propn and propn have more widows in them of this business ' making than we bring men to comfort them .
the fault ’ s your own .
so is the dearest o ' th ' loss .
my lord propn , the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in .
you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster .
very well .
and most chirurgeonly .
foul weather ?
very foul .
had i plantation of this isle , my lord— he ’ d sow propn with nettle seed .
or docks , or mallows .
and were the king on propn , what would i do ?
propn being drunk for want of wine .
for no kind of traffic would i admit .
no occupation .
no sovereignty— yet he would be king on propn .
all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavor .
but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison , all abundance , to feed my innocent people .
no marrying ’ mong his subjects ?
none , man .
prithee , no more .
thou dost talk nothing to me .
twas you we laughed at .
what a blow was there given !
an it had not fallen flat - long .
you are gentlemen of brave mettle .
you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .
we would so , and then go a - batfowling .
no , i warrant you .
go sleep , and hear us .
what , all so soon asleep ?
i wish mine eyes would with themselves shut up my thoughts .
please you , sir , do not omit the heavy offer of it .
it seldom visits sorrow .
we two , my lord , will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety .
thank you .
wondrous heavy .
what a strange drowsiness possesses them !
it is the quality o ' th ' climate .
why propn it not then our eyelids sink ?
i find not myself disposed to sleep .
nor i .
my spirits are nimble .
they fell together all , as by consent .
th ' occasion speaks thee , and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head .
what , art thou waking ?
do you not hear me speak ?
i do , and surely it is a sleepy language , and thou speak ’ st out of thy sleep .
what is it thou didst say ?
thou dost snore distinctly .
there ’ s meaning in thy snores .
i ’ ll teach you how to flow .
do so .
oh , if you but knew how you the purpose cherish propn thus you mock it !
how , in stripping it , you more invest it !
ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth .
prithee , say on .
i have no hope that he ’ s undrowned .
oh , out of that “ no hope ” what great hope have you !
no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even propn can not pierce a wink beyond , but doubt discovery there .
will you grant with me that propn is drowned ?
he ’ s gone .
then , tell me , who ’ s the next heir of propn ?
propn .
propn true , my brother ’ s daughter propn propn of propn , so is she heir of propn , propn which regions there is some space .
i myself could make a chough of as deep chat .
oh , that you bore the mind that i do , what a sleep were this for your advancement !
methinks i do .
and how does your content tender your own good fortune ?
i remember you did supplant your brother prospero .
my brother ’ s servants were then my fellows .
now they are my men .
but , for your conscience ?
ay , sir .
but i feel not this deity in my bosom .
should not upbraid our course .
for all the rest , they ’ ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk .
they ’ ll tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour .
propn case , dear friend , shall be my precedent .
as thou propn propn , i ’ ll come by propn .
draw thy sword .
one stroke shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest .
and i the king shall love thee .
draw together .
and when i rear my hand , do you the like , to fall it on propn .
o , but one word .
what , must our mouths be cold ?
the king and prince at prayers .
i ’ m out of patience .
he ’ ll be hanged yet , though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him .
let ’ s all sink wi ' th ' king .
let ’ s take leave of him .
then let us both be sudden .
why are you drawn ?
wherefore this ghastly looking ?
what ’ s the matter ?
propn we stood here securing your repose , even now , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing like bulls , or rather lions .
did propn not wake you ?
it struck mine ear most terribly .
i heard nothing .
oh , ’ twas a din to fright a monster ’ s ear , to make an earthquake !
sure , it was the roar of a whole herd of lions .
heard you this , propn ?
upon mine honor , sir , i heard a humming , and that a strange one too , which did awake me .
i shaked you , sir , and cried .
as mine eyes opened , i saw their weapons drawn .
there was a noise , that ’ s verily .
let ’ s draw our weapons .
heavens keep him from these beasts !
for he is , sure , i ' th ' island .
lead away .
his spirits hear me and yet i needs must curse .
but they ’ ll nor pinch , fright me with urchin - shows , pitch me i ' th ' mire , nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark out of my way , unless he bid 'em .
sometime am i all wound with adders who with cloven tongues do hiss me into madness .
propn , now , lo !
perchance he will not mind me .
here ’ s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all .
and another storm brewing , i hear it sing i ' th ' wind .
yond same black cloud , yond huge one , looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor .
a strange fish !
were i in propn now , as once i was , and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver .
there would this monster make a man .
any strange beast there makes a man .
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten to see a dead indian .
legged like a man and his fins like arms !
warm , o ' my troth .
i do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
alas , the storm is come again !
my best way is to creep under his gaberdine .
there is no other shelter hereabouts .
misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows .
i will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
this is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man ’ s funeral .
well , here ’ s my comfort .
do not torment me .
oh !
what ’ s the matter ?
have we devils here ?
do you put tricks upon propn with savages and men of propn , ha ?
i have not ’ scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs .
the spirit torments me .
oh !
this is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got , as i take it , an ague .
where the devil should he learn our language ?
i will give him some relief if it be but for that .
if i can recover him and keep him tame and get to propn with him , he ’ s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat ’ s leather .
do not torment me , prithee .
i ’ ll bring my wood home faster .
he ’ s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest .
he shall taste of my bottle .
if he have never drunk wine afore , it will go near to remove his fit .
if i can recover him and keep him tame , i will not take too much for him .
he shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly .
lie thou there ( throwing down a letter ) , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
propn once told me she did affect me , and i have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion .
besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
what should i think on propn ?
to be propn propn !
the lady of the propn married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
i frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my — some rich jewel .
lips , do not move ; no man must know . ”
no man must know . ” what follows ?
no man must know . ” if this should be thee , propn ?
i may command where i adore , but silence , like a propn knife , with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore ; propn
doth sway my life . ” nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
i may command where i adore . ” why , she may command me .
why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
there is no obstruction in this .
if i could make that resemble something in me — softly !
there is a fair behavior in thee , captain , and though that nature with a beauteous wall propn oft close in pollution , yet of thee i will believe thou hast a mind that suits with this thy fair and outward character .
i prithee — and i ’ ll pay thee bounteously— conceal me what i am , and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent .
i ’ ll serve this duke .
thou shall present me as an eunuch to him .
it may be worth thy pains , for i can sing and speak to him in many sorts of music that will allow me very worth his service .
be you his eunuch , and your mute i ’ ll be .
when my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
i thank thee .
lead me on .
m ” —malvolio .
propn , that begins my name .
propn ” this simulation is not as the former , and yet to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name .
soft , here follows prose .
if this fall into thy hand , revolve .
in my stars i am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness .
some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .
propn propn open their hands .
let thy blood and spirit embrace them .
and , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
i say , remember .
propn .
she that would alter services with thee , the propn propn ” propn and champaign discovers not more .
this is open .
i will be proud , i will read politic authors , i will baffle propn propn , i will wash off gross acquaintance , i will be point- devise the very man .
i do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
she did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross - gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
i thank my stars i am happy .
i will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross - gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on .
jove and my stars be praised !
here is yet a postscript .
thou canst not choose but know who i am .
if thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling .
thy smiles become thee well .
therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , i prithee . ”
jove , i thank thee !
i will do everything that thou wilt have me .
i will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the propn .
i could marry this wench for this device .
so could i too .
and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
nor i neither .
here comes my noble gull - catcher .
propn thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
or o ' mine either ?
shall i play my freedom at tray - trip , and become thy bondslave ?
i ' faith , or i either ?
why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
like aqua vitae with a midwife .
if you will see it , follow me .
to the gates of propn , thou most excellent devil of wit !
i ’ ll make one too .
save thee , friend , and thy music .
dost thou live by thy tabour ?
no , sir , i live by the church .
art thou a churchman ?
so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
you have said , sir .
how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward !
nay , that ’ s certain .
i would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
why , man ?
why , sir , her name ’ s a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
thy reason , man ?
propn , sir , i can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , i am loath to prove reason with them .
i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
not so , sir , i do care for something .
but in my conscience , sir , i do not care for you .
if that be to care for nothing , sir , i would it would make you invisible .
art not thou the propn propn ’ s fool ?
no , indeed , sir ; the propn propn has no folly .
i saw thee late at the propn propn propn .
it shines everywhere .
i would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : i think i saw your wisdom there .
hold , there ’ s expenses for thee .
now jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard !
to fool ) is thy lady within ?
yes , being kept together and put to use .
my lady is within , sir .
i will construe to them whence you come .
who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , i might say “ element , ” but the word is overworn .
this fellow is wise enough to play the fool , and to do that well craves a kind of wit .
this is a practise as full of labor as a wise man ’ s art , for folly that he wisely shows is fit .
save you , gentleman .
and you , sir .
i am bound to your niece , sir .
i mean , she is the list of my voyage .
taste your legs , sir .
put them to motion .
i mean , to go , sir , to enter .
i will answer you with gait and entrance .
but we are prevented .
most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !
my matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
em all three all ready .
let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
give me your hand , sir .
my duty , madam , and most humble service .
what is your name ?
cesario is your servant ’ s name , fair princess .
my servant , sir !
twas never merry world since lowly feigning was call ’ d compliment .
for him , i think not on him .
for his thoughts , would they were blanks , rather than fill ’ d with me .
propn , i come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf .
o , by your leave , i pray you , i bade you never speak again of him .
dear lady— give me leave , beseech you .
i did send , after the last enchantment you did here , a ring in chase of you .
what might you think ?
what a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
by my troth , propn propn , you must come in earlier o ' nights .
your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
why , let her except , before excepted .
i ’ ll confine myself no finer than i am .
these clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too .
an they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
who , propn propn propn ?
ay , he .
he ’ s as tall a man as any propn in propn .
have you not set mine honor at the stake , and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts that tyrannous heart can think ?
to one of your receiving propn is shown .
so , let me hear you speak .
i pity you .
that ’ s a degree to love .
no , not a grize .
if one should be a prey , how much the better to fall before the lion than the wolf !
there lies your way , due west .
stay , i prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
that you do think you are not what you are .
if i think so , i think the same of you .
i would you were as i would have you be !
would it be better , madam , than i am ?
i wish it might , for now i am your fool .
and so adieu , good madam .
no , faith , i ’ ll not stay a jot longer .
thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
you must needs yield your reason , propn propn .
marry , i saw your niece do more favors to the propn ’ s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me .
i saw propn i ' the orchard .
did she see thee the while , old boy ?
tell me that .
as plain as i see you now .
this was a great argument of love in her toward you .
slight , will you make an ass o ' me ?
i will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
and they have been grand - jurymen since before propn was a sailor .
she did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
you should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire - new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
this was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
an propn be any way , it must be with valor , for policy i hate .
i had as lief be a propn as a politician .
why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .
challenge me the count ’ s youth to fight with him .
hurt him in eleven places .
my niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love - broker in the world can more prevail in man ’ s commendation with woman than report of valor .
there is no way but this , propn propn .
will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
go , write it in a martial hand .
be curst and brief .
it is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
go .
this is a dear manikin to you , propn propn .
i have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
we shall have a rare letter from him : but you ’ ll not deliver propn ?
never trust me , then .
and by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
i think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
if you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
he ’ s in yellow stockings .
and cross - gartered ?
most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i ' the church .
he does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the propn .
you have not seen such a thing as ’ tis .
i can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
i know my lady will strike him .
if she do , he ’ ll smile and take propn for a great favor .
come , bring us , bring us where he is .
i could not stay behind you .
my kind propn , i can no other answer make but thanks , and thanks , and ever thanks .
what ’ s to do ?
shall we go see the relics of this town ?
propn you slew great number of his people ?
it might have since been answered in repaying what we took from them , which , for traffic ’ s sake , most of our city did .
only myself stood out ; for which , if i be lapsèd in this place , i shall pay dear .
do not then walk too open .
it doth not fit me .
hold , sir , here ’ s my purse .
haply your eye shall light upon some toy you have desire to purchase , and your store , i think , is not for idle markets , sir .
i ’ ll be your purse - bearer and leave you for an hour .
to the propn .
i do remember .
i have sent after him .
he says he ’ ll come .
for youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow ’ d .
i speak too loud.— where ’ s propn ?
he is sad and civil and suits well for a servant with my fortunes .
where is propn ?
he ’ s coming , madam ; but in very strange manner .
he is sure possessed , madam .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
does he rave ?
no , madam , he does nothing but smile .
your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in ’ s wits .
go call him hither .
i am as mad as he , if sad and merry madness equal be .
how now , propn ?
sweet lady , ho , ho .
why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
he ’ s a very fool and a prodigal .
propn , that you ’ ll say so !
by this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .
who are they ?
they that add , moreover , he ’ s drunk nightly in your company .
with drinking healths to my niece .
i ’ ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in propn .
he ’ s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o ' th ' toe like a parish top .
propn propn propn !
how now , propn propn propn !
propn propn propn !
propn thou ?
i sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
sad , lady !
i could be sad .
this does make some obstruction in the blood , this cross - gartering , but what of that ?
if it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , “ please one , and please all . ” why , how dost thou , man ?
what is the matter with thee ?
not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
it did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed .
i think we do know the sweet roman hand .
wilt thou go to bed , propn ?
to bed ?
how do you , propn ?
at your request !
yes , nightingales answer daws !
why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?
be not afraid of greatness . ” ' twas well writ .
what meanest thou by that , propn ?
some are born great— ”
ha ?
some achieve greatness— ” what sayest thou ?
and some have greatness thrust upon them . ” propn restore thee !
remember who commended thy yellow stockings— ” propn yellow stockings ?
and wished to see thee cross - gartered . ” cross - gartered ?
go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so— ” am i made ?
propn , the young gentleman of the propn propn ’ s is returned .
i ’ ll come to him .
good propn , let this fellow be looked to .
where ’ s my cousin propn ?
let some of my people have a special care of him .
i would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
oh , ho !
do you come near me now ?
this concurs directly with the letter .
cast thy humble slough , ” says she .
i have limed her , but it is propn propn doing , and jove make me thankful !
and when she went away now , “ let this fellow be looked to . ” “ propn ! ” not “ propn , ” nor after my degree , but “ fellow . ” why , everything adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance — what can be said ?
nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
well , jove , not i , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
if all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and propn himself possessed him , yet i ’ ll speak to him .
here he is , here he is .
how is ’ t with you , sir ?
go off , i discard you .
let me enjoy my private .
go off .
aha !
does she so ?
do you know what you say ?
marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if i live .
my lady would not lose him for more than i ’ ll say .
how now , mistress ?
o propn !
no way but gentleness , gently , gently .
the fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
propn !
ay , propn , come with me .— what , man !
propn not for gravity to play at cherry - pit with propn .
hang him , foul collier !
get him to say his prayers , good propn propn , get him to pray .
my prayers , minx ?
go , hang yourselves all !
you are idle , shallow things .
i am not of your element .
you shall know more hereafter .
is ’ t possible ?
if this were played upon a stage now , i could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
his very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
why , we shall make him mad indeed .
the house will be the quieter .
come , we ’ ll have him in a dark room and bound .
my niece is already in the belief that he ’ s mad .
more matter for a propn morning .
is propn so saucy ?
ay , is propn , i warrant him .
do but read .
give me .
a good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
very brief , and to exceeding good sense — less .
good .
still you keep o ' the windy side of the law .
good .
propn propn ”
if this letter move him not , his legs can not .
i ’ ll give propn him .
you may have very fit occasion for propn .
he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
go , propn propn .
scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum - baily .
away !
nay , let me alone for swearing .
his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth .
he will find it comes from a clodpole .
but , sir , i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon propn a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as i know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
here he comes with your niece .
give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
with the same ' havior that your passion bears goes on my master ’ s grief .
here , wear this jewel for me .
propn my picture .
refuse it not .
it hath no tongue to vex you .
and i beseech you come again tomorrow .
what shall you ask of me that i ’ ll deny , that honor , saved , may upon asking give ?
nothing but this : your true love for my master .
how with mine honor may i give him that which i have given to you ?
i will acquit you .
well , come again tomorrow .
fare thee well .
a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
propn , propn save thee .
and you , sir .
that defense thou hast , betake thee to propn .
of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , i know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
you mistake , sir .
i am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
you ’ ll find it otherwise , i assure you .
i pray you , sir , what is he ?
he is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
propn , nob , is his word .
and you too , sir .
accost , propn propn , accost .
what ’ s that ?
propn propn propn , i desire better acquaintance .
my name is propn , sir .
by my troth , i would not undertake her in this company .
is that the meaning of “ accost ” ?
an thou let part so , propn propn , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
an you part so , mistress , i would i might never draw sword again .
fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
propn , i have not you by the hand .
i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
i am no fighter .
i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
propn this is a man of that quirk .
propn , no .
his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .
therefore get you on and give him his desire .
back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
this is as uncivil as strange .
i beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
it is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
i will do so .
propn propn , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
pray you , sir , do you know of this matter ?
i beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
he is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of propn .
will you walk towards him ?
i will make your peace with him if i can .
i shall be much bound to you for propn .
why , man , he ’ s a very devil .
i have not seen such a firago .
i had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck - in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable .
and on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
they say he has been fencer to the propn .
pox on propn !
i ’ ll not meddle with him .
ay , but he will not now be pacified .
propn can scarce hold him yonder .
plague on propn , an i thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , i ’ d have seen him damned ere i ’ d have challenged him .
let him let the matter slip , and i ’ ll give him my horse , gray propn .
i ’ ll make the motion .
stand here , make a good show on propn .
this shall end without the perdition of souls .
i ’ ll ride your horse as well as i ride you .
he is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
come , propn propn , there ’ s no remedy .
the gentleman will , for his honor ’ s sake , have one bout with you .
he can not by the duello avoid it .
but he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you .
come on , to propn .
pray propn , he keep his oath !
i do assure you , ’ tis against my will .
put up your sword .
if this young gentleman have done offence , i take the fault on me .
if you offend him , i for him defy you .
you , sir ?
why , what are you ?
one , sir , that for his love dares yet do more than you have heard him brag to you he will .
nay , if you be an undertaker , i am for you .
o good propn propn , hold !
here come the officers .
marry , will i , sir .
and for that i promised you , i ’ ll be as good as my word .
he will bear you easily and reins well .
this is the man .
do thy office .
antonio , i arrest thee at the suit of propn propn .
you do mistake me , sir .
no , sir , no jot .
i know your favor well , though now you have no sea - cap on your head.— take him away .
he knows i know him well .
i must obey .
you stand amazed , but be of comfort .
come , sir , away .
what money , sir ?
i ’ ll make division of my present with you .
hold , there ’ s half my coffer .
will you deny me now ?
i hate ingratitude more in a man than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , or any taint of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood— o heavens themselves !
come , sir , i pray you , go .
let me speak a little .
away !
but oh , how vile an idol proves this god !
none can be called deformed but the unkind .
virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil .
the man grows mad .
away with him .
lead me on .
methinks his words do from such passion fly , that he believes himself .
so do not i .
prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , that i , dear brother , be now ta'en for you !
come hither , knight .
come hither , propn .
we ’ ll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
he named propn .
still in this fashion , color , ornament , for him i imitate .
oh , if it prove , tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love !
a very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
his dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him .
and for his cowardship , ask propn .
a coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
slid , i ’ ll after him again and beat him .
an i do not— come , let ’ s see the event .
i dare lay any money ’ twill be nothing yet .
let me be clear of thee .
well held out , i ' faith .
no , i do not know you , nor i am not sent to you by my lady , to bid you come speak with her , nor your name is not propn propn , nor this is not my nose neither .
nothing that is so is so .
i prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else .
thou know ’ st not me .
vent my folly ?
he has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
vent my folly !
i am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney .
i prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what i shall vent to my lady .
shall i vent to her that thou art coming ?
i prithee , foolish propn , depart from me .
there ’ s money for thee .
by my troth , thou hast an open hand .
these wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report — after fourteen years ' purchase .
hold , sir , or i ’ ll throw your dagger o'er the house .
nay , let him alone .
i ’ ll go another way to work with him .
i ’ ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in propn .
though i struck him first , yet it ’ s no matter for that .
come , sir , i will not let you go .
come , my young soldier , put up your iron .
you are well fleshed .
come on .
i will be free from thee .
what wouldst thou now ?
if thou darest tempt me further , draw thy sword .
what , what ?
nay , then i must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you .
hold , propn !
on thy life i charge thee , hold !
propn !
will it be ever thus ?
out of my sight ! — be not offended , dear propn propn , be gone !
thou shalt not choose but go .
do not deny .
beshrew his soul for me !
he started one poor heart of mine in thee .
wherefore , sweetheart ?
why , i think so .
i am not such an ass , but i can keep my hand dry .
but what ’ s your jest ?
a dry jest , sir .
are you full of them ?
marry , now i let go your hand , i am barren .
o knight , thou lackest a cup of canary .
when did i see thee so put down ?
never in your life , i think , unless you see canary put me down .
methinks sometimes i have no more wit than a propn or an ordinary man has .
if it be thus to dream , still let me sleep !
nay , come , i prithee .
would thou ’ dst be ruled by me !
propn , i will .
oh , say so , and so be !
nay , i prithee , put on this gown and this beard .
make him believe thou art propn propn the curate .
do it quickly .
i ’ ll call propn propn the whilst .
the competitors enter .
jove bless thee , master propn .
bonos dies , propn propn .
to him , propn propn .
the knave counterfeits well .
a good knave .
propn propn , propn propn , good propn propn , go to my lady— out , hyperbolical fiend !
how vexest thou this man !
propn thou nothing but of ladies ?
propn , thou dishonest propn !
i call thee by the most modest terms , for i am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy .
propn thou that house is dark ?
as hell , propn propn .
why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south - north are as lustrous as ebony .
and yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
i am not mad , propn propn .
i say to you this house is dark .
propn , thou errest .
i say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the propn in their fog .
i say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell .
i am no more mad than you are .
make the trial of it in any constant question .
what is the opinion of propn concerning wildfowl ?
that the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
what thinkest thou of his opinion ?
i think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
fare thee well .
remain thou still in darkness .
thou shalt hold the opinion of propn ere i will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
fare thee well .
propn propn , propn propn !
my most exquisite propn propn !
nay , i am for all waters .
thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
he sees thee not .
to him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
i would we were well rid of this knavery .
if he may be conveniently delivered , i would he were , for i am now so far in offense with my niece that i can not pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot .
come by and by to my chamber .
fool !
fool !
fool , i say !
good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper .
as i am a gentleman , i will live to be thankful to thee for propn .
propn propn ?
ay , good fool .
but as well ?
then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
propn propn !
fool , fool , fool , i say !
alas , sir , be patient .
what say you sir ?
good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
i tell thee , i am as well in my wits as any man in propn .
well - a - day that you were , sir .
by this hand , i am .
good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what i will set down to my lady .
it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
i will help you to propn .
but tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?
or do you but counterfeit ?
believe me , i am not .
i tell thee true .
nay , i ’ ll ne'er believe a madman till i see his brains .
i will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
fool , i ’ ll requite it in the highest degree .
i prithee , be gone .
this is the air , that is the glorious sun .
where ’ s propn , then ?
i could not find him at the propn .
yet there he was , and there i found this credit , that he did range the town to seek me out .
his counsel now might do me golden service .
there ’ s something in propn that is deceivable .
but here the lady comes .
i ’ ll follow this good man , and go with you ; and , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
then lead the way , good father ; and heavens so shine that they may fairly note this act of mine .
now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
propn propn propn , grant me another request .
anything .
do not desire to see this letter .
belong you to the propn propn , friends ?
ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
i know thee well .
how dost thou , my good fellow ?
truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
the better for thy friends .
no , sir , the worse .
how can that be ?
i ’ ll ride home tomorrow , propn propn .
then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
why , would that have mended my hair ?
past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
but it becomes me well enough , does propn not ?
excellent .
it hangs like flax on a distaff .
faith , i ’ ll home tomorrow , propn propn .
the count himself here hard by woos her .
i have heard her swear propn .
propn , there ’ s life in propn , man .
marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly i am an ass .
so that by my foes , sir i profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , i am abused .
so that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
why , this is excellent .
by my troth , sir , no — though it please you to be one of my friends .
thou shalt not be the worse for me : there ’ s gold .
but that it would be double - dealing , sir , i would you could make it another .
o , you give me ill counsel .
well , i will be so much a sinner , to be a double - dealer .
there ’ s another .
propn , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all .
the triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of propn propn , sir , may put you in mind — one , two , three .
you can fool no more money out of me at this throw .
if you will let your lady know i am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till i come again .
i go , sir , but i would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
but , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , i will awake it anon .
here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
that face of his i do remember well .
yet , when i saw it last , it was besmeared as black as propn in the smoke of war .
a baubling vessel was he captain of , for shallow draught and bulk unprizable , with which such scathful grapple did he make with the most noble bottom of our fleet , that very envy and the tongue of loss propn fame and honor on him .— what ’ s the matter ?
orsino , this is that propn that took the and this is he that did the when your young nephew propn lost his leg .
he did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , but in conclusion put strange speech upon me .
i know not what ’ twas but distraction .
notable pirate !
orsino , noble sir , be pleased that i shake off these names you give me .
antonio never yet was thief or pirate , propn , i confess , on base and ground enough , propn ’ s enemy .
that most ingrateful boy there by your side from the rude sea ’ s enraged and foamy mouth did i redeem .
a wreck past hope he was .
his life i gave him and did thereto add my love , without retention or restraint , all his in dedication .
how can this be ?
here comes the propn .
now propn walks on earth .
what would my lord , but that he may not have , propn propn may seem serviceable ?
cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
propn ?
propn propn what do you say , propn ? — propn my lord— my lord would speak .
my duty hushes me .
still so cruel ?
still so constant , lord .
what , to perverseness ?
you , uncivil lady , to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars my soul the faithfull ’ st off'rings have breathed out that e'er devotion tendered — what shall i do ?
even what it please my lord that shall become him .
come , boy , with me .
and i , most jocund , apt , and willingly , to do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
where goes propn ?
ay me , detested !
who does beguile you ?
who does do you wrong ?
propn thou forgot thyself ?
is it so propn propn forth the holy father .
come , away !
propn , my lord ? — cesario , husband , stay .
husband ?
ay , husband .
can he that deny ?
her husband , sirrah ?
no , my lord , not propn alas , it is the baseness of thy fear that makes thee strangle thy propriety .
fear not , propn .
be that thou know ’ st thou art , and then thou art as great as that thou fear ’ st .
o , welcome , father !
propn , i charge thee , by thy reverence , here to unfold ( though lately we intended to keep in darkness what occasion now reveals before ’ tis ripe ) what thou dost know propn newly passed between this youth and me .
my lord , i do protest— o , do not swear !
hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
for the love of propn , a surgeon !
send one presently to propn propn .
what ’ s the matter ?
he has broke my head across and has given propn propn a bloody coxcomb too .
for the love of propn , your help !
i had rather than forty pound i were at home .
who has done this , propn propn ?
the propn ’ s gentleman , one cesario .
we took him for a coward , but he ’ s the very devil incardinate .
my gentleman , propn ?
propn ’ s lifelings , here he is ! —you broke my head for nothing , and that that i did , i was set on to do propn by propn propn .
why do you speak to me ?
i never hurt you .
if a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me .
i think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
here comes propn propn halting .
you shall hear more .
but if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
how now , gentleman ?
how is propn with you ?
that ’ s all one : has hurt me , and there ’ s the end on propn .
propn oh , he ’ s drunk , propn propn , an hour agone .
his eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
then he ’ s a rogue , and a passy - measures pavin .
i hate a drunken rogue .
away with him !
who hath made this havoc with them ?
i ’ ll help you , propn propn , because we ’ ll be dressed together .
will you help ? — an ass - head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin - faced knave , a gull !
get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows we made each other but so late ago .
one face , one voice , one habit , and two persons !
antonio , o my dear antonio !
how have the hours racked and tortured me since i have lost thee !
propn are you ?
propn thou that , propn ?
how have you made division of yourself ?
an apple , cleft in two , is not more twin than these two creatures .
which is sebastian ?
most wonderful !
propn was my father ; such a propn was my brother too , so went he suited to his watery tomb .
a spirit i am indeed , but am in that dimension grossly clad which from the womb i did participate .
were you a woman , as the rest goes even , i should my tears let fall upon your cheek and say “ propn - propn , drownèd propn ! ” my father had a mole upon his brow .
and so had mine .
and died that day when propn from her birth had numbered thirteen years .
i ’ ll stay a month longer .
i am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
i delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
wherefore are these things hid ?
wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
are they like to take dust , like propn propn ’ s picture ?
why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto ?
i would not so much as make water but in a sink - a - pace .
what dost thou mean ?
is it a world to hide virtues in ?
i did think , by the excellent constitution of thy leg , it was formed under the star of a galliard .
ay , ’ tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun - colored stock .
what shall we do else ?
were we not born under propn ?
oh , that record is lively in my soul !
he finished indeed his mortal act that day that made my sister thirteen years .
give me thy hand , and let me see thee in thy woman ’ s weeds .
the captain that did bring me first on shore propn my maid ’ s garments .
he , upon some action , is now in durance at propn ’ s suit , a gentleman and follower of my lady ’ s .
he shall enlarge him .
a most extracting frenzy of mine own from my remembrance clearly banished his .
truly , madam , he holds propn at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
has here writ a letter to you .
i should have given propn you today morning , but as a madman ’ s epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
open propn , and read it .
look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
how now ?
art thou mad ?
no , madam , i do but read madness .
an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow propn , read i ' thy right wits .
so i do , madonna .
but to read his right wits is to read thus .
therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
by the propn , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it .
though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as your propn .
think of me as you please .
i leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
the madly used propn . ” did he write this ?
ay , madam .
this savors not much of distraction .
see him delivered , propn ; bring him hither .
propn , i am most apt to embrace your offer .
is this the madman ?
ay , my lord , this same .
how now , propn !
propn , you have done me wrong , notorious wrong .
have i , propn ?
no .
tell me why .
alas , propn , this is not my writing , propn , i confess , much like the character .
but out of question , propn propn ’ s hand .
and now i do bethink me , it was she first told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , and in such forms which here were presupposed upon thee in the letter .
prithee , be content .
why , “ some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them . ” i was one , sir , in this interlude , one propn propn , sir , but that ’ s all one .
he hath been most notoriously abused .
pursue him and entreat him to a peace .
he hath not told us of the captain yet .
cesario , come , for so you shall be , while you are a man .
propn !
that ’ s sides and heart .
no , sir , it is legs and thighs .
let me see the caper .
he hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
no , believe me .
i thank you .
here comes the count .
who saw propn , ho ?
be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , rather than make unprofited return .
i think not so , my lord .
dear lad , believe it .
for they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man .
i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair .
i ’ ll do my best to woo your lady— whoe'er i woo , myself would be his wife .
give me excess of it that , surfeiting , the appetite may sicken , and so die .
oh , it came propn my ear like the sweet sound , that breathes upon a bank of violets , stealing and giving odor .
propn not so sweet now as it was before .
so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical .
will you go hunt , my lord ?
what , propn ?
my lady will hang thee for thy absence .
let her hang me .
make that good .
he shall see none to fear .
a good lenten answer .
i can tell thee where that saying was born , of “ i fear no colors . ” where , good propn propn ?
in the wars .
well , propn give them wisdom that have it .
yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
you are resolute , then ?
well , go thy way .
if propn propn would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of propn ’ s flesh as any in propn .
peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
here comes my lady .
take the fool away .
do you not hear , fellows ?
take away the lady .
go to , you ’ re a dry fool .
i ’ ll no more of you .
besides , you grow dishonest .
if he can not , let the botcher mend him .
anything that ’ s mended is but patched .
virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
if that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
if it will not , what remedy ?
propn , i bade them take away you .
good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
can you do it ?
dexterously , good madonna .
i must catechise you for it , madonna .
good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
well , sir , for want of other idleness , i ’ ll bide your proof .
good madonna , why mournest thou ?
good fool , for my brother ’ s death .
i think his soul is in hell , madonna .
i know his soul is in propn , fool .
the more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother ’ s soul being in propn .
take away the fool , gentlemen .
what think you of this fool , propn ?
doth he not mend ?
yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him .
infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
propn send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
propn propn will be sworn that i am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
how say you to that , propn ?
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal .
i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
i protest i take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
oh , you are sick of self - love , propn , and taste with a distempered appetite .
now propn endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
propn , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
from the propn propn , is it ?
i know not , madam .
propn a fair young man , and well attended .
who of my people hold him in delay ?
propn propn , madam , your kinsman .
he speaks nothing but madman .
if it be a suit from the count , i am sick , or not at home .
what is he at the gate , cousin ?
a gentleman .
a gentleman ?
what gentleman ?
propn propn propn !
propn !
i defy lechery .
there ’ s one at the gate .
ay , marry , what is he ?
let him be the devil , an he will , i care not .
give me faith , say i .
what ’ s a drunken man like , fool ?
like a drowned man , a fool and a madman .
one draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
go look after him .
propn , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you .
i told him you were sick .
he takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
i told him you were asleep .
he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
what is to be said to him , lady ?
he ’ s fortified against any denial .
tell him he shall not speak with me .
what manner of man ?
of very ill manner .
he ’ ll speak with you , will you or no .
of what personage and years is he ?
not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before ’ tis a peascod , or a codling when ’ tis almost an apple .
propn with him in standing water , between boy and man .
he is very well - favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
one would think his mother ’ s milk were scarce out of him .
let him approach .
call in my gentlewoman .
propn , my lady calls .
give me my veil .
come , throw it o'er my face .
the honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
speak to me .
i shall answer for her .
your will ?
most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty — i pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for i never saw her .
i would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , i have taken great pains to con it .
good beauties , let me sustain no scorn .
i am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
whence came you , sir ?
i can say little more than i have studied , and that question ’ s out of my part .
good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that i may proceed in my speech .
are you a comedian ?
no , my profound heart .
and yet , by the very fangs of malice i swear , i am not that i play .
are you the lady of the house ?
if i do not usurp myself , i am .
most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .
but this is from my commission .
i will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
come to what is important in propn .
i forgive you the praise .
alas , i took great pains to study it , and ’ tis poetical .
it is the more like to be feigned .
i pray you , keep it in .
if you be not mad , be gone .
will you hoist sail , sir ?
here lies your way .
tell me your mind .
speak your office .
it alone concerns your ear .
i bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage .
my words are as full of peace as matter .
yet you began rudely .
what are you ?
what would you ?
how now !
what news from her ?
away before me to sweet beds of flowers .
what i am and what i would are as secret as maidenhead .
give us the place alone .
most sweet lady— a comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it .
where lies your text ?
in propn ’ s bosom .
in his bosom ?
in what chapter of his bosom ?
to answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
oh , i have read it .
it is heresy .
have you no more to say ?
good madam , let me see your face .
have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
you are now out of your text .
but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
look you , sir , such a one i was this present .
is propn not well done ?
twill endure wind and weather .
o , sir , i will not be so hard - hearted .
i will give out divers schedules of my beauty .
but , if you were the devil , you are fair .
my lord and master loves you .
how does he love me ?
your lord does know my mind .
i can not love him .
yet i suppose him virtuous , know him noble , of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
in voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant ; and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person .
but yet i can not love him ; he might have took his answer long ago .
why , what would you ?
make me a willow cabin at your gate and call upon my soul within the house .
write loyal cantons of contemned love and sing them loud even in the dead of night .
you might do much .
above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
i am a gentleman .
get you to your lord .
i can not love him .
let him send no more— unless perchance you come to me again to tell me how he takes it .
fare you well .
i thank you for your pains .
spend this for me .
i am no fee ’ d post , lady .
keep your purse .
my master , not myself , lacks recompense .
propn , fair cruelty .
what is your parentage ? ” “ above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
not too fast !
soft , soft !
unless the master were the man .
how now ?
even so quickly may one catch the plague ?
well , let it be.— what ho , propn !
here , madam , at your service .
run after that same peevish messenger , the county ’ s man .
he left this ring behind him , would i or not .
propn , i will .
i do i know not what and fear to find mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
fate , show thy force .
ourselves we do not owe .
what is decreed must be , and be this so .
by your patience , no .
let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
no , sooth , sir .
my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in .
he left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
if the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
but you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
propn the day !
a lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
she is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
o good propn , forgive me your trouble .
if you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
fare you well at once .
i am bound to the propn propn ’ s court .
propn .
the gentleness of all the gods go with thee !
i have many enemies in propn ’ s court , else would i very shortly see thee there .
but , come what may , i do adore thee so that danger shall seem sport , and i will go .
were not you even now with the propn propn ?
even now , sir .
on a moderate pace i have since arrived but hither .
she returns this ring to you , sir .
you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
receive it so .
she took the ring of me .
i ’ ll none of it .
come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned .
i left no ring with her .
what means this lady ?
propn forbid my outside have not charmed her !
she made good view of me , indeed so much that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , for she did speak in starts distractedly .
she loves me , sure !
the cunning of her passion invites me in this churlish messenger .
i am the man .
if it be so , as ’ tis , propn lady , she were better love a dream .
how will this fadge ?
what will become of this ?
o time , thou must untangle this , not i .
it is too hard a knot for me to untie !
approach , propn propn .
not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and propn , my troth , i know not .
but i know to be up late is to be up late .
a false conclusion .
i hate it as an unfilled can .
thou'rt a scholar .
let us therefore eat and drink .
propn , i say !
a stoup of wine !
here comes the fool , i ' faith .
how now , my hearts !
did you never see the picture of “ we three ” ?
welcome , ass .
now let ’ s have a catch .
what country , friends , is this ?
this is propn , lady .
and what should i do in propn ?
my brother he is in propn .
perchance he is not drown ’ d .— what think you , sailors ?
it is perchance that you yourself were saved .
o , my poor brother !
and so perchance may he be .
true , madam .
propn thou this country ?
ay , madam , well , for i was bred and born not three hours ' travel from this very place .
by my troth , the fool has an excellent breast .
my lady has a white hand , and the propn are no bottle - ale houses .
if one knight give propn would you have a love song or a song of good life ?
a love song , a love song .
ay , ay .
i care not for good life .
excellent good , i ' faith .
good , good .
a mellifluous voice , as i am true knight .
a contagious breath .
very sweet and contagious , i ' faith .
shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
shall we do that ?
an you love me , let ’ s do propn .
most certain .
let our catch be “ propn propn . ” “ hold thy peace , thou knave , ” knight ?
i shall be constrained in propn to call thee knave , knight .
it begins “ hold thy peace . ” i shall never begin if i hold my peace .
good , i ' faith .
come , begin .
what a caterwauling do you keep here !
if my lady have not called up her steward propn and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
for the love o ' propn , peace !
my masters , are you mad ?
or what are you ?
have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
we did keep time , sir , in our catches .
sneck up !
propn propn , i must be round with you .
my lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she ’ s nothing allied to your disorders .
if you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house .
if not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
nay , good propn propn .
out o ' tune , sir .
you lie .
yes , by propn propn , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
thou'rt i ' the right .
go shake your ears !
twere as good a deed as to drink when a man ’ s a - hungry , to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
do propn , knight .
i ’ ll write thee a challenge .
or i ’ ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
propn propn propn , be patient for tonight .
since the youth of the count propn was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
for propn propn , let me alone with him .
i know i can do it .
o , if i thought that , i ’ d beat him like a dog !
i have no exquisite reason for propn , but i have reason good enough .
and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
what wilt thou do ?
i can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
excellent !
i have propn in my nose too .
he shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she ’ s in love with him .
my purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
and your horse now would make him an ass .
ass , i doubt not .
oh , ’ twill be admirable !
sport royal , i warrant you .
i know my physic will work with him .
i will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
observe his construction of it .
for this night , to bed , and dream on the event .
propn .
good night , propn .
before me , she ’ s a good wench .
she ’ s a beagle , true - bred , and one that adores me .
what o ' that ?
i was adored once too .
let ’ s to bed , knight .
thou hadst need send for more money .
if thou hast her not i ' the end , call me “ propn . ” if i do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
propn too late to go to bed now .
give me some music .
he is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
who was it ?
he is about the house .
thou dost speak masterly .
my life upon propn , young though thou art , thine eye propn stay ’ d upon some favor that it loves .
hath it not , boy ?
a little , by your favor .
what kind of woman is ’ t ?
of your complexion .
she is not worth thee , then .
what years , i ' faith ?
about your years , my lord .
too old by propn .
let still the woman take an elder than herself .
i think it well , my lord .
then let thy love be younger than thyself , or thy affection can not hold the bent .
for women are as roses , whose fair flower being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
and so they are .
alas , that they are so , to die even when they to perfection grow !
who governs here ?
a noble duke , in nature as in name .
what is his name ?
orsino .
orsino .
i have heard my father name him .
he was a bachelor then .
for but a month ago i went from hence , and then ’ twas fresh in murmur — as , you know , what great ones do the less will prattle of— that he did seek the love of fair propn .
what ’ s she ?
oh , that i served that lady and might not be delivered to the world , till i had made mine own occasion mellow , what my estate is .
are you ready , sir ?
no pains , sir .
i take pleasure in singing , sir .
i ’ ll pay thy pleasure then .
give me now leave to leave thee .
propn .
let all the rest give place .
once more , propn , get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
tell her my love , more noble than the world , propn not quantity of dirty lands ; the parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , tell her , i hold as giddily as fortune ; but ’ tis that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
but if she can not love you , sir ?
i can not be so answer ’ d .
sooth , but you must .
say that some lady , as perhaps there is , propn for your love a great a pang of heart as you have for propn .
must she not then be answered ?
there is no woman ’ s sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart .
no woman ’ s heart so big , to hold so much .
they lack retention .
alas , their love may be called appetite , no motion of the liver , but the palate , that suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; but mine is all as hungry as the sea , and can digest as much .
make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe propn .
ay , but i know— what dost thou know ?
too well what love women to men may owe .
in faith , they are as true of heart as we .
my father had a daughter loved a man as it might be , perhaps , were i a woman , i should your lordship .
and what ’ s her history ?
a blank , my lord .
was not this love indeed ?
but died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
i am all the daughters of my father ’ s house , and all the brothers too — and yet i know not .
propn , shall i to this lady ?
come thy ways , propn propn .
nay , i ’ ll come .
if i lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
propn thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep - biter come by some notable shame ?
i would exult , man .
you know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear - baiting here .
to anger him , we ’ ll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue .
shall we not , propn propn ?
an we do not , it is pity of our lives .
here comes the little villain .
how now , my metal of propn ?
get you all three into the boxtree .
propn ’ s coming down this walk .
he has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour .
observe him , for the love of mockery , for i know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him .
