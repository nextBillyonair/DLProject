who 's there ?
nay , answer me .
stand and unfold yourself .
long live the king !
propn ?
he .
you come most carefully upon your hour .
propn now struck twelve .
get thee to bed , propn .
for this relief much thanks .
tis bitter cold , and i am sick at heart .
have you had quiet guard ?
not a mouse stirring .
well , good night .
if you do meet propn and propn , the rivals of my watch , bid them make haste .
i think i hear them .
stand , ho !
who is there ?
friends to this ground .
and liegemen to the propn .
give you good night .
propn hath my place .
give you good night .
say , what , is propn there ?
a piece of him .
welcome , propn .
welcome , good propn .
what , has this thing appear 'd again to - night ?
i have seen nothing .
propn says ' tis but our fantasy , and will not let belief take hold of him propn this dreaded sight , twice seen of us .
therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night , that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it .
tush , tush , ' twill not appear .
sit down awhile , and let us once again assail your ears , that are so fortified against our story , what we two nights have seen .
well , sit we down , and let us hear propn speak of this .
last night of all , when yond same star that 's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns , propn and myself , the bell then beating one— peace !
look where it comes again !
in the same figure , like the propn that 's dead .
thou art a scholar ; speak to it , propn .
looks it not like the king ?
mark it , propn .
most like .
it harrows me with fear and wonder .
it would be spoke to .
question it , propn .
what art thou that usurp'st this time of night , together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried propn did sometimes march ?
by propn i charge thee speak !
it is offended .
see , it stalks away !
stay !
speak , speak !
i charge thee , speak !
tis gone , and will not answer .
how now , horatio ?
you tremble and look pale .
is not this something more than fantasy ?
what think you o n't ?
before my propn , i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes .
is it not like the king ?
as thou art to thyself .
tis strange .
thus twice before , and jump at this dead hour , with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch .
in what particular thought to work i know not ; but , in the gross and scope of my opinion , this bodes some strange eruption to our state .
who is't that can inform me ?
that can i ; at least the whisper goes so .
i think it be no other but e'en so .
well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch , so like the propn that was and is the question of these wars .
a mote it is to trouble the mind 's eye .
in the most high and palmy state of propn , a little ere the mightiest propn fell , the graves stood tenantless , and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets ; as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , disasters in the sun ; and the moist star , upon whose influence propn 's empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse .
and even the like precurse of feared events , as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on , have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climature and countrymen .
propn , where it comes again !
i 'll cross it , though it blast me .
stay illusion !
stay , and speak !
stop it , propn !
shall i strike at it with my partisan ?
do , if it will not stand .
tis here !
tis here !
tis gone !
we do it wrong , being so majestical , to offer it the show of violence ; for it is , as the air , invulnerable , and our vain blows malicious mockery .
it was about to speak , when the cock crew .
and then it started , like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons .
i have heard the cock , that is the trumpet to the morn , propn with his lofty and shrill - sounding throat propn the god of day , and at his warning , whether in sea or fire , in earth or air , the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine ; and of the truth herein this present object made probation .
it faded on the crowing of the cock .
so have i heard and do in part believe it .
but look , the morn , in russet mantle clad , propn propn the dew of yon high eastward hill .
break we our watch up ; and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young propn ; for , upon my life , this spirit , dumb to us , will speak to him .
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , as needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
let 's do't , i pray : and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently .
nor have we herein barr 'd your better wisdoms , which have freely gone with this affair along .
for all , our thanks .
now follows , that you know , young propn , holding a weak supposal of our worth , or thinking by our late dear brother 's death our state to be disjoint and out of frame , colleagued with this dream of his advantage , he hath not fail 'd to pester us with message , importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father , with all bonds of law , to our most valiant brother .
so much for him .
now for ourself , and for this time of meeting .
thus much the business is : we have here writ to propn , uncle of young propn who , impotent and bed - rid , scarcely hears of this his nephew 's purpose — to suppress his further gait herein , in that the levies , the lists , and full proportions , are all made out of his subject ; and we here dispatch you , good propn , and you , propn , for bearers of this greeting to old propn , giving to you no further personal power to business with the propn , more than the scope of these dilated articles allow .
propn , and let your haste commend your duty .
in that and all things will we show our duty .
we doubt it nothing .
heartily farewell .
and now , propn , what 's the news with you ?
you told us of some suit .
what is't , propn ?
you can not speak of reason to the propn , and lose your voice .
what wouldst thou beg , propn , that shall not be my offer , not thy asking ?
the head is not more native to the heart , the hand more instrumental to the mouth , than is the throne of propn to thy father .
what wouldst thou have , propn ?
have you your father 's leave ?
what says propn ?
he hath , my lord , wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition , and at last upon his will i seal 'd my hard consent .
i do beseech you , give him leave to go .
how is it that the clouds still hang on you ?
not so , my lord : i am too much i ' the sun .
propn propn , cast thy nighted color off , and let thine eye look like a friend on propn .
do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust .
ay , madam , it is common .
if it be , why seems it so particular with thee ?
seems , madam ?
nay , it is .
fie !
tis a fault to propn , a fault against the dead , a fault to nature , to reason most absurd , whose common theme is death of fathers , and who still hath cried , from the first corse till he that died today , this must be so .
we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe , and think of us as of a father ; for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne , and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you .
for your intent in going back to school in propn , it is most retrograde to our desire ; and we beseech you , bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye , our chiefest courtier , cousin , and our son .
let not thy mother lose her prayers , propn .
i pray thee , stay with us , go not to propn .
i shall in all my best obey you , madam .
why , ' tis a loving and a fair reply .
be as ourself in propn .
come away .
o propn !
propn !
how weary , stale , flat and unprofitable propn to me all the uses of this world !
propn o n't !
ah , fie !
tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed ; things rank and gross in nature propn it merely .
that it should come to this !
but two months dead !
propn and earth !
must i remember ?
frailty , thy name is woman— a little month , or ere those shoes were old with which she follow 'd my poor father 's body like propn , all tears — why she , even she— o propn !
a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn 'd longer — married with my uncle , my father 's brother , but no more like my father than i to propn .
within a month , propn yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes , she married .
o , most wicked speed , to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets !
it is not , nor it can not come to , good .
but break , my heart , for i must hold my tongue !
hail to your lordship !
i am glad to see you well .
propn — or i do forget myself .
the same , my lord , and your poor servant ever .
and what make you from propn , propn propn ?
a truant disposition , good my lord .
i would not hear your enemy say so , nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself .
i know you are no truant .
but what is your affair in propn ?
we 'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
my lord , i came to see your father 's funeral .
i prithee do not mock me , fellow student .
i think it was to see my mother 's wedding .
indeed , my lord , it followed hard upon .
thrift , thrift , propn .
the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables .
would i had met my dearest foe in propn or ever i had seen that day , propn !
my father — methinks i see my father .
o , where , my lord ?
in my mind 's eye , propn .
he was a man , take him for all in all ; i shall not look upon his like again .
my lord , i think i saw him yesternight .
my lord , the propn your father .
the propn my father ?
season your admiration for a while with an attent ear , till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen , this marvel to you .
for propn 's love let me hear !
but where was this ?
my lord , upon the platform where we watch 'd .
did you not speak to it ?
my lord , i did ; but answer made it none .
tis very strange .
as i do live , my honour 'd lord , ' tis true ; and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it .
hold you the watch tonight ?
we do , my lord .
arm 'd , say you ?
propn , my lord .
from top to toe ?
my lord , from head to foot .
then saw you not his face ?
o , yes , my lord !
he wore his beaver up .
what , look 'd he frowningly ?
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger .
propn , or red ?
nay , very pale .
and fix 'd his eyes upon you ?
most constantly .
i would i had been there .
it would have much amazed you .
very like , very like .
stay 'd it long ?
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
longer , longer .
not when i saw't .
his beard was grizzled , no ?
it was as i have seen it in his life , a sable silvered .
i warrant it will .
if it assume my noble father 's person , i 'll speak to it , though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace .
i pray you all , if you have hitherto conceal 'd this sight , let it be tenable in your silence still ; and whatsoever else shall hap tonight , give it an understanding , but no tongue .
i will requite your loves .
so , fare you well .
upon the platform , ' twixt eleven and twelve , i 'll visit you .
our duty to your honour .
your loves , as mine to you .
propn .
my father 's spirit in arms !
would the night were come .
till then sit still , my soul .
foul deeds will rise , though all the earth o'erwhelm them , to men 's eyes .
my necessaries are embark 'd .
propn .
and , sister , as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant , do not sleep , but let me hear from you .
do you doubt that ?
for propn , and the trifling of his favours , hold it a fashion , and a toy in blood ; a violet in the youth of primy nature , propn , not permanent , sweet , not lasting ; the perfume and suppliance of a minute ; no more .
think it no more .
for nature , crescent , does not grow alone in thews and bulk ; but as this temple waxes , the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal .
he may not , as unvalued persons do , carve for himself ; for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state , and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body propn he is the head .
then if he says he loves you , it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed ; which is no further than the main voice of propn goes withal .
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs , or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open to his unmast'red importunity .
fear it , propn , fear it , my dear sister , and keep you in the rear of your affection , out of the shot and danger of desire .
the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon .
virtue itself ' scapes not calumnious strokes .
the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed , and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent .
youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart .
but , good my brother , do not , as some ungracious pastors do , show me the steep and thorny way to propn , propn , like a puff 'd and reckless libertine , himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede .
o , fear me not !
i stay too long .
but here my father comes .
a double blessing is a double grace ; occasion smiles upon a second leave .
yet here , propn ?
aboard , aboard , for shame !
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail , and you are stay 'd for .
there , my blessing with thee .
and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character .
give thy thoughts no tongue , nor any unproportion 'd thought his act .
be thou familiar , but by no means vulgar .
those friends thou hast , and their adoption tried , grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel ; but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new - hatch 'd , unfledged comrade .
beware of entrance to a quarrel ; but being in , bear't that the opposed may beware of thee .
this above all : to thine own self be true , and it must follow , as the night the day , thou canst not then be false to any man .
propn .
my blessing season this in thee !
most humbly do i take my leave , my lord .
propn , propn , and remember well what i have said to you .
tis in my memory lock 'd , and you yourself shall keep the key of it .
propn .
what is't , propn , he hath said to you ?
so please you , something touching the propn propn .
marry , well bethought !
what is between you ?
give me up the truth .
he hath , my lord , of late made many tenders of his affection to me .
affection ?
pooh !
you speak like a green girl , unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
do you believe his tenders , as you call them ?
i do not know , my lord , what i should think .
marry , i 'll teach you .
think yourself a baby , that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay , which are not sterling .
tender yourself more dearly , or — not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , running it thus — you 'll tender me a fool .
my lord , he hath importuned me with love in honourable fashion .
and hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of propn .
ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
i do know , when the blood burns , how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows .
these blazes , daughter , giving more light than heat , extinct in both even in their promise , as it is a - making , you must not take for fire .
for propn propn , propn so much in him , that he is young , and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you .
in few , propn , do not believe his vows ; for they are brokers , not of that dye which their investments show , but mere implorators of unholy suits , breathing like sanctified and pious bonds , the better to beguile .
look propn , i charge you .
come your ways .
i shall obey , my lord .
the air bites shrewdly ; it is very cold .
it is a nipping and an eager air .
what hour now ?
i think it lacks of twelve .
no , it is struck .
indeed ?
i heard it not .
it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wo nt to walk .
what doth this mean , my lord ?
the propn doth wake tonight and takes his rouse , propn wassail , and the swaggering upspring reels , and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down , the kettle - drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge .
is it a custom ?
ay , marry , is't ; but to my mind , though i am native here and to the manner born , it is a custom more honour 'd in the breach than the observance .
so , oft it chances in particular men , that for some vicious mole of nature in them , as in their birth — wherein they are not guilty , since nature can not choose his origin— by the o'ergrowth of some complexion , propn breaking down the pales and forts of reason , or by some habit that too much o'erleavens the form of plausive manners , that these men— carrying , i say , the stamp of one defect , being nature 's livery , or fortune 's star— their virtues else — be they as pure as grace , as infinite as man may undergo— propn in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault .
the dram of evil propn all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal .
look , my lord , it comes !
angels and ministers of grace defend us !
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn 'd , bring with thee airs from propn or blasts from hell , be thy intents wicked or charitable , thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee .
o , answer me !
let me not burst in ignorance , but tell why thy canonized bones , hearsed in death , have burst their cerements , why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn 'd , propn oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again .
what may this mean that thou , dead corse , again , in complete steel , revisits thus the glimpses of the moon , making night hideous , and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ?
say , why is this ?
wherefore ?
what should we do ?
it beckons you to go away with it , as if it some impartment did desire to you alone .
look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground .
but do not go with it !
no , by no means .
it will not speak ; then will i follow it .
do not , my lord !
why , what should be the fear ?
i do not set my life at a pin 's fee ; and for my soul , what can it do to that , being a thing immortal as itself ?
it waves me forth again .
i 'll follow it .
what if it tempt you toward the flood , my lord , or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles propn his base into the sea , and there assume some other horrible form , which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness ?
think of it .
the very place puts toys of desperation , without more motive , into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath .
it waves me still .
go on ; i 'll follow thee .
you shall not go , my lord .
hold off your hands !
you shall not go .
my fate cries out , and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the propn lion 's nerve .
by propn , i 'll make a ghost of him that lets me .
i say , away !
he waxes desperate with imagination .
have after .
to what issue will this come ?
something is rotten in the state of propn .
propn will direct it .
nay , let 's follow him .
whither wilt thou lead me ?
speak !
i 'll go no further .
mark me .
i will .
pity me not , but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold .
speak ; i am bound to hear .
so art thou to revenge , when thou shalt hear .
what !
i am thy father 's spirit , doom 'd for a certain term to walk the night , and for the day confined to fast in fires , till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away .
but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison - house , i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul , freeze thy young blood , make thy two eyes , like stars , start from their spheres , propn knotted and combined locks to part , and each particular hair to stand an end like quills upon the fretful porpentine .
but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood .
list , list , o , list !
if thou didst ever thy dear father love— o propn !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
murder ?
murder most foul , as in the best it is ; but this most foul , strange , and unnatural .
haste me to know't , that i , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love , may sweep to my revenge .
i find thee apt ; and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that roots itself in ease on propn wharf , propn thou not stir in this .
now , propn , hear .
tis given out that , sleeping in mine orchard , a serpent stung me .
o my prophetic soul !
my uncle !
o propn , what a falling off was there !
but virtue , as it never will be moved , though lewdness court it in a shape of propn , so lust , though to a radiant angel link 'd , will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage .
but soft !
o , horrible !
o , horrible !
most horrible !
but , howsoever thou pursuest this act , propn not thy mind , nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught .
leave her to propn , and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her .
fare thee well at once .
the glow - worm shows the matin to be near and ' gins to pale his uneffectual fire .
propn , adieu , adieu !
remember me .
o all you host of propn !
o earth !
what else ?
and shall i couple hell ?
o , fie !
remember thee ?
ay , thou poor ghost , while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe .
remember thee ?
yea , from the table of my memory i 'll wipe away all trivial fond records , all saws of books , all forms , all pressures past , that youth and observation copied there ; and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain , propn with baser matter .
yes , by propn !
o most pernicious woman !
o villain , villain , smiling , damned villain !
my tables — meet it is i set it down that one may smile , and smile , and be a villain ; at least i am sure it may be so in propn .
so , uncle , there you are .
now to my word : it is ‘ propn , adieu !
remember me. ’ i have swor n't .
my lord , my lord !
so be it !
illo , ho , ho , my lord !
propn , ho , ho , boy !
come , bird , come .
how is't , my noble lord ?
what news , my lord ?
o , wonderful !
good my lord , tell it .
no ; you will reveal it .
not i , my lord , by propn !
nor i , my lord .
how say you , then ; would heart of man once think it ?
but you 'll be secret ?
ay , by propn , my lord .
there 's ne'er a villain dwelling in all propn but he 's an arrant knave .
there needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave to tell us this .
these are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
i am sorry they offend you , heartily ; yes , faith , heartily .
there 's no offence , my lord .
yes , by propn propn , but there is , propn , and much offence too .
touching this vision here , it is an honest ghost , that let me tell you .
for your desire to know what is between us o'ermaster't as you may .
and now , good friends , as you are friends , scholars , and soldiers , give me one poor request .
what is't , my lord ?
we will .
never make known what you have seen to - night .
my lord , we will not .
nay , but swear't .
in faith , my lord , not i .
nor i , my lord , in faith .
upon my sword .
we have sworn , my lord , already .
indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
swear .
art thou there , truepenny ?
come on !
propose the oath , my lord .
swear .
propn propn ubique ?
then we 'll shift our ground .
come hither , gentlemen , and lay your hands again upon my sword .
never to speak of this that you have heard : swear by my sword .
swear .
well said , old mole !
propn work i ' the earth so fast ?
a worthy pioner !
once more remove , good friends .
o day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
there are more things in propn and earth , propn , than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
swear .
rest , rest , perturbed spirit !
let us go in together ; and still your fingers on your lips , i pray .
the time is out of joint .
o cursed spite , that ever i was born to set it right !
nay , come , let 's go together .
give him this money and these notes , propn .
i will , my lord .
you shall do marvellous wisely , good propn , before you visit him , to make inquire of his behaviour .
my lord , i did intend it .
marry , well said , very well said .
look you , sir , propn me first what danskers are in propn , and how , and who , what means , and where they keep , what company , at what expense ; and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son , come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it .
take you , as ' twere , some distant knowledge of him , as thus , ‘ i know his father and his friends , and in part propn do you mark this , propn ?
ay , very well , my lord .
and in part him , but , ’ you may say , ‘ not well .
as gaming , my lord ?
ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , quarrelling , drabbing .
you may go so far .
my lord , that would dishonour him .
faith , no ; as you may season it in the charge .
you must not put another scandal on him , that he is open to incontinency .
that 's not my meaning ; but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty , the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind , a savageness in unreclaimed blood , of general assault .
but , my good lord— propn should you do this ?
ay , my lord , i would know that .
marry , sir , here 's my drift , and i believe it is a fetch of warrant .
and then , sir , does he this — he does — what was i about to say ?
so , by my former lecture and advice , shall you my son .
you have me , have you not ?
my lord , i have .
good my lord !
observe his inclination in yourself .
i shall , my lord .
and let him play his music .
well , my lord .
farewell !
o , my lord , my lord , i have been so affrighted !
with what , i ' the name of propn ?
my lord , as i was sewing in my closet , propn propn , with his doublet all unbraced , no hat upon his head , his stockings fouled , ungartered , and down - gyved to his ankle ; propn as his shirt , his knees knocking each other , and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors , he comes before me .
mad for thy love ?
my lord , i do not know , but truly i do fear it .
what said he ?
he took me by the wrist and held me hard ; then goes he to the length of all his arm , and , with his other hand thus o'er his brow , he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it .
come , go with me .
i will go seek the king .
this is the very ecstasy of love , whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under propn that does afflict our natures .
no , my good lord ; but , as you did command , i did repel his letters and denied his access to me .
that hath made him mad .
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him .
i fear 'd he did but trifle and meant to wrack thee ; but beshrew my jealousy !
by propn , it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion .
come , go we to the propn .
this must be known ; which , being kept close , might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love .
welcome , dear propn and propn .
moreover that we much did long to see you , the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending .
what it should be , more than his father 's death , that thus hath put him so much from the understanding of himself , i can not dream of .
i entreat you both that , being of so young days brought up with him , and sith so neighbour 'd to his youth and haviour , that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time ; so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures , and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean , whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open 'd lies within our remedy .
good gentlemen , he hath much talk 'd of you , and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres .
if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope , your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king 's remembrance .
both your propn propn , by the sovereign power you have of us , put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty .
but we both obey , and here give up ourselves , in the full bent , to lay our service freely at your feet , to be commanded .
thanks , propn and gentle propn .
thanks , guildenstern and gentle propn .
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son .
go , some of you , and bring these gentlemen where propn is .
heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him !
ay , amen !
the ambassadors from propn , my good lord , are joyfully return 'd .
thou still hast been the father of good news .
have i , my lord ?
assure you , my good liege , i hold my duty as i hold my soul , both to my propn and to my gracious king .
and i do think , or else this brain of mine propn not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do , that i have found the very cause of propn 's lunacy .
thyself do grace to them , and bring them in .
he tells me , my dear propn , he hath found the head and source of all your son 's distemper .
i doubt it is no other but the main , his father 's death and our o'erhasty marriage .
well , we shall sift him .
welcome , my good friends .
say , propn , what from our brother propn ?
it likes us well ; and at our more consider 'd time we 'll read , propn , and think upon this business .
meantime we thank you for your well - took labour .
go to your rest ; at night we 'll feast together .
most welcome home !
this business is well ended .
mad call i it ; for , to define true madness , what is't but to be nothing else but mad ?
but let that go .
propn , i swear i use no art at all .
thus it remains , and the remainder thus .
perpend .
i have a daughter — have while she is mine— who in her duty and obedience , mark , propn given me this .
now gather , and surmise .
propn thou the stars are fire ; doubt that the sun doth move ; doubt truth to be a liar ; but never doubt i love .
o dear propn , i am ill at these numbers ; i have not art to reckon my groans .
but that i love thee best , o most best , believe it .
propn .
propn evermore , most dear lady , whilst this machine is to him , propn .
this , in obedience , hath my daughter shown me ; and more above , hath his solicitings , as they fell out by time , by means , and place , all given to mine ear .
but how hath she receiv 'd his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a man faithful and honourable .
i would fain prove so .
do you think ' tis this ?
it may be , very like .
propn there been such a time — i would fain know that— that i have positively said ‘ ' tis so , ’ when it proved otherwise ?
not that i know .
take this from this , if this be otherwise .
if circumstances lead me , i will find where truth is hid , though it were hid indeed within the centre .
how may we try it further ?
you know , sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby .
so he does indeed .
at such a time i 'll loose my daughter to him .
be you and i behind an arras then ; mark the encounter .
if he love her not , and he not from his reason fall'n thereon let me be no assistant for a state , but keep a farm and carters .
we will try it .
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading .
o , give me leave .
how does my good propn propn ?
well , propn - a - mercy .
do you know me , my lord ?
not i , my lord .
then i would you were so honest a man .
honest , my lord ?
that 's very true , my lord .
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion — have you a daughter ?
i have , my lord .
let her not walk i ' th ' sun .
conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceive .
friend , look to't .
how say you by that ?
still harping on my daughter .
he is far gone .
and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love , very near this .
words , words , words .
what is the matter , my lord ?
between who ?
i mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
all which , sir , though i most powerfully and potently believe , yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down ; for you yourself , sir , shall grow old as i am if , if like a crab , you could go backward .
into my grave ?
indeed , that is out of the air .
aside .
how sometimes his replies are !
a happiness that often madness hits on , which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of .
you can not , sir , take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal — except my life , except my life , except my life .
fare you well , my lord .
these tedious old fools !
propn save you , sir !
my honoured lord !
my most dear lord !
my excellent good friends !
how dost thou , guildenstern ?
ah , propn !
good lads , how do ye both ?
as the indifferent children of the earth .
nor the soles of her shoe ?
neither , my lord .
then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favours ?
faith , her privates we .
in the secret parts of propn ?
what news ?
none , my lord , but that the world 's grown honest .
prison , my lord ?
propn 's a prison .
then is the world one .
a goodly one ; in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , propn being one o ' the worst .
we think not so , my lord .
why , then ' tis none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so .
to me it is a prison .
o propn , i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space , were it not that i have bad dreams .
which dreams indeed are ambition ; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
a dream itself is but a shadow .
truly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow 's shadow .
then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .
shall we to the court ?
for , by my fay , i can not reason .
we 'll wait upon you .
no such matter !
i will not sort you with the rest of my servants ; for , to speak to you like an honest man , i am most dreadfully attended .
but in the beaten way of friend- ship , what make you at propn ?
to visit you , my lord ; no other occasion .
beggar that i am , i am even poor in thanks ; but i thank you ; and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .
were you not sent for ?
is it your own inclin- ing ?
is it a free visitation ?
come , deal justly with me .
what should we say , my lord ?
why , anything , but to the purpose .
you were sent for ; and there is a kind of confession in your looks , which your modesties have not craft enough to colour .
i know the good propn and propn have sent for you .
to what end , my lord ?
that you must teach me .
but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the obligation of our ever - preserved love , and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal , be even and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no .
what say you ?
my lord , we were sent for .
i have of late — but wherefore i know not— lost all my mirth , forgone all custom of exercises ; and indeed , it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame , the earth , seems to me a sterile promontory ; this most excellent canopy , the air , look you , this brave o'erhanging firmament , this majestical roof fretted with golden fire , why , it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours .
what a piece of work is a man !
how noble in reason !
how infinite in faculty !
in form and moving how express and admirable !
in action how like an angel !
in apprehension how like a god !
and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust ?
man delights not me — no , nor woman nei- ther , though by your smiling you seem to say so .
my lord , there was no such stuff in my thoughts .
why did you laugh then , when i said man delights not me ?
to think , my lord , if you delight not in man , what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you .
we coted them on the way , and hither are they com- ing to offer you service .
what players are they ?
even those you were wo nt to take such delight in , the tragedians of the city .
how chances it they travel ?
their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city ?
are they so followed ?
no , indeed , are they not .
how comes it ?
do they grow rusty ?
nay , their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace ; but there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't .
these are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages — so they call them — that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose - quills and dare scarce come thither .
what , are they children ?
who maintains 'em ?
how are they escoted ?
will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?
will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players — as it is most like , if their means are no better — their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?
faith , there has been much to do on both sides ; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controver- sy .
there was , for a while , no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question .
is't possible ?
o , there has been much throwing about of brains .
do the boys carry it away ?
ay , that they do , my lord , propn and his load too .
it is not very strange ; for my uncle is propn of propn , and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .
sblood , there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .
there are the players .
gentlemen , you are welcome to propn .
your hands , come !
then appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony .
let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players — which , i tell you , must show fairly outwards — should more appear like entertainment than yours .
you are welcome .
but my uncle - father and aunt- mother are deceived .
in what , my dear lord ?
i am but mad north - north - west .
when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw .
well be with you , gentlemen !
propn you , propn , and you too — at each ear a hearer !
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts .
happily he 's the second time come to them ; for they say an old man is twice a child .
i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players .
mark it .
you say right , sir ; propn ' propn morning ; ' twas so indeed .
buzz , buzz !
seneca can not be too heavy , nor propn too light .
for the law of writ and the liberty , these are the only men .
o propn , judge of propn , what a treasure hadst thou !
what treasure had he , my lord ?
why , ‘ one fair daughter , and no more , the which he loved passing propn still on my daughter .
am i not i ' the right , old propn ?
if you call me propn , my lord , i have a daughter that i love passing well .
nay , that follows not .
what follows then , my lord ?
why , as by lot , propn wot , and then , you know , it came to pass , as most like it was.— the first row of the pious chanson will show you more ; for look where my abridgment comes .
you are welcome , masters ; welcome , all .
i am glad to see thee well .
welcome , good friends .
what , my young lady and mistress ?
by'r lady , your ladyship is nearer to propn than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine .
pray propn , your voice , like a piece of uncurrent gold , be not cracked within the ring .
masters , you are all welcome .
we 'll e'en propn like french falconers , fly at any thing we see .
we 'll have a speech straight .
come , give us a taste of your quality .
come , a passionate speech .
what speech , my good lord ?
i heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was never acted ; or if it was , not above once ; for the play , i remember , pleased not the million , ' twas caviary to the general ; but it was — as i received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine — an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much mod- esty as cunning .
i remember one said there were no sal- lets in the lines to make the matter savoury , nor no mat- ter in the phrase that might indict the author of affecta- tion ; but called it an honest method , as wholesome as sweet , and by very much more handsome than fine .
head to foot now is he total gules , horridly trick 'd with blood of fathers , mothers , daughters , sons .
fore propn , my lord , well spoken , with good accent and good discretion .
propn he finds him , striking too short at propn .
his antique sword , propn to his arm , lies where it falls , propn to command .
unequal match 'd , propn at propn drives , in rage strikes wide ; but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls .
then senseless propn , seeming to feel this blow , with flaming top stoops to his base , and with a hideous crash takes prisoner propn ' ear .
for lo !
his sword , which was declining on the milky head of reverend propn , seem 'd i ' the air to stick .
so , as a painted tyrant , propn stood , and like a neutral to his will and matter , did nothing .
but as we often see , against some storm , a silence in the heavens , the rack stand still , the bold winds speechless , and the orb below as hush as death — anon the dreadful thunder propn rend the region ; so , after propn ' pause , aroused vengeance sets him new a - work ; and never did the propn ' hammers fall on propn 's armour , forged for proof eterne , with less remorse than propn ' bleeding sword now falls on propn .
out , out , thou strumpet , propn !
all you gods , in general synod take away her power ; break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel , and bowl the round nave down the hill of propn , as low as to the fiends !
this is too long .
it shall to the barber 's , with your beard .
prithee say on .
he 's for a jig or a tale of bawdry , or he sleeps .
say on ; come to propn .
mobled propn is good .
run barefoot up and down , threatening the flames with bisson rheum ; a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood , and for a robe , about her lank and all o'erteemed loins , a blanket , in the alarm of fear caught up— who this had seen , with tongue in venom steep 'd ' propn propn 's state would treason have pronounced .
but if the gods themselves did see her then , when she saw propn make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband 's limbs , the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods .
look , whether he has not turned his colour , and has tears in 's eyes .
prithee no more !
tis well .
i 'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon .
good my lord , will you see the players well bestow 'd ?
do you hear ?
let them be well used ; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time .
after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live .
my lord , i will use them according to their desert .
propn 's bodykins , man , much better !
use every man after his desert , and who shall ' scape whipping ?
use them after your own honour and dignity .
the less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
take them in .
come , sirs .
follow him , friends .
we 'll hear a play to - morrow .
dost thou hear me , old friend ?
we 'll ha't tomorrow night .
ay , my lord .
very well .
follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
my good friends , i 'll leave you till night .
you are wel- come to propn .
good my lord !
ay , so , propn be wi ' ye !
now i am alone .
o , what a rogue and peasant slave am i !
is it not monstrous that this player here , but in a fiction , in a dream of passion , could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wann 'd , tears in his eyes , distraction in 's aspect , a broken voice , and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit ?
and all for nothing !
for propn !
what 's propn to him , or he to propn , that he should weep for her ?
what would he do , had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have ?
he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech ; make mad the guilty and appal the free , propn the ignorant , and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears .
am i a coward ?
who calls me villain ?
breaks my pate across ?
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
tweaks me by the nose ?
gives me the lie i ' the throat , as deep as to the lungs ?
bloody , bawdy villain !
remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
o , vengeance !
why , what an ass am i !
this is most brave , that i , the son of a dear father murder 'd , prompted to my revenge by propn and hell , must , like a whore , unpack my heart with words and fall a - cursing like a very drab , a scullion !
propn upo n't !
foh !
about , my brain !
propn , i have heard that guilty creatures , sitting at a play , have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim 'd their malefactions ; for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ , i 'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle .
i 'll observe his looks ; i 'll tent him to the quick .
if he but blench , i know my course .
i 'll have grounds more relative than this .
the play 's the thing wherein i 'll catch the conscience of the propn .
and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion , grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
he does confess he feels himself distracted , but from what cause he will by no means speak .
nor do we find him forward to be sounded , but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state .
did he receive you well ?
most like a gentleman .
but with much forcing of his disposition .
propn of question , but of our demands most free in his reply .
did you assay him to any pastime ?
propn , it so fell out that certain players we o'erraught on the way .
of these we told him , and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it .
they are here about the court , and , as i think , they have already order this night to play before him .
tis most true ; and he beseech 'd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter .
with all my heart , and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin 'd .
good gentlemen , give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights .
we shall , my lord .
propn propn , leave us too ; for we have closely sent for propn hither , that he , as ' twere by accident , may here propn propn .
her father and myself , lawful espials , will so bestow ourselves that , seeing unseen , we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him , as he is behaved , if't be the affliction of his love or no , that thus he suffers for .
so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again , to both your honours .
propn , i wish it may .
propn , walk you here .
gracious , so please you , we will bestow ourselves .
read on this book , that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness .
we are oft to blame in this— ' tis too much proved — that with devotion 's visage and pious action we do sugar propn the propn himself .
o , ' tis too true !
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience !
the harlot 's cheek , beautied with plastering art , is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word .
o heavy burden !
i hear him coming .
let 's withdraw , my lord .
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , the pangs of disprized love , the law 's delay , the insolence of office , and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ?
who would fardels bear , to grunt and sweat under a weary life , but that the dread of something after death the propn country , from whose bourn no traveller returns , puzzles the will , and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of ?
thus conscience does make cowards of us all , and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought , and enterprises of great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action .
soft you now !
the fair propn !
propn , in thy orisons be all my sins remembered .
good my lord , how does your honour for this many a day ?
i humbly thank you ; well , well , well .
my lord , i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to redeliver .
i pray you , now receive them .
my honour 'd lord , you know right well you did , and with them words of so sweet breath compos 'd as made the things more rich .
their perfume lost , take these again ; for to the noble mind propn gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind .
there , my lord .
are you honest ?
my lord ?
are you fair ?
what means your lordship ?
that if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
ay , truly ; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness .
this was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .
i did love you once .
indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
you should not have believed me ; for virtue can not so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it .
i loved you not .
i was the more deceived .
get thee to a nunnery !
why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ?
i am myself indifferent honest , but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me .
i am very proud , revengeful , ambitious ; with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .
what should such fellows as i do , crawling between earth and propn ?
we are arrant knaves all ; believe none of us .
go thy ways to a nunnery .
where 's your father ?
at home , my lord .
let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool nowhere but in 's own house .
propn .
o , help him , you sweet heavens !
if thou dost marry , i 'll give thee this plague for thy dowry : be thou as chaste as ice , as pure as snow , thou shalt not escape calumny .
get thee to a nunnery .
go , farewell .
or if thou wilt needs marry , marry a fool ; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them .
to a nunnery , go ; and quickly too .
propn .
o heavenly powers , restore him !
you jig , you amble , and you lisp ; and nickname propn 's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance .
i say , we will have no more marriages .
those that are married already — all but one — shall live ; the rest shall keep as they are .
to a nunnery , go .
o , what a noble mind is here o'erthrown !
the courtier 's , scholar 's , soldier 's , eye , tongue , sword , the expectancy and rose of the fair state , the glass of fashion and the mould of form , the observed of all observers , quite , quite down !
and i , of ladies most deject and wretched , that suck 'd the honey of his music vows , now see that noble and most sovereign reason , like sweet bells jangled , out of tune and harsh ; that unmatch 'd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy .
o , woe is me , to have seen what i have seen , see what i see !
love ?
his affections do not that way tend ; nor what he spake , though it lack 'd form a little , was not like madness .
there 's something in his soul propn which his melancholy sits on brood ; and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger ; which for to prevent , i have in quick determination thus set it down : he shall with speed to propn for the demand of our neglected tribute .
haply the seas , and countries different , with variable objects shall expel this something - settled matter in his heart , propn his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself .
what think you o n't ?
it shall do well .
but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief propn from neglected love .
how now , propn ?
my lord , do as you please ; but , if you hold it fit , after the play , let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief .
let her be round with him ; and i 'll be placed , so please you , in the ear of all their conference .
if she find him not , to propn send him ; or confine him where your wisdom best shall think .
it shall be so .
madness in great ones must not unwatch 'd go .
speak the speech , i pray you , as i pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .
but if you mouth it , as many of our players do , i had as lief the town - crier spoke my lines .
o , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig - pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who , for the most part , are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb - shows and noise .
pray you avoid it .
i warrant your honour .
be not too tame neither ; but let your own discretion be your tutor .
propn the action to the word , the word to the action ; with this special observance , that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature : for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing , whose end , both at the first and now , was and is , to hold , as ' twere , the mirror up to nature ; to show virtue her own feature , scorn her own image , and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure .
now this overdone , or come tardy off , though it make the unskilful laugh , can not but make the judicious grieve ; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others .
o , there be players that i have seen play , and heard others praise , and that highly , not to speak it profanely , that , neither having the accent of propn , nor the gait of propn , pagan , nor man , have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of propn 's journeymen had made men , and not made them well , they imitated humanity so abominably .
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
o , reform it altogether !
that 's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it .
go make you ready .
how now , my lord ?
will the propn hear this piece of work ?
and the propn too , and that presently .
we will , my lord .
what , ho , propn !
here , sweet lord , at your service .
horatio , thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation cop 'd withal .
why should the poor be flatter 'd ?
no , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning .
dost thou hear ?
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice , and could of men distinguish her election , propn propn thee for herself .
for thou hast been as one , in suff'ring all , that suffers nothing ; a man that propn 's buffets and rewards propn ta'en with equal thanks ; and blest are those whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled that they are not a pipe for propn 's finger to sound what stop she please .
give me that man that is not passion 's slave , and i will wear him in my heart 's core , ay , in my heart of heart , as i do thee .
something too much of this .
there is a play tonight before the propn .
one scene of it comes near the circumstance , which i have told thee , of my father 's death .
i prithee , when thou seest that act afoot , even with the very comment of thy soul observe my uncle .
if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech , it is a damned ghost that we have seen , and my imaginations are as foul as propn 's stithy .
give him heedful note ; for i mine eyes will rivet to his face , and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming .
well , my lord .
if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing , and ' scape detecting , i will pay the theft .
they are coming to the play .
i must be idle .
get you a place .
how fares our cousin propn ?
excellent , i ' faith ; of the chameleon 's dish .
i eat the air , promise - cramm 'd .
you can not feed capons so .
no , nor mine now .
my lord , you play 'd once i ' th ' university , you say ?
that did i , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
what did you enact ?
i did enact propn propn ; i was killed i ' the propn ; propn killed me .
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there .
be the players ready .
come hither , my dear propn , sit by me .
o , ho !
do you mark that ?
propn , shall i lie in your lap ?
no , my lord .
i mean , my head upon your lap ?
ay , my lord .
do you think i meant country matters ?
i think nothing , my lord .
that 's a fair thought to lie between maids ' legs .
what is , my lord ?
nothing .
you are merry , my lord .
who , i ?
ay , my lord .
o propn , your only jig - maker !
what should a man do but be merry ?
for , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within 's two hours .
nay ' tis twice two months , my lord .
so long ?
nay then , let the devil wear black , for i 'll have a suit of sables .
o heavens !
die two months ago , and not forgotten yet ?
marry , this is miching mallecho ; it means mischief .
propn this show imports the argument of the play .
we shall know by this fellow .
the players can not keep counsel ; they 'll tell all .
will he tell us what this show meant ?
ay , or any show that you 'll show him .
be not you ashamed to show , he 'll not shame to tell you what it means .
you are naught , you are naught !
i 'll mark the play .
for us , and for our tragedy , here stooping to your clemency , we beg your hearing patiently .
is this a prologue , or the posy of a ring ?
tis brief , my lord .
as woman 's love .
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o'er ere love be done !
that i distrust you .
now , what my love is , proof hath made you know ; and as my love is sized , my fear is so .
where love is great , the littlest doubts are fear ; where little fears grow great , great love grows there .
such love must needs be treason in my breast .
in second husband let me be accurst !
none we d the second but who killed the first .
the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift , but none of love .
a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed .
i do believe you think what now you speak ; but what we do determine oft we break .
purpose is but the slave to memory , of violent birth , but poor validity ; which now , like fruit unripe , sticks on the tree , but fall unshaken when they mellow be .
most necessary ' tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt .
what to ourselves in passion we propose , the passion ending , doth the purpose lose .
the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy .
where joy most revels , grief doth most lament ; propn joys , joy grieves , on slender accident .
this world is not for aye , nor ' tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change ; for ' tis a question left us yet to prove , whether love lead fortune , or else fortune love .
but , orderly to end where i begun , our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown ; our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our own .
so think thou wilt no second husband we d ; but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead .
if she should break it now !
tis deeply sworn .
sleep rock thy brain , and never come mischance between us twain !
propn , how like you this play ?
the lady doth protest too much , methinks .
o , but she 'll keep her word .
have you heard the argument ?
is there no offence i n't ?
no , no !
they do but jest , poison in jest ; no offence i ' the world .
what do you call the play ?
the propn .
marry , how ?
tropically .
this play is the image of a murder done in propn .
tis a knavish piece of work ; but what o ' that ?
your propn , and we that have free souls , it touches us not .
let the galled jade winch ; our withers are unwrung .
this is one propn , nephew to the propn .
you are as good as a chorus , my lord .
i could interpret between you and your love , if i could see the puppets dallying .
you are keen , my lord , you are keen .
it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge .
still better , and worse .
so you must take your husbands .
begin , murderer .
pox , leave thy damnable faces , and begin !
he poisons him i ' the garden for his estate .
his name 's gonzago .
the propn rises .
what , frighted with false fire ?
how fares my lord ?
give o'er the play .
give me some light .
away !
propn , lights , lights !
would not this , sir , and a forest of feathers — if the rest of my fortunes turn propn with me — with two provincial roses on my razed shoes , get me a fellowship in a cry of players , sir ?
half a share .
you might have rhymed .
o good propn , i 'll take the ghost 's word for a thousand pound !
didst perceive ?
very well , my lord .
upon the talk of the poisoning ?
i did very well note him .
ah , ha !
come , some music !
come , some music !
good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
propn , a whole history .
the propn , sir— ay , sir , what of him ?
is in his retirement , marvellous distempered .
with drink , sir ?
no , my lord ; rather with choler .
your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor ; for , me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler .
good my lord , put your discourse into some frame , and start not so wildly from my affair .
i am tame , sir .
pronounce .
the propn , your mother , in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you .
you are welcome .
nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed .
propn , i can not .
what , my lord ?
but , sir , such answer as i can make , you shall command ; or rather , as you say , my mother .
therefore no more , but to the matter !
o wonderful son , that can so astonish a mother !
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother 's admiration ?
she desires to speak with you in her closet , ere you go to bed .
we shall obey , were she ten times our mother .
have you any further trade with us ?
my lord , you once did love me .
so i do still , by these pickers and stealers !
good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty , if you deny your griefs to your friend .
propn , i lack advancement .
how can that be , when you have the voice of the propn himself for your succession in propn ?
ay , sir , but ' while the grass grows'—the proverb is something musty .
o , the recorders !
let me see one .
to withdraw with you— why do you go about to recover the wind of me , as if you would drive me into a toil ?
o , my lord , if my duty be too bold , my love is too unmannerly .
i do not well understand that .
will you play upon this pipe ?
my lord , i can not .
i pray you .
believe me , i can not .
i do beseech you .
i know no touch of it , my lord .
it is as easy as lying .
govern these ventages with your fingers and thumbs , give it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most eloquent music .
look you , these are the stops .
why , look you now , how unworthy a thing you make of me !
you would play upon me ; you would seem to know my stops ; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery ; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass ; and there is much music , excellent voice , in this little organ , yet can not you make it speak .
sblood , do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , you can not play upon me .
propn bless you , sir !
my lord , the propn would speak with you , and presently .
do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a camel ?
by the mass , and ' tis like a camel , indeed .
methinks it is like a weasel .
it is backed like a weasel .
or like a whale .
very like a whale .
then will i come to my mother by and by .
i will say so .
by and by ' is easily said .
leave me , friends .
propn now the very witching time of night , when churchyards yawn , and hell itself breathes out propn to this world .
now could i drink hot blood , and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on .
soft !
now to my mother !
o heart , lose not thy nature ; let not ever the soul of propn enter this firm bosom .
i like him not , nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range .
the terms of our estate may not endure propn so near us as doth hourly grow out of his brows .
we will ourselves provide .
most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your propn .
the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from noyance ; but much more that spirit upon whose weal depends and rests the lives of many .
the cess of majesty dies not alone , but like a gulf doth draw what 's near it with it .
it is a massy wheel , propn on the summit of the highest mount , to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortised and adjoin 'd ; which , when it falls , each small annexment , petty consequence , attends the boisterous ruin .
never alone did the propn sigh , but with a general groan .
arm you , i pray you , to this speedy voyage ; for we will fetters put upon this fear , which now goes too free - footed .
we will haste us .
my lord , he 's going to his mother 's closet .
behind the arras i 'll convey myself , to hear the process .
i 'll warrant she 'll tax him home ; and , as you said , and wisely was it said , ' tis meet that some more audience than a mother , since nature makes them partial , should o'erhear the speech , of vantage .
fare you well , my liege .
i 'll call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know .
thanks , dear my lord .
what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brother 's blood , is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow ?
propn serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence ?
and what 's in prayer but this twofold force , to be forestalled ere we come to fall , or pardon 'd being down ?
then i 'll look up ; my fault is past .
but , o , what form of prayer can serve my turn ?
forgive me my foul murder ?
that can not be ; since i am still possess 'd of those effects for which i did the murder— my crown , mine own ambition , and my queen .
may one be pardon 'd and retain the offence ?
what then ?
what rests ?
try what repentance can .
what can it not ?
o bosom black as death !
o limed soul , that , struggling to be free , propn more engaged !
help , angels !
make assay .
propn , stubborn knees ; and heart with strings of steel , be soft as sinews of the new - born babe !
all may be well .
that would be scann 'd .
a villain kills my father ; and for that , i , his sole son , do this same villain send to propn .
o , this is hire and salary , not revenge !
he took my father grossly , full of bread , with all his crimes broad blown , as flush as propn ; and how his audit stands , who knows save propn ?
no .
up , sword , and know thou a more horrid hent .
when he is drunk asleep ; or in his rage ; or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed ; at game , a - swearing , or about some act that has no relish of salvation i n't then trip him , that his heels may kick at propn , and that his soul may be as damn 'd and black as hell , whereto it goes .
my mother stays .
this physic but prolongs thy sickly days .
my words fly up , my thoughts remain below .
words without thoughts never to propn go .
he will come straight .
look you lay home to him .
tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with , and that your propn hath screen 'd and stood between much heat and him .
i 'll silence me even here .
pray you , be round with him .
withdraw ; i hear him coming .
now , mother , what 's the matter ?
propn , thou hast thy father much offended .
mother , you have my father much offended .
come , come , you answer with an idle tongue .
go , go , you question with a wicked tongue .
why , how now , propn ?
what 's the matter now ?
have you forgot me ?
no , by the rood , not so !
you are the propn , your husband 's brother 's wife , and — would it were not so — you are my mother .
nay , then , i 'll set those to you that can speak .
what wilt thou do ?
thou wilt not murder me ?
help , help , ho !
what , ho !
help , help , help !
draws .
o , i am slain !
o me , what hast thou done ?
nay , i know not .
is it the king ?
o , what a rash and bloody deed is this !
a bloody deed .
almost as bad , good mother , as kill a king , and marry with his brother .
as kill a king ?
ay , lady , it was my word .
thou wretched , rash , intruding fool , farewell !
i took thee for thy better .
leave wringing of your hands .
peace !
what have i done , that thou darest wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me ?
propn 's face doth glow ; propn , this solidity and compound mass , with tristful visage , as against the doom , is thought - sick at the act .
ay me , what act , that roars so loud and thunders in the index ?
look here upon this picture , and on this , the counterfeit presentment of two brothers .
here is your husband , like a mildew 'd ear blasting his wholesome brother .
have you eyes ?
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed , and batten on this propn ?
ha !
have you eyes ?
what devil was't that thus hath cozen 'd you at hoodman - blind ?
eyes without feeling , feeling without sight , ears without hands or eyes , smelling sans all , or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope .
o shame !
where is thy blush ?
rebellious hell , if thou canst mutine in a matron 's bones , to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire .
proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge , since frost itself as actively doth burn , and reason panders will .
o propn , speak no more !
thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul , and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct .
nay , but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed , stew 'd in corruption , honeying and making love over the nasty sty !
no more !
a king of shreds and patches !
save me and hover o'er me with your wings , you heavenly guards !
what would your gracious figure ?
alas , he 's mad !
do you not come your tardy son to chide , that , lapsed in time and passion , lets go by the important acting of your dread command ?
o , say !
do not forget .
this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose .
but look , amazement on thy mother sits .
speak to her , propn .
how is it with you , lady ?
alas , how is't with you , that you do bend your eye on vacancy , and with the incorporal air do hold discourse ?
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep ; and , as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm , your bedded hairs , like life in excrements , start up and stand on end .
o gentle son , upon the heat and flame of thy distemper propn cool patience !
propn do you look ?
on him , on him !
look you how pale he glares !
then what i have to do will want true colour — tears perchance for blood .
to whom do you speak this ?
do you see nothing there ?
nothing at all ; yet all that is i see .
nor did you nothing hear ?
no , nothing but ourselves .
why , look you there !
look how it steals away !
my father , in his habit as he liv 'd !
look where he goes even now out at the portal !
this is the very coinage of your brain .
this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in .
propn ?
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music .
it is not madness that i have utt'red .
bring me to the test , and i the matter will reword ; which madness would gambol from .
mother , for love of grace , propn not that flattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks .
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place , propn rank corruption , mining all within , infects unseen .
confess yourself to propn ; propn what 's past ; avoid what is to come ; and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker .
forgive me this my virtue ; for in the fatness of these pursy times propn itself of vice must pardon beg propn , curb and woo for leave to do him good .
o propn , thou hast cleft my heart in twain .
o , throw away the worser part of it , and live the purer with the other half , good night — but go not to my uncle 's bed .
assume a virtue , if you have it not .
that monster , custom , who all sense doth eat of habits evil , is angel yet in this , that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery , that aptly is put on .
refrain to - night , and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence ; the next more easy ; for use almost can change the stamp of nature , and [ either master ] the devil , or throw him out with wondrous potency .
for this same lord , i do repent ; but propn hath pleas 'd it so , to punish me with this , and this with me , that i must be their scourge and minister .
i will bestow him , and will answer well the death i gave him .
so again , good night .
one word more , good lady .
what shall i do ?
twere good you let him know ; for who that 's but a queen , fair , sober , wise , would from a paddock , from a bat , a gib such dear concernings hide ?
who would do so ?
no , in despite of sense and secrecy , propn the basket on the house 's top , let the birds fly , and like the famous ape , to try conclusions , in the basket creep and break your own neck down .
be thou assur 'd , if words be made of breath , and breath of life , i have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me .
i must to propn ; you know that ?
propn , i had forgot !
let it work ; for ' tis the sport to have the enginer propn with his own petar ; and ' shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon .
o , ' tis most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet .
mother , good night .
indeed , this counsellor is now most still , most secret , and most grave , who was in life a foolish prating knave .
come , sir , to draw toward an end with you .
good night , mother .
there 's matter in these sighs .
where is your son ?
bestow this place on us a little while .
ah , mine own lord , what have i seen tonight !
what , propn ?
how does propn ?
mad as the sea and wind when both contend which is the mightier .
in his lawless fit , behind the arras hearing something stir , propn out his rapier , cries ' a rat , a rat !
and in this brainish apprehension kills the unseen good old man .
o heavy deed !
it had been so with us , had we been there .
his liberty is full of threats to all , to you yourself , to us , to every one .
alas , how shall this bloody deed be answer 'd ?
it will be laid to us , whose providence should have kept short , restrain 'd , and out of haunt this mad young man .
but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit , but , like the owner of a foul disease , to keep it from divulging , let it feed even on the pith of life .
where is he gone ?
he weeps for what is done .
o propn , come away !
propn , guildenstern !
friends both , go join you with some further aid .
propn in madness hath propn slain , and from his mother 's closet hath he dragg 'd him .
go seek him out ; speak fair , and bring the body into the chapel .
i pray you haste in this .
come , propn , we 'll call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and what 's untimely done .
so haply slander propn whisper o'er the world 's diameter , as level as the cannon to his blank , transports his poisoned shot , may miss our name and hit the woundless air .— o , come away !
my soul is full of discord and dismay .
safely stow 'd .
propn !
propn propn !
what noise ?
who calls on propn ?
o , here they come .
what have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
compounded it with dust , whereto ' tis kin .
tell us where ' tis , that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel .
do not believe it .
believe what ?
that i can keep your counsel , and not mine own .
take you me for a sponge , my lord ?
ay , sir ; that soaks up the propn 's countenance , his rewards , his authorities .
but such officers do the propn best service in the end .
he keeps them , like an ape , in the corner of his jaw ; first mouth 'd , to be last swallowed .
when he needs what you have glean 'd , it is but squeezing you and , sponge , you shall be dry again .
i understand you not , my lord .
i am glad of it .
a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear .
my lord , you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the propn .
the body is with the propn , but the propn is not with the body .
the propn is a thing— a thing , my lord ?
of nothing .
bring me to him .
hide fox , and all after .
i have sent to seek him , and to find the body .
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose !
yet must not we put the strong law on him .
he 's loved of the distracted multitude , who like not in their judgment , but their eyes ; and where ' tis so , the offender 's scourge is weigh 'd , but never the offence .
to bear all smooth and even , this sudden sending him away must seem propn pause .
diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved , or not at all .
where the dead body is bestow 'd , my lord , we can not get from him .
but where is he ?
without , my lord ; guarded , to know your pleasure .
bring him before us .
propn , guildenstern !
bring in my lord .
now , propn , where 's propn ?
at supper .
at supper ?
where ?
not where he eats , but where he is eaten .
a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him .
your worm is your only emperor for diet .
we fat all creatures else to fat us , and we fat ourselves for maggots .
your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service , two dishes , but to one table .
that 's the end .
alas , alas !
a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king , and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm .
what dost thou mean by this ?
nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar .
where is propn ?
in propn .
send thither to see .
if your messenger find him not there , seek him i ' the other place yourself .
but indeed , if you find him not within this month , you shall nose him as you go up the stair , into the lobby .
go seek him there .
he will stay till you come .
propn , this deed , for thine especial safety— which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done — must send thee hence with fiery quickness .
for propn ?
ay , propn .
good .
so is it , if thou knew'st our purposes .
i see a cherub that sees them .
but come , for propn !
propn , dear mother .
thy loving father , propn .
my mother !
propn and mother is man and wife ; man and wife is one flesh ; and so , my mother .
come , for propn !
delay it not ; i 'll have him hence tonight .
away !
for every thing is seal 'd and done that else leans on the affair .
pray you , make haste .
and , propn , if my love thou hold'st at aught— as my great power thereof may give thee sense , since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword , and thy free awe propn homage to us — thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process , which imports at full , by letters congruing to that effect , the present death of propn .
do it , propn ; for like the hectic in my blood he rages , and thou must cure me .
till i know ' tis done , howe'er my haps , my joys were ne'er begun .
go , captain , from me greet the danish king .
tell him that by his license propn propn the conveyance of a promised march over his kingdom .
you know the rendezvous .
if that his propn would aught with us , we shall express our duty in his eye ; and let him know so .
i will do't , my lord .
go softly on .
good sir , whose powers are these ?
they are of propn , sir .
how purposed , sir , i pray you ?
against some part of propn .
who commands them , sir ?
the nephew to old propn , propn .
goes it against the main of propn , sir , or for some frontier ?
truly to speak , and with no addition , we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name .
to pay five ducats , five , i would not farm it ; nor will it yield to propn or the propn propn ranker rate , should it be sold in fee .
why , then the propn never will defend it .
yes , it is already garrison 'd .
two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw .
this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace , that inward breaks , and shows no cause without why the man dies .
i humbly thank you , sir .
propn be wi ' you , sir .
will't please you go , my lord ?
i 'll be with you straight .
go a little before .
how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge !
what is a man , if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed ?
a beast , no more .
sure , he that made us with such large discourse , looking before and after , gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused .
now , whether it be bestial oblivion , or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on the event— a thought which , quarter 'd , hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward — i do not know why yet i live to say ' this thing 's to do , ' sith i have cause , and will , and strength , and means to do't .
examples gross as earth exhort me .
witness this army , of such mass and charge , led by a delicate and tender prince , whose spirit with divine ambition puff 'd , makes mouths at the invisible event , exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune , death , and danger dare , even for an eggshell .
rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument , but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour 's at the stake .
how stand i then , that have a father kill 'd , a mother stain 'd , excitements of my reason and my blood , and let all sleep , while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds , fight for a plot propn the numbers can not try the cause , which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain ?
o , from this time forth , my thoughts be bloody , or be nothing worth !
i will not speak with her .
she is importunate , indeed distract .
her mood will needs be pitied .
what would she have ?
she speaks much of her father ; says she hears there 's tricks i ' the world , and hems , and beats her heart ; propn enviously at straws ; speaks things in doubt , that carry but half sense .
her speech is nothing , yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection ; they aim at it , and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts ; which , as her winks and nods and gestures yield them , indeed would make one think there might be thought , though nothing sure , yet much unhappily .
twere good she were spoken with ; for she may strew dangerous conjectures in ill - breeding minds .
let her come in .
to my sick soul , as sin 's true nature is , each toy seems prologue to some great amiss .
so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt .
where is the beauteous propn of propn ?
how should i your true love know from another one ?
by his cockle hat and staff and his sandal shoon .
alas , sweet lady , what imports this song ?
say you ?
nay , pray you , mark .
he is dead and gone , lady , he is dead and gone ; at his head a grass - green turf , at his heels a stone .
nay , but ophelia— pray you , mark .
propn his shroud as the mountain snow— propn , look here , my lord !
larded all with sweet flowers ; which bewept to the grave did not go with true - love showers .
how do you , pretty lady ?
well , propn ' eild you !
they say the owl was a baker 's daughter .
propn , we know what we are , but know not what we may be .
propn be at your table !
conceit upon her father .
then up he rose and donn 'd his clo'es and dupp 'd the chamber door , let in the maid , that out a maid never departed more .
propn propn !
indeed , without an oath , i 'll make an end o n't !
by propn and by propn propn , propn , and fie for shame !
young men will do't if they come propn by propn , they are to blame .
how long hath she been thus ?
i hope all will be well .
we must be patient .
but i can- not choose but weep , to think they would lay him i ' the cold ground .
my brother shall know of it .
and so i thank you for your good counsel .
come , my coach !
follow her close ; give her good watch , i pray you .
o , this is the poison of deep grief ; it springs all from her father 's death .
o my dear propn , this , like to a murdering - piece , in many places gives me superfluous death .
propn , what noise is this ?
where are my switzers ?
let them guard the door .
what is the matter ?
save yourself , my lord .
the ocean , overpeering of his list , eats not the flats with more impetuous haste than young propn , in a riotous head , o'erbears your offices .
the rabble call him lord ; and , as the world were now but to begin , propn forgot , custom not propn the ratifiers and props of every word— they cry ' choose we !
o , this is counter , you false danish dogs !
the doors are broke .
where is this propn ?
sirs , stand you all without .
no , let 's come in !
i pray you give me leave .
we will , we will !
i thank you .
keep the door .
o thou vile king , give me my father !
calmly , good propn .
that drop of blood that 's calm proclaims me bastard ; cries cuckold to my father ; brands the harlot even here , between the chaste unsmirched brows of my true mother .
what is the cause , propn , that thy rebellion looks so giant - like ?
there 's such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would , acts little of his will .
tell me , propn , why thou art thus incensed .
let him go , propn .
speak , man .
where is my father ?
dead .
but not by him !
how came he dead ?
propn , to the blackest devil !
conscience and grace , to the profoundest pit !
i dare damnation .
who shall stay you ?
my will , not all the world !
and for my means , i 'll husband them so well , they shall go far with little .
propn propn , if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father 's death , is't writ in your revenge that , swoopstake , you will draw both friend and foe , propn and loser ?
none but his enemies .
will you know them then ?
to his good friends thus wide i 'll ope my arms and , like the kind life - rendering pelican , propn them with my blood .
why , now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman .
that i am guiltless of your father 's death , and am most sensibly in grief for it , it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye .
let her come in .
how now ?
what noise is that ?
o heat , dry up my brains !
tears seven times salt , burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
dear maid , kind sister , sweet propn !
o heavens !
is't possible a young maid 's wits should be as mortal as an old man 's life ?
nature is fine in love , and where ' tis fine , it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves .
they bore him barefac 'd on the bier ( hey non nony , nony , hey nony ) and on his grave rain 'd many a tear .
fare you well , my dove !
propn thou thy wits , and didst persuade revenge , it could not move thus .
it is the false stew- ard , that stole his master 's daughter .
this nothing 's more than matter .
there 's fennel for you , and columbines .
there 's rue for you , and here 's some for me .
there 's a daisy .
i would give you some violets , but they with- propn all when my father died .
and will he not come again ?
and will he not come again ?
no , no , he is dead ; go to thy deathbed ; he never will come again .
his beard was as white as snow , all flaxen was his poll .
he is gone , he is gone , and we cast away moan .
propn ' a'mercy on his soul !
and of all christian souls , i pray propn .
propn be wi ' you .
do you see this , o propn ?
laertes , i must commune with your grief , or you deny me right .
go but apart , make choice of whom your wisest friends you will , and they shall hear and judge ' twixt you and me .
if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touch 'd , we will our kingdom give , our crown , our life , and all that we call ours , to you in satisfaction ; but if not , be you content to lend your patience to us , and we shall jointly labour with your soul to give it due content .
his means of death , his obscure burial— no trophy , sword , nor hatchment o'er his bones , no noble rite nor formal ostentation , cry to be heard , as ' twere from propn to earth , that i must call't in question .
so you shall ; and where the offence is let the great axe fall .
i pray you go with me .
what are they that would speak with me ?
seafaring men , sir .
they say they have letters for you .
let them come in .
i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted , if not from propn propn .
propn bless you , sir .
let him bless thee too .
he shall , sir , a n't please him .
propn , when thou shalt have overlook 'd this , give these fellows some means to the propn .
they have letters for him .
propn we were two days old at sea , a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase .
finding ourselves too slow of sail , we put on a compelled valour , and in the grapple i boarded them .
on the instant they got clear of our ship ; so i alone became their prisoner .
let the propn have the letters i have sent , and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death .
i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb ; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter .
these good fellows will bring thee where i am .
propn and propn hold their course for propn .
of them i have much to tell thee .
propn .
he that thou knowest thine , propn .
come , i will give you way for these your letters , and do't the speedier that you may direct me to him from whom you brought them .
now must your conscience my acquittance seal , and you must put me in your heart for friend , propn you have heard , and with a knowing ear , that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life .
it well appears .
but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so crimeful and so capital in nature , as by your safety , wisdom , all things else , you mainly were stirr 'd up .
o , for two special reasons , which may to you , perhaps , seem much unsinew 'd , but yet to me they are strong .
the propn his mother lives almost by his looks ; and for myself— my virtue or my plague , be it either which— she 's so conjunctive to my life and soul that , as the star moves not but in his sphere , i could not but by her .
the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him , who , dipping all his faults in their affection , would , like the spring that turneth wood to stone , convert his gyves to graces ; so that my arrows , too slightly timber 'd for so loud a wind , would have reverted to my bow again , and not where i had aim 'd them .
and so have i a noble father lost ; a sister driven into desperate terms , whose worth , if praises may go back again , stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections .
but my revenge will come .
break not your sleeps for that .
you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger , and think it pastime .
you shortly shall hear more .
what news ?
letters , my lord , from propn .
this to your propn ; this to the propn .
from propn ?
who brought them ?
sailors , my lord , they say ; i saw them not .
laertes , you shall hear them .
leave us .
high and mighty , you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom .
what should this mean ?
are all the rest come back ?
or is it some abuse , and no such thing ?
know you the hand ?
propn propn 's character .
i 'm lost in it , my lord .
but let him come .
how otherwise ? — will you be ruled by me ?
ay my lord , so you will not o'errule me to a peace .
to thine own peace .
it falls right .
you have been talk 'd of since your travel much , and that in propn 's hearing , for a quality propn they say you shine .
your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one ; and that , in my regard , of the unworthiest siege .
what part is that , my lord ?
a very ribbon in the cap of youth , yet needful too ; for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds , importing health and graveness .
two months since here was a gentleman of propn i have seen myself , and served against , the propn , and they can well on horseback ; but this gallant had witchcraft i n't .
he grew unto his seat , and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been incorpsed and demi - natured with the brave beast .
so far he topp 'd my thought that i , in forgery of shapes and tricks , come short of what he did .
a propn was't ?
a propn .
upon my life , propn .
the very same .
i know him well .
he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation .
propn , this report of his did propn so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er to play with you .
laertes , was your father dear to you ?
not that i think you did not love your father , but that i know love is begun by time , and that i see , in passages of proof , propn qualifies the spark and fire of it .
there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it ; and nothing is at a like goodness still ; for goodness , growing to a pleurisy , propn in his own too much .
that we would do , we should do when we would ; for this ' would ' changes , and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues , are hands , are accidents ; and then this ' should ' is like a spendthrift sigh , that hurts by easing .
but to the quick o ' the ulcer !
propn comes back .
what would you undertake to show yourself your father 's son in deed more than in words ?
to cut his throat i ' the church .
no place indeed should murder sanctuarize ; revenge should have no bounds .
propn return 'd shall know you are come home .
we 'll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the propn gave you , bring you in fine together and wager on your heads .
he , being remiss , most generous and free from all contriving , will not peruse the foils ; so that with ease , or with a little shuffling , you may choose a sword unbated , and in a pass of practice , requite him for your father .
i will do't !
and for that purpose i 'll anoint my sword .
i bought an unction of a mountebank , so mortal that but dip a knife in it , where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare , collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon , can save the thing from death this is but scratch 'd withal .
i 'll touch my point with this contagion , that , if i gall him slightly , it may be death .
therefore this project should have a back or second , that might hold if this did blast in proof .
soft !
let me see .
we 'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings— i ha't !
when in your motion you are hot and dry— as make your bouts more violent to that end— and that he calls for drink , i 'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce ; whereon but sipping , if he by chance escape your venom 'd stuck , our purpose may hold there .
how now , sweet propn ?
one woe doth tread upon another 's heel , so fast they follow .
your sister 's drown 'd , propn .
drown 'd !
o , where ?
alas , then she is drown 'd ?
drown 'd , drown 'd .
too much of water hast thou , poor propn , and therefore i forbid my tears ; but yet it is our trick ; nature her custom holds , let shame say what it will .
when these are gone , the woman will be out .
propn , my lord .
i have a speech of fire , that fain would blaze but that this folly drowns it .
let 's follow , propn .
how much i had to do to calm his rage .
now fear i this will give it start again ; therefore let 's follow .
is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation ?
i tell thee she is ; therefore make her grave straight .
the crowner hath sat on her , and finds it christian burial .
how can that be , unless she drown 'd herself in her own defence ?
why , ' tis found so .
it must be se offendendo ; it can not be else .
for se offendendo ; it can not be else .
here lies the water — good .
here stands the man — good .
but is this law ?
ay , marry , is't ; crowner 's quest law .
will you ha ' the truth o n't ?
if this had not been a gentlewoman , she should have been buried out o ' christian burial .
why , there thou say'st !
and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even christian .
come , my spade !
there is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners , ditchers , and grave - makers .
they hold up propn 's profession .
was he a gentleman ?
a was the first that ever bore arms .
why , he had none .
what , art a heathen ?
how dost thou under- stand the scripture ?
the scripture says propn digged .
could he dig without arms ?
i 'll put another question to thee .
the gallows - maker ; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants .
i like thy wit well , in good faith .
to't again , come !
who builds stronger than a mason , a ship- wright , or a carpenter ?
ay , tell me that , and unyoke .
marry , now i can tell !
to't .
mass , i can not tell .
go , get thee in propn ; fetch me a stoup of liquor .
in youth when i did love , did love , methought it was very sweet ; to contract — o — the time for — a — my behove , o , methought there — a — was nothing — a meet .
has this fellow no feeling of his business , that he sings at grave - making ?
custom hath made it in him a property of easiness .
tis e'en so .
the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense .
but age with his stealing steps propn clawed me in his clutch , and hath shipped me intil the land , as if i had never been such .
that skull had a tongue in it , and could sing once .
how the knave jowls it to the ground , as if ' were propn 's jawbone , that did the first murder !
this might be the pate of a politician , which this ass now o'erreaches ; one that would circumvent propn , might it not ?
it might , my lord .
or of a courtier , which could say ' good morrow , sweet lord !
how dost thou , sweet lord ?
this might be my propn such - a- one , that praised my propn such - a - one 's horse when he meant to beg it , might it not ?
ay , my lord .
why , e'en so !
and now my propn propn 's , chapless , and knock 'd about the mazard with a sexton 's spade .
here 's fine revolution , and we had the trick to see't .
did these bones cost no more the breeding , but to play at loggets with 'em ?
mine ache to think o n't .
a pickaxe and a spade , a spade , for and a shrouding sheet ; o , a propn of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet .
there 's another .
why may not that be the skull of a lawyer ?
where be his quiddities now , his quillets , his cases , his tenures , and his tricks ?
why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel , and will not tell him of his action of battery ?
hum !
this fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land , with his statutes , his recognizances , his fines , his double vouchers , his recoveries .
is this the fine of his fines , and the recovery of his recoveries , to have his fine pate full of fine dirt ?
will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases , and double ones too , than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures ?
the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box ; and must the inheritor himself have no more , ha ?
not a jot more , my lord .
is not parchment made of sheepskins ?
ay , my lord , and of calveskins too .
they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that .
i will speak to this fellow .
whose grave 's this , sir- rah ?
mine , sir .
o , a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet .
i think it be thine indeed , for thou liest i n't .
you lie out o n't , sir , and therefore ' tis not yours .
for my part , i do not lie propn , yet it is mine .
thou dost lie i n't , to be i n't and say it ' ' tis thine .
tis for the dead , not for the quick ; therefore thou liest .
tis a quick lie , sir ; ' twill away again from me to you .
what man dost thou dig it for ?
for no man , sir .
what woman then ?
for none , neither .
who is to be buried i n't ?
one that was a woman , sir ; but , rest her soul , she 's dead .
how absolute the knave is !
we must speak by the card , or equivocation will undo us .
by the propn , propn , this three years i have taken note of it , the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe .
how long hast thou been a grave - maker ?
of all the days i ' the year , i came propn that day that our last king propn overcame propn .
how long is that since ?
can not you tell that ?
every fool can tell that .
it was the very day that young propn was born — he that is mad , and sent into propn .
ay , marry , why was he sent into propn ?
a shall recover his wits there ; or , if a do not , ' tis no great matter there .
why ?
propn not he seen in him there .
there the men are as mad as he .
how came he mad ?
very strangely , they say .
how ' strangely ' ?
faith , e'en with losing his wits .
upon what ground ?
why , here in propn .
i have been sexton here , man and boy , thirty years .
how long will a man lie i ' the earth ere he rot ?
i ' faith , if he be not rotten before he die — as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in — he will last you some eight year or nine year .
a tanner will last you nine year .
why he more than another ?
why , sir , his hide is so tanned with his trade that a will keep out water a great while ; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body .
here 's a skull , now .
this skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty years .
whose was it ?
a whoreson , mad fellow 's it was .
whose do you think it was ?
nay , i know not .
a pestilence on him for a mad rogue !
a poured a flagon of propn on my head once .
this same skull , sir , was propn 's skull , the propn 's jester .
this ?
e'en that .
alas , poor propn !
i knew him , horatio : a fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy .
my gorge rises at it .
here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft .
where be your gibes now ?
your gambols ?
your songs ?
your flashes of merriment , that were wo nt to set the table on a roar ?
not one now to mock your own grinning ?
quite chop - fallen ?
prithee , propn , tell me one thing .
what 's that , my lord ?
dost thou think propn looked o ' this fashion i ' the earth ?
propn !
e'en so , my lord .
to what base uses we may return , propn !
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of propn till he find it stopping a bung - hole ?
twere to consider too curiously , to consider so .
propn propn , dead and turn 'd to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
o , that that earth , which kept the world in awe should patch a wall to expel the winter 's flaw !
but soft !
who is this they follow ?
and with such maimed rites ?
this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand propn it own life .
propn of some estate .
couch we awhile , and mark .
what ceremony else ?
that is propn , a very noble youth .
propn .
what ceremony else ?
her obsequies have been as far enlarged as we have warranty .
must there no more be done ?
lay her i ' the earth ; and from her fair and unpolluted flesh propn violets spring !
i tell thee , churlish priest , a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling .
what , the fair propn ?
sweets to the sweet !
propn .
i hoped thou shouldst have been my propn 's wife ; i thought thy bride - bed to have deck 'd , sweet maid , and not have strew 'd thy grave .
o , treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of !
hold off the earth awhile , till i have caught her once more in mine arms .
now pile your dust upon the quick and dead till of this flat a mountain you have made to o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue propn .
this is i , propn the propn .
the devil take thy soul !
thou pray'st not well .
i prithee , take thy fingers from my throat ; for , though i am not splenitive and rash , yet have i in me something dangerous , which let thy wisdom fear .
hold off thy hand !
propn them asunder .
gentlemen !
good my lord , be quiet .
why , i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag .
o my son , what theme ?
i loved propn .
forty thousand brothers could not , with all their quantity of love , make up my sum .
what wilt thou do for her ?
o , he is mad , propn .
for love of propn , forbear him !
swounds , show me what thou'lt do .
i 'll do't .
be buried quick with her , and so will i .
and , if thou prate of mountains , let them throw millions of acres on us , till our ground , singeing his pate against the burning zone , make ossa like a wart !
nay , an thou'lt mouth , i 'll rant as well as thou .
propn , as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclosed , his silence will sit drooping .
i loved you ever .
but it is no matter .
let propn himself do what he may , the cat will mew , and dog will have his day .
we 'll put the matter to the present push.— propn propn , set some watch over your son .
this grave shall have a living monument .
so much for this , sir ; now shall you see the other .
you do remember all the circumstance ?
remember it , my lord !
propn , in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep .
methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes .
such bugs and goblins in my life , that on the supervise , no leisure bated , no , not to stay the grinding of the axe , my head should be struck off .
is't possible ?
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed ?
i beseech you .
being thus benetted round with villainies— or i could make a prologue to my brains , they had begun the play — i sat me down , devised a new commission , wrote it fair .
i once did hold it , as our statists do , a baseness to write fair , and labour 'd much how to forget that learning ; but , sir , now it did me yeoman 's service .
wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote ?
ay , good my lord .
an earnest conjuration from the propn , as propn was his faithful tributary , as love between them like the palm might flourish , as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma ' tween their amities , and many such like as 's of great charge , that on the view and knowing of these contents , without debatement further , more or less , he should the bearers put to sudden death , not shriving - time allow 'd .
how was this seal 'd ?
why , even in that was propn ordinant .
now , the next day was our sea - fight ; and what to this was sequent propn propn already .
so propn and propn go propn .
why , man , they did make love to this employment !
they are not near my conscience ; their defeat does by their own insinuation grow .
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites .
why , what a king is this !
does it not , think thee , stand me now upon— he that hath kill 'd my king , and whored my mother ; popp 'd in between the election and my hopes ; thrown out his angle for my proper life , and with such cozenage — is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm ?
and is't not to be damn 'd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil ?
it will be short ; the interim is mine , and a man 's life 's is no more than to say ' one .
but i am very sorry , good propn , that to propn i forgot myself , for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his .
i 'll court his favours .
but , sure , the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion .
peace , who comes here ?
your lordship is right welcome back to propn .
i humbly thank you , sir .
dost know this water - fly ?
no , my good lord .
thy state is the more gracious ; for ' tis a vice to know him .
he hath much land , and fertile .
let a beast be lord of beasts , and his crib shall stand at the king 's mess .
tis a chough ; but , as i say , spacious in the pos- session of dirt .
sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , i should impart a thing to you from his propn .
i will receive it , sir , with all diligence of spirit .
put your bonnet to his right use .
tis for the head .
i thank your lordship , it is very hot .
no , believe me , ' tis very cold ; the wind is northerly .
it is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
exceedingly , my lord ; it is very sultry , as ' twere — i can- not tell how .
but , my lord , his propn bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head .
propn , here is newly come to court laertes ; believe me , an absolute gentleman , full of most excellent differences , of very soft society and great showing .
indeed , to speak feelingly of him , he is the card or calendar of gentry ; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gen- tleman would see .
propn , his definement suffers no perdition in you ; though , i know , to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail .
but , in the verity of extolment , i take him to be a soul of great article , and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as , to make true diction of him , his semblable is his mirror , and who else would trace him , his umbrage , nothing more .
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
the concernancy , sir ?
why do we wrap the gen- tleman in our more rawer breath ?
propn ?
is't not possible to understand in another tongue ?
you will to't , sir , really .
what imports the nomination of this gentleman ?
of propn ?
of him , sir .
well , sir ?
i mean , sir , for his weapon ; but in the imputation laid on him by them , in his meed he 's unfellowed .
what 's his weapon ?
rapier and dagger .
that 's two of his weapons .
but , well .
what call you the carriages ?
i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done .
the carriages , sir , are the hangers .
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides .
i would it might be hangers till then .
but on !
why is this ' impawned , ' as you call it ?
how if i answer no ?
i mean , my lord , the opposition of your person in trial .
propn , i will walk here in the hall .
if it please his propn , it is the breathing time of day with me .
shall i redeliver you e'en so ?
to this effect , sir , after what flourish your nature will .
i commend my duty to your lordship .
yours , yours .
he does well to commend it himself ; there are no tongues else for 's turn .
this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head .
he did comply with his dug before he sucked it .
thus has he — and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on — only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter , a kind of yesty collection , which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions ; and do but blow them to their trial , the bubbles are out .
my lord , his propn commended him to you by propn propn , who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall .
he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with propn , or that you will take longer time .
i am constant to my purposes ; they follow the propn 's pleasure .
if his fitness speaks , mine is ready ; now or when- soever , provided i be so able as now .
the propn and propn and all are coming down .
in happy time .
the propn desires you to use some gentle entertainment to propn before you fall to play .
she well instructs me .
you will lose this wager , my lord .
i do not think so .
since he went into propn i have been in continual practice .
i shall win at the odds .
but thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here about my heart .
but it is no matter .
nay , good my lord— it is but foolery ; but it is such a kind of gain - giving as would perhaps trouble a woman .
if your mind dislike anything , obey it .
the readiness is all .
since no man has aught of what he leaves , what is't to leave betimes ?
come , propn , come , and take this hand from me .
give me your pardon , sir .
this presence knows , and you must needs have heard , how i am punish 'd with sore distraction .
what i have done that might your nature , honour , and exception roughly awake , i here proclaim was madness .
propn propn wrong 'd propn ?
never propn .
who does it , then ?
his madness .
propn , in this audience , let my disclaiming from a purposed evil propn me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother .
i am satisfied in nature , whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge .
but in my terms of honour i stand aloof , and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungor 'd .
but till that time i do receive your offer 'd love like love , and will not wrong it .
i embrace it freely , and will this brother 's wager frankly play.— give us the foils .
come on .
come , one for me .
i 'll be your foil , propn .
in mine ignorance your skill shall , like a star i ' the darkest night , propn fiery off indeed .
you mock me , sir .
no , by this hand .
give them the foils , propn propn .
propn propn , you know the wager ?
i do not fear it , i have seen you both ; but since he is better 'd , we have therefore odds .
this likes me well .
these foils have all a length ?
ay , my good lord .
set me the stoups of wine upon that table .
if propn give the first or second hit , or quit in answer of the third exchange , let all the battlements their ordnance fire ; the propn shall drink to propn 's better breath , and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in propn 's crown have worn .
give me the cups ; and let the kettle to the trumpet speak , the trumpet to the cannoneer without , the cannons to the heavens , the propn to earth , ‘ now the propn drinks to hamlet. ’ come , begin .
and you the judges , bear a wary eye .
come on , sir .
come , my lord .
one .
no .
judgment !
a hit , a very palpable hit .
well , again !
stay , give me drink .
propn , this pearl is thine ; here 's to thy health .
give him the cup .
i 'll play this bout first ; set it by awhile .
come .
a touch , a touch ; i do confess .
our son shall win .
he 's fat , and scant of breath .
the propn carouses to thy fortune , propn .
good madam !
propn , do not drink .
i will , my lord ; i pray you pardon me .
it is the poison 'd cup ; it is too late .
i dare not drink yet , madam — by - and - by .
come , let me wipe thy face .
my lord , i 'll hit him now .
i do not think't .
and yet it is almost against my conscience .
come for the third , propn !
say you so ?
come on .
nothing , neither way .
have at you now !
part them !
they are incensed .
look to the propn there , ho !
they bleed on both sides .
how is it , my lord ?
how is't , propn ?
why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , propn .
i am justly kill 'd with mine own treachery .
how does the propn ?
she swoons to see them bleed .
no , no !
i am poison 'd .
o villainy !
ho !
let the door be lock 'd .
treachery !
seek it out .
it is here , propn .
propn , thou art slain ; no medicine in the world can do thee good .
the foul practice propn turn 'd itself on me .
propn , here i lie , never to rise again .
propn mother 's poison 'd .
i can no more .
the propn , the propn 's to blame .
the point envenom 'd too !
then , venom , to thy work .
treason !
treason !
o , yet defend me , friends !
i am but hurt .
here , thou incestuous , murderous , damned propn , drink off this potion !
is thy union here ?
follow my mother .
exchange forgiveness with me , noble propn .
mine and my father 's death come not upon thee , nor thine on me !
propn make thee free of it !
i follow thee .
i am dead , propn .
propn propn , adieu !
never believe it .
i am more an antique propn a propn .
here 's yet some liquor left .
o propn , propn , what a wounded name , things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart , absent thee from felicity awhile , and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain , to tell my story .
what warlike noise is this ?
propn propn , with conquest come from propn , to the ambassadors of propn gives this warlike volley .
i can not live to hear the news from propn , but i do prophesy the election lights on propn .
now cracks a noble heart .
good night , sweet prince , and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest !
why does the drum come hither ?
where is this sight ?
what is it you will see ?
if aught of woe or wonder , cease your search .
this quarry cries on havoc .
o proud death , what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck ?
the sight is dismal ; and our affairs from propn come too late .
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfill 'd that propn and propn are dead .
where should we have our thanks ?
not from his mouth , had it the ability of life to thank you .
he never gave commandment for their death .
but since , so jump upon this bloody question , you from the propn wars , and you from propn , are here arrived , give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view ; and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about .
so shall you hear of carnal , bloody and unnatural acts ; of accidental judgments , casual slaughters ; of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause ; and , in this upshot , purposes mistook fall'n on the inventors ' heads .
all this can i truly deliver .
let us haste to hear it , and call the noblest to the audience .
for me , with sorrow i embrace my fortune .
i have some rights of memory in this kingdom , which now , to claim my vantage doth invite me .
of that i shall have also cause to speak , and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more .
but let this same be presently perform 'd , even while men 's minds are wild , lest more mischance on plots and errors happen .
let four captains propn propn like a soldier to the stage ; for he was likely , had he been put on , to have proved most royal ; and , for his passage , the soldiers ' music and the rites of war speak loudly for him .
take up the bodies .
hence !
home , you idle creatures , get you home .
why , sir , a carpenter .
where is thy leather apron and thy rule ?
truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , i am but , as you would say , a cobbler .
but what trade art thou ?
answer me directly .
a trade , sir , that , i hope , i may use with a safe con- science , which is indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .
what trade , thou knave ?
thou naughty knave , what trade ?
nay , i beseech you , sir , be not out with me ; yet , if you be out , sir , i can mend you .
what mean'st thou by that ?
mend me , thou saucy- fellow !
why , sir , cobble you .
thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
propn , propn , all that i live by is with the awl ; i meddle with no tradesman 's matters , nor women 's matters , but with awl .
i am indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes ; when they are in great danger , i recover them .
as proper men as ever trod upon neats - leather have gone upon my handiwork .
but wherefore art not in thy shop today ?
why dost thou lead these men about the streets ?
truly , sir , to wear out their shoes , to get myself into more work .
but indeed , sir , we make holiday , to see propn and to rejoice in his triumph .
wherefore rejoice ?
what conquest brings he home ?
what tributaries follow him to propn , to grace in captive bonds his chariot - wheels ?
you blocks , you stones , you worse than senseless things !
o you hard hearts , you cruel men of propn , propn you not pompey ?
many a time and oft have you climb 'd up to walls and battlements , to towers and windows , yea , to chimney tops , your infants in your arms , and there have sat the live - long day with patient expectation to see great propn pass the streets of propn .
and when you saw his chariot but appear , have you not made an universal shout , that propn trembled underneath her banks to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores ?
and do you now put on your best attire ?
and do you now cull out a holiday ?
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over propn 's blood ?
be gone !
run to your houses , fall upon your knees , pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude .
go , go , good countrymen , and , for this fault , assemble all the poor men of your sort , draw them to propn banks , and weep your tears into the channel , till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all .
see , whether their basest metal be not moved ; they vanish tongue - tied in their guiltiness .
go you down that way towards the propn ; this way will propn propn the images , if you do find them deck 'd with ceremonies .
may we do so ?
you know it is the feast of lupercal .
it is no matter ; let no images be hung with propn 's trophies .
i 'll about , and drive away the vulgar from the streets ; so do you too , where you perceive them thick .
propn speaks .
stand you directly in propn 's way , when he doth run his course .
i shall remember .
when propn says “ do this , ” it is perform 'd .
set on , and leave no ceremony out .
propn !
ha !
who calls ?
peace yet again !
who is it in the press that calls on me ?
i hear a tongue , shriller than all the music , cry “ propn . ” propn , propn is turn 'd to hear .
beware the ides of propn .
what man is that ?
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of propn .
set him before me ; let me see his face .
propn , come from the throng ; look upon propn .
what say'st thou to me now ?
speak once again .
beware the ides of propn .
he is a dreamer ; let us leave him .
pass .
will you go see the order of the course ?
i am not gamesome ; i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in propn .
let me not hinder , propn , your desires ; i 'll leave you .
propn , i do observe you now of late ; i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wo nt to have ; you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you .
vexed i am of late with passions of some difference , propn only proper to myself , which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors ; but let not therefore my good friends be grieved— among which number , propn , be you one— nor construe any further my neglect than that poor propn with himself at war propn the shows of love to other men .
then , propn , i have much mistook your passion , by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value , worthy cogitations .
tell me , good propn , can you see your face ?
no , propn , for the eye sees not itself but by reflection , by some other things .
propn just , and it is very much lamented , propn , that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow .
i have heard where many of the best respect in propn , except immortal propn , speaking of propn , and groaning underneath this age 's yoke , have wish 'd that noble propn had his eyes .
into what dangers would you lead me , propn , that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me ?
therefore , good propn , be prepared to hear , and since you know you can not see yourself so well as by reflection , i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of .
and be not jealous on me , gentle propn ; were i a common laugher , or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester , if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them , or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
what means this shouting ?
i do fear the people propn propn for their king .
ay , do you fear it ?
then must i think you would not have it so .
what is it that you would impart to me ?
i know that virtue to be in you , propn , as well as i do know your outward favor .
well , honor is the subject of my story .
i can not tell what you and other men think of this life , but , for my single self , i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself .
so indeed he did .
and this man is now become a god , and propn is a wretched creature , and must bend his body if propn carelessly but nod on him .
he had a fever when he was in propn , and when the fit was on him , i did mark how he did shake .
i did hear him groan .
another general shout !
i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heap 'd on propn .
why , man , he doth bestride the narrow world like a propn , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves .
propn , and propn : what should be in that propn ?
why should that name be sounded more than yours ?
write them together , yours is as fair a name ; sound them , it doth become the mouth as well ; weigh them , it is as heavy ; conjure with 'em , propn will start a spirit as soon as propn .
now , in the names of all the gods at once , upon what meat doth this our propn feed that he is grown so great ?
age , thou art shamed !
propn , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man ?
when could they say till now that talk 'd of propn that her wide walls encompass 'd but one man ?
now is it propn indeed , and room enough , when there is in it but one only man .
o , you and i have heard our fathers say there was a propn once that would have propn the eternal devil to keep his state in propn as easily as a king .
that you do love me , i am nothing jealous ; what you would work me to , i have some aim .
how i have thought of this and of these times , i shall recount hereafter ; for this present , i would not , so with love i might entreat you , be any further moved .
what you have said i will consider ; what you have to say i will with patience hear , and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things .
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from propn .
the games are done , and propn is returning .
as they pass by , pluck propn by the sleeve , and he will , after his sour fashion , tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today .
but , look you , propn , the angry spot doth glow on propn 's brow , and all the rest look like a chidden train : propn 's cheek is pale , and propn looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the propn , being cross 'd in conference by some senators .
propn will tell us what the matter is .
propn ?
fear him not , propn ; he 's not dangerous ; he is a noble roman and well given .
would he were fatter !
he reads much , he is a great observer , and he looks quite through the deeds of men .
such men as he be never at heart 's ease propn they behold a greater than themselves , and therefore are they very dangerous .
i rather tell thee what is to be fear 'd than what i fear , for always i am propn .
come on my right hand , for this ear is deaf , and tell me truly what thou think'st of him .
you pull 'd me by the cloak ; would you speak with me ?
ay , propn , tell us what hath chanced today , that propn looks so sad .
why , you were with him , were you not ?
i should not then ask propn what had chanced .
why , there was a crown offered him , and being offered him : he put it by with the back of his hand , thus , and then the people fell a - shouting .
what was the second noise for ?
why , for that too .
they shouted thrice .
what was the last cry for ?
why , for that too .
was the crown offered him thrice ?
ay , marry , wast , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted .
who offered him the crown ?
why , propn .
tell us the manner of it , gentle propn .
i can as well be hang 'd as tell the manner of it .
it was mere foolery ; i did not mark it .
i saw propn propn offer him a crown , yet ' twas not a crown neither , ' twas one of these coronets and , as i told you , he put it by once .
but for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it .
but , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .
and then he offered it the third time ; he put it the third time by ; and still as he refused it , the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because propn refused the crown , that it had almost choked propn , for he swounded and fell down at it .
and for mine own part , i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air .
what , did propn swound ?
he fell down in the market - place and foamed at mouth and was speechless .
no , propn hath it not , but you , and i , and honest propn , we have the falling sickness .
i know not what you mean by that , but i am sure propn fell down .
if the tag - rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them , as they use to do the players in the theatre , i am no true man .
what said he when he came unto himself ?
marry , before he fell down , when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown , he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut .
when he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said any thing amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .
but there 's no heed to be taken of them ; if propn had stabbed their mothers , they would have done no less .
and after that , he came thus sad away ?
ay .
did cicero say anything ?
ay , he spoke propn .
to what effect ?
fare you well .
there was more foolery yet , if could remember it .
will you sup with me tonight , propn ?
no , i am promised forth .
will you dine with me tomorrow ?
ay , if i be alive , and your mind hold , and your dinner worth the eating .
good , i will expect you .
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be !
he was quick mettle when he went to school .
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise , however he puts on this tardy form .
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite .
and so it is .
for this time i will leave you .
tomorrow , if you please to speak with me , i will come home to you , or , if you will , come home to me and i will wait for you .
i will do so .
i will this night , in several hands , in at his windows throw , as if they came from several citizens , propn , all tending to the great opinion that propn holds of his name , wherein obscurely propn 's ambition shall be glanced at .
and after this let propn seat him sure ; for we will shake him , or worse days endure .
good even , propn .
brought you propn home ?
why are you breathless , and why stare you so ?
are not you moved , when all the sway of earth propn like a thing unfirm ?
either there is a civil strife in propn , or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction .
why , saw you anything more wonderful ?
a common slave — you know him well by sight— held up his left hand , which did flame and burn like twenty torches join 'd , and yet his hand , not sensible of fire , remain 'd unscorch 'd .
besides — i ha ' not since put up my sword— against the propn i met a lion , who glazed upon me and went surly by without annoying me : and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear , who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets .
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon - day upon the market - place , howling and shrieking .
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet , let not men say “ these are their reasons ; they are natural , ” for , i believe , they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon .
indeed , it is a strange - disposed time ; but men may construe things after their fashion , clean from the purpose of the things themselves .
come propn to the propn tomorrow ?
he doth ; for he did bid propn send word to you he would be there tomorrow .
good then , propn .
this disturbed sky is not to walk in .
propn , propn .
who 's there ?
a propn .
propn , by your voice .
your ear is good .
propn , what night is this !
a very pleasing night to honest men .
who ever knew the heavens menace so ?
those that have known the earth so full of faults .
for my part , i have walk 'd about the streets , submitting me unto the perilous night , and thus unbraced , propn , as you see , have bared my bosom to the thunder - stone ; and when the cross blue lightning seem 'd to open the breast of propn , i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it .
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ?
it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us .
you are dull , propn , and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want , or else you use not .
you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder , to see the strange impatience of the heavens .
but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires , why all these gliding ghosts , why birds and beasts from quality and kind , why old men fool , and children calculate , why all these things change from their ordinance , their natures and preformed faculties , to monstrous quality , why , you shall find that propn hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state .
now could i , propn , name to thee a man most like this dreadful night , that thunders , lightens , opens graves , and roars as doth the lion in the propn , a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action , yet prodigious grown and fearful , as these strange eruptions are .
propn propn that you mean , is it not , propn ?
our fathers ' minds are dead , and we are govern 'd with our mothers ' spirits ; our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
indeed they say the senators tomorrow propn to establish propn as a king , and he shall wear his crown by sea and land , in every place save here in propn .
therein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong ; therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat .
nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron , can be retentive to the strength of spirit ; but life , being weary of these worldly bars , never lacks power to dismiss itself .
if i know this , know all the world besides , that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure .
so can i .
so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity .
and why should propn be a tyrant then ?
poor man !
i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the propn are but sheep .
he were no lion , were not propn hinds .
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws .
what trash is propn , what rubbish and what offal , when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as propn ?
but , o grief , where hast thou led me ?
i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman ; then i know my answer must be made .
hold , my hand .
be factious for redress of all these griefs , and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest .
there 's a bargain made .
now know you , propn , i have moved already some certain of the noblest - minded propn to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable - dangerous consequence ; and i do know , by this they stay for me in propn 's propn .
for now , this fearful night , there is no stir or walking in the streets , and the complexion of the element in favor 's like the work we have in hand , most bloody , fiery , and most terrible .
stand close awhile , for here comes one in haste .
to find out you .
who 's that ?
propn propn ?
no , it is propn , one incorporate to our attempts .
am i not stay 'd for , propn ?
i am glad o n't .
what a fearful night is this !
there 's two or three of us have seen strange sights .
am i not stay 'd for ?
tell me .
yes , you are .
o propn , if you could but win the noble propn to our party— be you content .
all this done , propn to propn 's porch , where you shall find us .
is propn propn and propn there ?
all but propn propn , and he 's gone to seek you at your house .
well , i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me .
three parts of him is ours already , and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours .
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited .
let us go , for it is after midnight , and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him .
awake , i say !
what , propn !
call 'd you , my lord ?
get me a taper in my study , propn .
when it is lighted , come and call me here .
i will , my lord .
it must be by his death , and , for my part , i know no personal cause to spurn at him , but for the general .
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking .
propn him ?
that ; and then , i grant , we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with .
the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power , and , to speak truth of propn , i have not known when his affections sway 'd more than his reason .
the taper burneth in your closet , sir .
searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seal 'd up , and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed .
get you to bed again , it is not day .
is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of propn ?
i know not , sir .
look in the calendar and bring me word .
i will , sir .
the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them .
propn , thou sleep'st : awake and see thyself !
propn propn , & amp ; c . speak , strike , redress ! ” “ propn , thou sleep'st : awake ! ” such instigations have been often dropp 'd where i have took them up .
shall propn stand under one man 's awe ?
what , propn ?
my ancestors did from the streets of propn the propn drive , when he was call 'd a king .
speak , strike , redress ! ” am i entreated to speak and strike ?
o propn , i make thee promise , if the redress will follow , thou receivest propn full petition at the hand of propn !
propn , propn is wasted fifteen days .
propn good .
propn , ' tis your brother propn at the door , who doth desire to see you .
is he alone ?
no , sir , there are moe with him .
do you know them ?
no , sir , their hats are pluck 'd about their ears , and half their faces buried in their cloaks , that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favor .
o conspiracy , propn thou to show thy dangerous brow by night , when evils are most free ?
o , then , by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage ?
seek none , conspiracy ; hide it in smiles and affability ; for if thou path , thy native semblance on , not propn itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention .
i think we are too bold upon your rest .
good morrow , propn , do we trouble you ?
know i these men that come along with you ?
yes , every man of them , and no man here but honors you , and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you .
this is propn .
he is welcome hither .
this , propn propn .
he is welcome too .
this , propn ; this , propn ; and this , propn propn .
they are all welcome .
shall i entreat a word ?
here lies the east .
doth not the day break here ?
no .
o , pardon , sir , it doth , and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day .
you shall confess that you are both deceived .
here , as i point my sword , the sun arises , which is a great way growing on the south , weighing the youthful season of the year .
some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire , and the high east propn as the propn , directly here .
give me your hands all over , one by one .
and let us swear our resolution .
no , not an oath .
if not the face of men , the sufferance of our souls , the time 's abuse— if these be motives weak , break off betimes , and every man hence to his idle bed ; so let high - sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery .
but if these , as i am sure they do , bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress ?
what other bond than secret propn that have spoke the word and will not palter ?
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it ?
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs ; unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt ; but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise , nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits , to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath ; when every drop of blood that every roman bears , and nobly bears , is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass 'd from him .
but what of propn ?
shall we sound him ?
i think he will stand very strong with us .
let us not leave him out .
no , by no means .
it shall be said his judgement ruled our hands ; our youths and wildness shall no whit appear , but all be buried in his gravity .
then leave him out .
indeed he is not fit .
shall no man else be touch 'd but only propn ?
our course will seem too bloody , propn propn , to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards ; for propn is but a limb of propn .
let us be sacrificers , but not butchers , propn .
we all stand up against the spirit of propn , and in the spirit of men there is no blood .
o , that we then could come by propn 's spirit , and not propn propn !
but , alas , propn must bleed for it !
this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious , which so appearing to the common eyes , we shall be call 'd purgers , not murderers .
and for propn propn , think not of him , for he can do no more than propn 's arm when propn 's head is off .
yet i fear him , for in the ingrafted love he bears to propn propn , good propn , do not think of him .
if he love propn , all that he can do is to himself , take thought and die for propn .
and that were much he should , for he is given to sports , to wildness , and much company .
the clock hath stricken three .
propn time to part .
but it is doubtful yet whether propn will come forth today or no , for he is superstitious grown of late , quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy , of dreams and ceremonies .
it may be these apparent prodigies , the unaccustom 'd terror of this night , and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the propn today .
never fear that .
let me work ; for i can give his humor the true bent , and i will bring him to the propn .
nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
by the eighth hour .
is that the uttermost ?
be that the uttermost , and fail not then .
propn propn doth bear propn hard , who rated him for speaking well of propn .
i wonder none of you have thought of him .
now , good propn , go along by him .
he loves me well , and i have given him reasons ; send him but hither , and i 'll fashion him .
the morning comes upon 's .
we 'll leave you , propn , and , friends , disperse yourselves , but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true propn .
fast asleep ?
enjoy the honey - heavy dew of slumber ; propn hast no figures nor no fantasies , which busy care draws in the brains of men ; therefore thou sleep'st so sound .
propn , my lord !
propn , what mean you ?
wherefore rise you now ?
it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning .
nor for yours neither .
i urged you further ; then you scratch 'd your head , and too impatiently stamp 'd with your foot .
yet i insisted , yet you answer 'd not , but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you .
so i did , fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem 'd too much enkindled , and withal hoping it was but an effect of humor , which sometime hath his hour with every man .
it will not let you eat , nor talk , nor sleep , and , could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevail 'd on your condition , i should not know you , propn .
dear my lord , make me acquainted with your cause of grief .
i am not well in health , and that is all .
propn is wise , and , were he not in health , he would embrace the means to come by it .
why , so i do .
good propn , go to bed .
what , is propn sick , and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness ?
no , my propn , you have some sick offense within your mind , which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of ; and , upon my knees , i charm you , by my once commended beauty , by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one , that you unfold to me , yourself , your half , why you are heavy , and what men tonight have had resort to you ; for here have been some six or seven , who did hide their faces even from darkness .
propn not , gentle propn .
i should not need , if you were gentle propn .
within the bond of marriage , tell me , propn , is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you ?
am i yourself but , as it were , in sort or limitation , to keep with you at meals , comfort your bed , and talk to you sometimes ?
propn i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure ?
if it be no more , propn is propn ' harlot , not his wife .
you are my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart .
if this were true , then should i know this secret .
i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman that propn propn took to wife .
i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman well reputed , propn 's daughter .
think you i am no stronger than my sex , being so father 'd and so husbanded ?
tell me your counsels , i will not disclose em .
i have made strong proof of my constancy , giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh .
can i bear that with patience and not my husband 's secrets ?
o ye gods , render me worthy of this noble wife !
propn , hark , one knocks .
propn , go in awhile , and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart .
all my engagements i will construe to thee , all the charactery of my sad brows .
leave me with haste .
propn , who 's that knocks ?
here is a sick man that would speak with you .
propn good morrow from a feeble tongue .
i am not sick , if propn have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honor .
such an exploit have i in hand , propn , had you a healthful ear to hear of it .
by all the gods that propn bow before , i here discard my sickness !
soul of propn !
brave son , derived from honorable loins !
thou , like an exorcist , hast conjured up my mortified spirit .
now bid me run , and i will strive with things impossible , propn , get the better of them .
what 's to do ?
a piece of work that will make sick men whole .
but are not some whole that we must make sick ?
that must we also .
what it is , my propn , i shall unfold to thee , as we are going to whom it must be done .
set on your foot , and with a heart new - fired i follow you , to do i know not what ; but it sufficeth that propn leads me on .
follow me then .
nor propn nor earth have been at peace tonight .
propn hath propn in her sleep cried out , “ help , ho !
my lord ?
go bid the priests do present sacrifice , and bring me their opinions of success .
i will , my lord .
what mean you , propn ?
think you to walk forth ?
you shall not stir out of your house today .
propn , i never stood on ceremonies , yet now they fright me .
there is one within , besides the things that we have heard and seen , propn most horrid sights seen by the watch .
a lioness hath whelped in the streets ; and graves have yawn 'd , and yielded up their dead ; fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds , in ranks and squadrons and right form of war , which drizzled blood upon the propn ; the noise of battle hurtled in the air , horses did neigh and dying men did groan , and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets .
what can be avoided propn end is purposed by the mighty gods ?
yet propn shall go forth , for these predictions are to the world in general as to propn .
cowards die many times before their deaths ; the valiant never taste of death but once .
they would not have you to stir forth today .
plucking the entrails of an offering forth , they could not find a heart within the beast .
the gods do this in shame of cowardice .
propn should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear .
no , propn shall not .
danger knows full well that propn is more dangerous than he .
alas , my lord , your wisdom is consumed in confidence .
do not go forth today .
let me , upon my knee , prevail in this .
propn propn shall say i am not well , and , for thy humor , i will stay at home .
here 's propn propn , he shall tell them so .
propn , all hail !
good morrow , worthy propn !
i come to fetch you to the propn - propn .
and you are come in very happy time , to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today .
tell them so , propn .
say he is sick .
propn propn send a lie ?
most mighty propn , let me know some cause , propn i be laugh 'd at when i tell them so .
but , for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i will let you know .
and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent , and on her knee propn begg 'd that i will stay at home today .
your statue spouting blood in many pipes , 90 in which so many smiling propn bathed , signifies that from you great propn shall suck reviving blood , and that great men shall press for tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance .
this by propn 's dream is signified .
and this way have you well expounded it .
i have , when you have heard what i can say .
and know it now , the propn have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty propn .
if you shall send them word you will not come , their minds may change .
besides , it were a mock propn to be render 'd , for some one to say “ break up the propn till another time , when propn 's wife shall meet with better dreams . ” if propn hide himself , shall they not whisper “ propn , propn is afraid ” ?
pardon me , propn , for my dear dear love to your proceeding bids me tell you this , and reason to my love is liable .
how foolish do your fears seem now , propn !
i am ashamed i did yield to them .
give me my robe , for i will go .
and look where propn is come to fetch me .
good morrow , propn .
propn , ' tis strucken eight .
i thank you for your pains and courtesy .
bid them prepare within .
i am to blame to be thus waited for .
now , propn ; now , propn ; what , propn , i have an hour 's talk in store for you ; remember that you call on me today ; be near me , that i may remember you .
propn , i will .
and so near will i be that your best friends shall wish i had been further .
good friends , go in and taste some wine with me , and we like friends will straightway go together .
that every like is not the same , o propn , the heart of propn yearns to think upon !
propn , beware of propn ; take heed of propn ; come not near propn ; have an eye to propn ; trust not propn ; mark it well propn propn ; propn propn loves thee not ; thou hast wronged propn propn .
there is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against propn .
if thou beest not immortal , look about you .
security gives way to conspiracy .
the mighty gods defend thee !
i prithee , boy , run to the propn - propn ; stay not to answer me , but get thee gone .
why dost thou stay ?
to know my errand , madam .
set a huge mountain ' tween my heart and tongue !
i have a man 's mind , but a woman 's might .
propn , what should i do ?
run to the propn , and nothing else ?
and so return to you , and nothing else ?
i hear none , madam .
prithee , listen well .
i heard a bustling rumor like a fray , and the wind brings it from the propn .
sooth , madam , i hear nothing .
at mine own house , good lady .
what is't o'clock ?
about the ninth hour , lady .
is propn yet gone to the propn ?
propn , not yet .
i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the propn .
thou hast some suit to propn , hast thou not ?
that i have , lady .
if it will please propn to be so good to propn as to hear me , i shall beseech him to befriend himself .
why , propn thou any harm 's intended towards him ?
none that i know will be , much that i fear may chance .
good morrow to you .
here the street is narrow , the throng that follows propn at the heels , of senators , of praetors , common suitors , will crowd a feeble man almost to death .
i 'll get me to a place more void and there speak to great propn as he comes along .
come to me again , and bring me word what he doth say to thee .
the ides of propn are come .
ay , propn , but not gone .
propn , propn !
read this schedule .
propn doth desire you to o'er read , at your best leisure , this his humble suit .
o propn , read mine first , for mine 's a suit that touches propn nearer .
read it , great propn .
what touches us ourself shall be last served .
propn not , propn ; read it instantly .
what , is the fellow mad ?
propn , give place .
what , urge you your petitions in the street ?
come to the propn .
i wish your enterprise today may thrive .
what enterprise , propn ?
fare you well .
what said propn propn ?
he wish 'd today our enterprise might thrive .
i fear our purpose is discovered .
look , how he makes to propn .
mark him .
if this be known , propn or propn never shall turn back , for i will slay myself .
cassius , be constant .
propn propn speaks not of our purposes ; for , look , he smiles , and propn doth not change .
propn knows his time , for , look you , propn , he draws propn propn out of the way .
where is propn propn ?
let him go , and presently prefer his suit to propn .
he is address 'd ; press near and second him .
propn , you are the first that rears your hand .
are we all ready ?
what is now amiss that propn and his propn must redress ?
most high , most mighty , and most puissant propn , propn propn throws before thy seat an humble heart .
i must prevent thee , propn .
these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children .
be not fond to think that propn bears such rebel blood that will be thaw 'd from the true quality with that which melteth fools , i mean sweet words , low - crooked court'sies , and base spaniel - fawning .
thy brother by decree is banished .
if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him , i spurn thee like a cur out of my way .
propn , propn doth not wrong , nor without cause will he be satisfied .
is there no voice more worthy than my own , to sound more sweetly in great propn 's ear for the repealing of my banish 'd brother ?
what , propn ?
as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for propn propn .
speak , hands , for me !
then fall , propn !
propn !
freedom !
go to the pulpit , propn .
and propn too .
where 's propn ?
here , quite confounded with this mutiny .
stand fast together , lest some friend of propn 's should chance— talk not of standing .
propn , good cheer , there is no harm intended to your person , nor to no propn else .
so tell them , propn .
and leave us , propn , lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief .
do so , and let no man abide this deed but we the doers .
where is propn ?
fled to his house amazed .
men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run as it were doomsday .
fates , we will know your pleasures .
that we shall die , we know ; ' tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon .
why , he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death .
grant that , and then is death a benefit ; so are we propn 's friends that have abridged his time of fearing death .
how many times shall propn bleed in sport , that now on propn 's basis lies along no worthier than the dust !
so oft as that shall be , so often shall the knot of us be call 'd the men that gave their country liberty .
what , shall we forth ?
ay , every man away .
propn shall lead , and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of propn .
soft , who comes here ?
a friend of propn 's .
if propn will vouchsafe that propn may safely come to him and be resolved how propn hath deserved to lie in death , propn propn shall not love propn dead so well as propn living , but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble propn propn the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith .
so says my master propn .
propn master is a wise and valiant roman ; i never thought him worse .
tell him , so please him come unto this place , he shall be satisfied and , by my honor , propn untouch 'd .
i 'll fetch him presently .
i know that we shall have him well to friend .
i wish we may , but yet have i a mind that fears him much , and my misgiving still propn shrewdly to the purpose .
o mighty propn !
dost thou lie so low ?
are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , propn to this little measure ?
if i myself , there is no hour so fit as propn 's death 's hour , nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords , made rich with the most noble blood of all this world .
i do beseech ye , if you bear me hard , now , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke , propn your pleasure .
o antony , beg not your death of us !
though now we must appear bloody and cruel , as , by our hands and this our present act , you see we do , yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done .
our hearts you see not ; they are pitiful ; and pity to the general wrong of propn as fire drives out fire , so pity pity— propn done this deed on propn .
for your part , to you our swords have leaden points , propn propn ; our arms in strength of malice , and our hearts of brothers ' temper , do receive you in with all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
your voice shall be as strong as any man 's in the disposing of new dignities .
only be patient till we have appeased the multitude , beside themselves with fear , and then we will deliver you the cause why i , that did love propn when i struck him , have thus proceeded .
i doubt not of your wisdom .
let each man render me his bloody hand .
first , propn propn , will i shake with you ; next , propn propn , do i take your hand ; now , propn propn , yours ; now yours , propn ; propn , propn ; and , my valiant propn , yours ; though last , not least in love , yours , good propn .
gentlemen all , — alas , what shall i say ?
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds , weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood , it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies .
pardon me , propn !
propn propn propn me , propn propn .
the enemies of propn shall say this : then , in a friend , it is cold modesty .
i blame you not for praising propn so ; but what compact mean you to have with us ?
will you be prick 'd in number of our friends , or shall we on , and not depend on you ?
therefore i took your hands , but was indeed sway 'd from the point by looking down on propn .
friends am i with you all and love you all , upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein propn was dangerous .
or else were this a savage spectacle .
our reasons are so full of good regard that were you , propn , the son of propn , you should be satisfied .
you shall , propn propn .
propn , a word with you .
by your pardon , i will myself into the pulpit first , and show the reason of our propn 's death .
what propn shall speak , i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission , and that we are contented propn shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies .
it shall advantage more than do us wrong .
i know not what may fall ; i like it not .
propn propn , here , take you propn 's body .
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us , but speak all good you can devise of propn , and say you do't by our permission , else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral .
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going , after my speech is ended .
be it so , i do desire no more .
prepare the body then , and follow us .
o , pardon me , thou bleeding piece of earth , that i am meek and gentle with these butchers !
thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times .
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
i do , propn propn .
propn did write for him to come to propn .
passion , i see , is catching , for mine eyes , seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , began to water .
is thy master coming ?
he lies tonight within seven leagues of propn .
post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced .
here is a mourning propn , a dangerous propn , no propn of safety for propn yet ; propn hence , and tell him so .
yet stay awhile , propn shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the market - place .
there shall i try , in my oration , how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men , according to the which thou shalt discourse to young propn of the state of things .
lend me your hand .
i will hear propn speak .
i will hear propn and compare their reasons , when severally we hear them rendered .
the noble propn is ascended .
silence !
be patient till the last .
romans , countrymen , and lovers !
hear me for my cause , and be silent , that you may hear .
believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor , that you may believe .
censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses , that you may the better judge .
if there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of propn 's , to him i say that propn ' love to propn was no less than his .
if then that friend demand why propn rose against propn , this is my answer : not that i loved propn less , but that i loved propn more .
had you rather propn were living and die all slaves , than that propn were dead to live all freemen ?
as propn loved me , i weep for him ; as he was fortunate , i rejoice at it ; as he was valiant , i honor him ; but as he was ambitious , i slew him .
there is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his valor , and death for his ambition .
who is here so base that would be a bondman ?
if any , speak , for him have i offended .
who is here so rude that would not be a propn ?
if any , speak , for him have i offended .
who is here so vile that will not love his country ?
if any , speak , for him have i offended .
i pause for a reply .
none , propn , none .
then none have i offended .
i have done no more to propn than you shall do to propn .
the question of his death is enrolled in the propn , his glory not extenuated , wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced , for which he suffered death .
here comes his body , mourned by propn propn , who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying , a place in the commonwealth , as which of you shall not ?
with this i depart — that , as i slew my best lover for the good of propn , i have the same dagger for myself , when it shall please my country to need my death .
bring him with triumph home unto his house .
give him a statue with his ancestors .
let him be propn .
propn 's better parts shall be crown 'd in propn .
we 'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
my countrymen— peace !
silence !
propn speaks .
peace , ho !
good countrymen , let me depart alone , and , for my sake , stay here with propn .
do grace to propn 's corse , and grace his speech tending to propn 's glories , which propn propn , by our permission , is allow 'd to make .
i do entreat you , not a man depart , save i alone , till propn have spoke .
for propn ' sake , i am beholding to you .
what does he say of propn ?
he says , for propn ' sake , he finds himself beholding to us all .
twere best he speak no harm of propn here .
this propn was a tyrant .
nay , that 's certain .
we are blest that propn is rid of him .
peace !
let us hear what propn can say .
you gentle propn propn , ho !
let us hear him .
here , under leave of propn and the rest— for propn is an honorable man ; so are they all , all honorable men— come i to speak in propn 's funeral .
he hath brought many captives home to propn , whose ransoms did the general coffers fill .
did this in propn seem ambitious ?
yet propn says he was ambitious , and propn is an honorable man .
you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown , which he did thrice refuse .
was this ambition ?
yet propn says he was ambitious , and sure he is an honorable man .
i speak not to disprove what propn spoke , but here i am to speak what i do know .
you all did love him once , not without cause ; what cause withholds you then to mourn for him ?
methinks there is much reason in his sayings .
if thou consider rightly of the matter , propn has had great wrong .
has he , masters ?
i fear there will a worse come in his place .
propn ye his words ?
he would not take the crown ; therefore ' tis certain he was not ambitious .
if it be found so , some will dear abide it .
there 's not a nobler man in propn than propn .
now mark him , he begins again to speak .
but yesterday the word of propn might have stood against the world .
now lies he there , and none so poor to do him reverence .
i will not do them wrong ; i rather choose to wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , than i will wrong such honorable men .
but here 's a parchment with the seal of propn ; i found it in his closet , ' tis his will .
let but the commons hear this testament— which , pardon me , i do not mean to read— and they would go and kiss dead propn 's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood , propn , beg a hair of him for memory , and , dying , mention it within their wills , bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue .
we 'll hear the will .
read it , propn propn .
the will , the will !
we will hear propn 's will .
have patience , gentle friends , i must not read it ; it is not meet you know how propn loved you .
you are not wood , you are not stones , but men ; and , being men , hearing the will of propn , it will inflame you , it will make you mad .
propn good you know not that you are his heirs , for if you should , o , what would come of it !
read the will ; we 'll hear it , propn .
you shall read us the will , propn 's will .
will you be patient ?
will you stay a while ?
i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it .
i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabb 'd propn ; i do fear it .
they were traitors .
the testament !
they were villains , murderers .
the will !
read the will !
you will compel me then to read the will ?
then make a ring about the corse of propn , and let me show you him that made the will .
shall i descend ?
and will you give me leave ?
you shall have leave .
stand from the hearse , stand from the body .
room for propn , most noble propn .
nay , press not so upon me , stand far off .
if you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
you all do know this mantle .
i remember the first time ever propn put it on ; ' twas on a summer 's evening , in his tent , that day he overcame the propn .
propn , o you gods , how dearly propn loved him !
this was the most unkindest cut of all ; for when the noble propn saw him stab , propn , more strong than traitors ' arms , quite vanquish 'd him .
then burst his mighty heart , and , in his mantle muffling up his face , even at the base of propn 's statue , which all the while ran blood , great propn fell .
o , now you weep , and i perceive you feel the dint of pity .
these are gracious drops .
kind souls , what weep you when you but behold our propn 's vesture wounded ?
look you here , here is himself , marr 'd , as you see , with traitors .
o piteous spectacle !
o noble propn !
o woeful day !
o traitors , villains !
o most bloody sight !
let not a traitor live !
stay , countrymen .
peace there !
hear the noble propn .
we 'll hear him , we 'll follow him , we 'll die with him .
good friends , sweet friends , let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny .
they that have done this deed are honorable .
i come not , friends , to steal away your hearts .
but were i propn , and propn propn , there were an propn would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of propn that should move the stones of propn to rise and mutiny .
we 'll mutiny .
we 'll burn the house of propn .
away , then !
come , seek the conspirators .
yet hear me , countrymen ; yet hear me speak .
peace , ho !
hear propn , most noble propn !
why , friends , you go to do you know not what .
wherein hath propn thus deserved your loves ?
alas , you know not ; i must tell you then .
you have forgot the will i told you of .
here is the will , and under propn 's seal .
to every roman citizen he gives , to every several man , seventy - five drachmas .
o royal propn !
hear me with patience .
peace , ho !
here was a propn !
when comes such another ?
we 'll burn his body in the holy place and with the brands fire the traitors ' houses .
take up the body .
go fetch fire .
propn down benches .
propn down forms , windows , any thing .
now let it work .
propn , propn is already come to propn .
where is he ?
he and propn are at propn 's house .
and thither will i straight to visit him .
he comes upon a wish .
propn is merry , and in this mood will give us any thing .
i heard him say , propn and propn are rid like madmen through the gates of propn .
propn they had some notice of the people , how i had moved them .
bring me to propn .
i dreamt tonight that i did feast with propn , and things unluckily charge my fantasy .
i have no will to wander forth of doors , yet something leads me forth .
what is your name ?
propn are you going ?
where do you dwell ?
are you a married man or a bachelor ?
answer every man directly .
ay , and briefly .
ay , and wisely .
ay , and truly , you were best .
what is my name ?
propn am i going ?
where do i dwell ?
am i a married man or a bachelor ?
proceed directly .
directly , i am going to propn 's funeral .
as a friend or an enemy ?
as a friend .
that matter is answered directly .
for your dwelling , briefly .
propn , i dwell by the propn .
your name , sir , truly .
truly , my name is propn .
i am propn the poet , i am propn the poet .
tear him for his bad verses , tear him for his bad verses .
i am not propn the conspirator .
tear him , tear him !
come , brands , ho , fire- .
some to decius ' house , and some to propn 's , some to propn ' .
away , go !
these many then shall die , their names are prick 'd .
i do consent— prick him down , propn .
upon condition propn shall not live , who is your sister 's son , propn propn .
he shall not live ; look , with a spot i damn him .
but , propn , go you to propn 's house , fetch the will hither , and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies .
what , shall i find you here ?
or here , or at the propn .
this is a slight unmeritable man , propn to be sent on errands .
is it fit , the three - fold world divided , he should stand one of the three to share it ?
so you thought him , and took his voice who should be prick 'd to die in our black sentence and proscription .
propn , i have seen more days than you , and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , to groan and sweat under the business , either led or driven , as we point the way ; and having brought our treasure where we will , then take we down his load and turn him off , like to the empty ass , to shake his ears and graze in commons .
you may do your will , but he 's a tried and valiant soldier .
so is my horse , propn , and for that i do appoint him store of provender .
it is a creature that i teach to fight , to wind , to stop , to run directly on , his corporal motion govern 'd by my spirit .
do not talk of him but as a property .
and now , propn , listen great things .
let us do so , for we are at the stake , and bay 'd about with many enemies ; and some that smile have in their hearts , i fear , millions of mischiefs .
stand , ho !
he is at hand , and propn is come to do you salutation from his master .
let me be resolved .
with courtesy and with respect enough , but not with such familiar instances , nor with such free and friendly conference , as he hath used of old .
thou hast described a hot friend cooling .
ever note , propn , when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforced ceremony .
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith ; but hollow men , like horses hot at hand , make gallant show and promise of their mettle ; but when they should endure the bloody spur , they fall their crests and like deceitful jades propn in the trial .
comes his army on ?
propn gently on to meet him .
stand , ho !
stand , ho !
speak the word along .
stand !
stand !
stand !
most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
judge me , you gods !
propn i mine enemies ?
and , if not so , how should i wrong a brother ?
propn , this sober form of yours hides wrongs , and when you do them— propn , be content , speak your griefs softly , i do know you well .
propn , propn our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground .
that you have wrong 'd me doth appear in this : you have condemn 'd and noted propn propn for taking bribes here of the propn , wherein my letters , praying on his side , because i knew the man , were slighted off .
you wrong 'd yourself to write in such a case .
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment .
let me tell you , propn , you yourself are much condemn 'd to have an itching palm , to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers .
i an itching palm ?
you know that you are propn that speaks this , or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .
the name of propn honors this corruption , and chastisement doth therefore hide his head .
propn ?
remember propn , the ides of propn remember .
did not great propn bleed for justice ' sake ?
what , shall one of us , that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers , shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be grasped thus ?
i had rather be a dog , and bay the moon , than such a propn .
propn , bait not me , i 'll not endure it .
go to , you are not , propn .
i am .
i say you are not .
away , slight man !
is't possible ?
hear me , for i will speak .
must i give way and room to your rash choler ?
shall i be frighted when a madman stares ?
o gods , ye gods !
must i endure all this ?
all this ?
ay , more .
must i bouge ?
must i observe you ?
must i stand and crouch under your testy humor ?
by the gods , you shall digest the venom of your spleen , though it do split you , for , from this day forth , i 'll use you for my mirth , yea , for my laughter , when you are waspish .
is it come to this ?
for mine own part , i shall be glad to learn of noble men .
you wrong me every way , you wrong me , propn .
i said , an elder soldier , not a better .
did i say “ better ” ?
if you did , i care not .
when propn lived , he durst not thus have moved me .
peace , peace !
you durst not so have tempted him .
i durst not ?
no .
what , durst not tempt him ?
for your life you durst not .
do not presume too much upon my love ; i may do that i shall be sorry for .
you have done that you should be sorry for .
there is no terror , propn , in your threats , for i am arm 'd so strong in honesty , that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not .
i did send to you for certain sums of gold , which you denied me , for i can raise no money by vile means .
was that done like propn ?
should i have propn propn propn so ?
when propn propn grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends , be ready , gods , with all your thunderbolts , dash him to pieces !
i denied you not .
you did .
i did not .
he was but a fool that brought my answer back .
propn hath rived my heart .
a friend should bear his friend 's infirmities , but propn makes mine greater than they are .
i do not , till you practise them on me .
you love me not .
i do not like your faults .
a friendly eye could never see such faults .
a flatterer 's would not , though they do appear as huge as high propn .
come , propn , and young propn , come , revenge yourselves alone on propn , for propn is aweary of the world : hated by one he loves ; braved by his brother ; check 'd like a bondman ; all his faults observed , set in a notebook , learn 'd and conn 'd by rote , to cast into my teeth .
strike , as thou didst at propn , for i know , when thou didst hate him worst , thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst propn .
sheathe your dagger .
be angry when you will , it shall have scope ; do what you will , dishonor shall be humor .
o propn , you are yoked with a lamb , that carries anger as the flint bears fire , who , much enforced , shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again .
propn propn lived to be but mirth and laughter to his propn , when grief and blood ill - temper 'd vexeth him ?
when i spoke that , i was ill - temper 'd too .
do you confess so much ?
give me your hand .
and my heart too .
have not you love enough to bear with me , when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful ?
yes , propn , and from henceforth , when you are overearnest with your propn , he 'll think your mother chides , and leave you so .
let me go in to see the generals .
there is some grudge between 'em , ' tis not meet they be alone .
you shall not come to them .
nothing but death shall stay me .
for shame , you generals !
what do you mean ?
love , and be friends , as two such men should be ; for i have seen more years , i 'm sure , than ye .
ha , ha !
how vilely doth this cynic rhyme !
get you hence , sirrah ; saucy fellow , hence !
bear with him , propn ; ' tis his fashion .
i 'll know his humor when he knows his time .
away , away , be gone !
propn and propn , bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight .
and come yourselves and bring propn with you immediately to us .
propn , a bowl of wine !
i did not think you could have been so angry .
o propn , i am sick of many griefs .
of your philosophy you make no use , if you give place to accidental evils .
no man bears sorrow better .
propn is dead .
ha ?
portia ?
she is dead .
impatient of my absence , and grief that young propn with propn propn have made themselves so strong : for with her death that tidings came : with this she fell distract , and , her attendants absent , swallow 'd fire .
and died so ?
even so .
o ye immortal gods !
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
propn , propn , till the wine o'erswell the cup ; i can not drink too much of propn ' love .
propn , art thou gone ?
myself have letters of the selfsame tenure .
with what addition ?
that by proscription and bills of outlawry propn , propn , and propn have put to death an hundred senators .
cicero one !
no , propn .
nor nothing in your letters writ of her ?
nothing , propn .
that , methinks , is strange .
why ask you ?
hear you ought of her in yours ?
no , my lord .
now , as you are a roman , tell me true .
why , farewell , propn .
we must die , propn .
with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now .
even so great men great losses should endure .
i have as much of this in art as you , but yet my nature could not bear it so .
well , to our work alive .
what do you think of marching to propn presently ?
i do not think it good .
your reason ?
good reasons must of force give place to better .
the people ' twixt propn and this ground do stand but in a forced affection , for they have grudged us contribution .
the enemy , marching along by them , by them shall make a fuller number up , come on refresh 'd , new - added , and encouraged ; from which advantage shall we cut him off if at propn we do face him there , these people at our back .
hear me , good brother .
under your pardon .
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune ; omitted , all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries .
on such a full sea are we now afloat , and we must take the current when it serves , or lose our ventures .
the deep of night is crept upon our talk , and nature must obey necessity , which we will niggard with a little rest .
there is no more to say ?
no more .
good night .
early tomorrow will we rise and hence .
o my dear brother !
this was an ill beginning of the night .
never come such division ' tween our souls !
let it not , propn .
good night , good brother .
good night , propn propn .
where is thy instrument ?
here in the tent .
what , thou speak'st drowsily ?
poor knave , i blame thee not , thou art o'erwatch 'd .
call propn and some other of my men , i 'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
propn and propn !
calls my lord ?
i pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep ; it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother propn .
so please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
i was sure your lordship did not give it me .
bear with me , good boy , i am much forgetful .
propn thou hold up thy heavy eyes a while , and touch thy instrument a strain or two ?
ay , my lord , a n't please you .
it does , my boy .
i trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .
it is my duty , sir .
i should not urge thy duty past thy might ; i know young bloods look for a time of rest .
i have slept , my lord , already .
it was well done , and thou shalt sleep again ; i will not hold thee long .
if thou dost nod , thou break'st thy instrument ; i 'll take it from thee ; and , good boy , good night .
let me see , let me see ; is not the leaf turn 'd down where i left reading ?
here it is , i think .
how ill this taper burns !
i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition .
art thou some god , some angel , or some devil that makest my blood cold , and my hair to stare ?
speak to me what thou art .
thy evil spirit , propn .
why comest thou ?
to tell thee thou shalt see me at propn .
well , then i shall see thee again ?
ay , at propn .
why , i will see thee at propn then .
now i have taken heart thou vanishest .
propn !
claudius !
the strings , my lord , are false .
my lord ?
propn thou dream , propn , that thou so criedst out ?
my lord , i do not know that i did cry .
yes , that thou didst .
propn thou see any thing ?
nothing , my lord .
my lord ?
my lord ?
why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?
did we , my lord ?
no , my lord , i saw nothing .
nor i , my lord .
it shall be done , my lord .
now , propn , our hopes are answered .
you said the enemy would not come down , but keep the hills and upper regions .
it proves not so .
their battles are at hand ; they mean to warn us at propn here , answering before we do demand of them .
propn , i am in their bosoms , and i know propn they do it .
they could be content to visit other places , and come down with fearful bravery , thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage ; but ' tis not so .
prepare you , generals .
the enemy comes on in gallant show ; their bloody sign of battle is hung out , and something to be done immediately .
propn , lead your battle softly on , upon the left hand of the even field .
upon the right hand i , keep thou the left .
why do you cross me in this exigent ?
i do not cross you , but i will do so .
they stand , and would have parley .
propn propn , shall we give sign of battle ?
no , propn , we will answer on their charge .
make forth , the generals would have some words .
stir not until the signal .
words before blows .
is it so , countrymen ?
not that we love words better , as you do .
good words are better than bad strokes , propn .
in your bad strokes , propn , you give good words .
witness the hole you made in propn 's heart , crying “ long live !
not stingless too .
o , yes , and soundless too , for you have stol'n their buzzing , propn , and very wisely threat before you sting .
you show 'd your teeth like apes , and fawn 'd like hounds , and bow 'd like bondmen , kissing propn 's feet ; propn damned propn , like a cur , behind propn propn on the neck .
come , come , the cause .
if arguing make us sweat , the proof of it will turn to redder drops .
never , till propn 's three and thirty wounds be well avenged , or till another propn have added slaughter to the sword of traitors .
propn , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands , unless thou bring'st them with thee .
so i hope , i was not born to die on propn ' sword .
o , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , young man , thou couldst not die more honorable .
a peevish school boy , worthless of such honor , propn with a masker and a reveller !
propn propn still !
if you dare fight today , come to the field ; if not , when you have stomachs .
why , now , blow and , swell billow , and swim bark !
the storm is up , and all is on the hazard .
propn , propn !
propn , a word with you .
my lord ?
propn , this is my birthday , as this very day was propn born .
give me thy hand , propn .
be thou my witness that , against my will , as propn was , am i compell 'd to set upon one battle all our liberties .
you know that i held propn strong , and his opinion .
now i change my mind , and partly credit things that do presage .
coming from propn , on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell , and there they perch 'd , gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands , who to propn here consorted us .
this morning are they fled away and gone , and in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites propn o'er our heads and downward look on us , as we were sickly prey .
their shadows seem a canopy most fatal , under which our army lies , ready to give up the ghost .
believe not so .
i but believe it partly , for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly .
even so , propn .
now , most noble propn , the gods today stand friendly , that we may , propn in peace , lead on our days to age !
but , since the affairs of men rest still incertain , let 's reason with the worst that may befall .
if we do lose this battle , then is this the very last time we shall speak together .
what are you then determined to do ?
even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame propn for the death which he did give himself : i know not how , but i do find it cowardly and vile , for fear of what might fall , so to prevent the time of life : arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below .
then , if we lose this battle , you are contented to be led in triumph propn the streets of propn ?
no , propn , no .
therefore our everlasting farewell take .
for ever , and for ever , farewell , propn !
if we do meet again , why , we shall smile ; if not , why then this parting was well made .
for ever and for ever farewell , propn !
if we do meet again , we 'll smile indeed ; if not , ' tis true this parting was well made .
why then , lead on .
o , that a man might know the end of this day 's business ere it come !
away !
ride , ride , propn , ride , and give these bills unto the legions on the other side .
let them set on at once , for i perceive but cold demeanor in propn ' wing , and sudden push gives them the overthrow .
ride , ride , propn .
let them all come down .
o , look , propn , look , the villains fly !
myself have to mine own turn 'd enemy .
this ensign here of mine was turning back ; i slew the coward , and did take it from him .
o propn , propn gave the word too early , who , having some advantage on propn , took it too eagerly .
his soldiers fell to spoil , whilst we by propn are all enclosed .
fly further off , my lord , fly further off ; propn propn is in your tents , my lord ; fly , therefore , noble propn , fly far off .
this hill is far enough .
look , look , propn : are those my tents where i perceive the fire ?
they are , my lord .
propn , if thou lovest me , propn thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him , till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again , that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
i will be here again , even with a thought .
o my lord !
what news ?
o , he lights too .
come hither , sirrah .
in propn did i take thee prisoner , and then i swore thee , saving of thy life , that whatsoever i did bid thee do , thou shouldst attempt it .
come now , keep thine oath ; now be a freeman , and with this good sword , that ran through propn 's bowels , search this bosom .
far from this country propn shall run , where never propn shall take note of him .
it is but change , propn , for propn is overthrown by noble propn ' power , as propn ' legions are by propn .
these tidings would well comfort propn .
where did you leave him ?
all disconsolate , with propn his bondman , on this hill .
is not that he that lies upon the ground ?
he lies not like the living .
o my heart !
is not that he ?
our day is gone ; propn , dews , and dangers come ; our deeds are done !
propn of my success hath done this deed .
propn of good success hath done this deed .
o error , soon conceived , thou never comest unto a happy birth , but kill'st the mother that engender 'd thee !
what , propn !
where art thou , propn ?
seek him , propn , whilst i go to meet the noble propn , thrusting this report into his ears .
i may say “ thrusting ” it , for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of propn as tidings of this sight .
did i not meet thy friends ?
and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory , and bid me give it thee ?
propn thou not hear their shouts ?
alas , thou hast misconstrued every thing !
but , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow ; propn propn bid me give it thee , and i will do his bidding .
come , propn ' sword , and find propn ' heart .
where , where , propn , doth his body lie ?
propn , yonder , and propn mourning it .
propn ' face is upward .
he is slain .
o propn propn , thou art mighty yet !
thy spirit walks abroad , and turns our swords in our own proper entrails .
propn propn !
look whether he have not crown 'd dead cassius !
yet , countrymen , o , yet hold up your heads !
what bastard doth not ?
who will go with me ?
and i am propn , propn propn , i ; propn , my country 's friend ; know me for propn !
o young and noble propn , art thou down ?
why , now thou diest as bravely as propn , and mayst be honor 'd , being propn 's son .
yield , or thou diest .
only i yield to die .
there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight : propn propn , and be honor 'd in his death .
we must not .
a noble prisoner !
propn , ho !
tell propn , propn is ta'en .
i 'll tell the news .
where is he ?
propn , propn , propn is safe enough .
when you do find him , or alive or dead , he will be found like propn , like himself .
this is not propn , friend , but , i assure you , a prize no less in worth .
keep this man safe , give him all kindness ; i had rather have such men my friends than enemies .
go on , and see whether propn be alive or dead , and bring us word unto propn ' tent how every thing is chanced .
come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .
propn show 'd the torch - light , but , my lord , he came not back .
he is or ta'en or slain .
sit thee down , propn .
slaying is the word : it is a deed in fashion .
propn thee , propn .
what , i , my lord ?
no , not for all the world .
peace then , no words .
i 'll rather kill myself .
propn thee , dardanius .
shall i do such a deed ?
o dardanius !
o propn !
what ill request did propn make to thee ?
to kill him , propn .
look , he meditates .
now is that noble vessel full of grief , that it runs over even at his eyes .
come hither , good propn , list a word .
what says my lord ?
i know my hour is come .
not so , my lord .
nay , i am sure it is , propn .
propn propn , thou know'st that we two went to school together ; even for that our love of old , i prithee , hold thou my sword - hilts , whilst i run on it .
that 's not an office for a friend , my lord .
i shall have glory by this losing day , more than propn and propn propn by this vile conquest shall attain unto .
so , fare you well at once , for propn ' tongue propn almost ended his life 's history .
night hangs upon mine eyes , my bones would rest that have but labor 'd to attain this hour .
fly , my lord , fly .
hence !
thou art a fellow of a good respect ; propn life hath had some smatch of honor in it .
hold then my sword , and turn away thy face , while i do run upon it .
wilt thou , propn ?
give me your hand first .
fare you well , my lord .
propn , good propn .
what man is that ?
ay , if propn will prefer me to you .
do so , good propn .
how died my master , propn ?
i held the sword , and he did run on it .
propn , then take him to follow thee that did the latest service to my master .
this was the noblest propn of them all .
all the conspirators , save only he , did that they did in envy of great propn ; he only , in a general honest thought and common good to all , made one of them .
when shall we three meet again ?
in thunder , lightning , or in rain ?
when the propn 's done ; when the battle 's lost and won .
that will be ere the set of sun .
where the place ?
upon the heath .
there to meet with propn .
paddock calls .
propn !
fair is foul , and foul is fair .
propn through the fog and filthy air .
what bloody man is that ?
he can report , as seemeth by his plight , of the revolt the newest state .
this is the sergeant , who , like a good and hardy soldier fought ’ gainst my captivity .
propn , brave friend !
say to the propn the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it .
doubtful it stood , as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art .
o valiant cousin !
worthy gentleman !
as whence the sun ’ gins his reflection propn storms and direful thunders break , so from that spring whence comfort seem 'd to come propn swells .
dismay 'd not this our captains , propn and propn ?
yes , as sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion .
except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds , or memorize another propn , i can not tell— but i am faint ; my gashes cry for help .
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds ; they smack of honor both .
who comes here ?
the worthy propn of propn .
what a haste looks through his eyes !
so should he look that seems to speak things strange .
propn save the king !
whence camest thou , worthy propn ?
from propn , great propn , where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold .
great happiness !
that now propn , the norways ’ king , craves composition ; nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed , at propn propn 's propn , ten thousand dollars to our general use .
no more that propn of propn shall deceive our bosom interest .
go pronounce his present death , and with his former title greet propn .
i 'll see it done .
what he hath lost , noble propn hath won .
where hast thou been , sister ?
killing swine .
sister , where thou ?
a sailor 's wife had chestnuts in her lap , and mounch 'd , and mounch 'd , and mounch 'd .
give me , ” quoth i .
aroint thee , witch ! ” the rump - fed ronyon cries .
i 'll give thee a wind .
thou'rt kind .
and i another .
propn se'nnights nine times nine propn he dwindle , peak , and pine ; though his bark can not be lost , yet it shall be tempest - tost .
look what i have .
show me , show me .
a drum , a drum !
propn doth come .
peace !
the charm 's wound up .
so foul and fair a day i have not seen .
how far is't call 'd to propn ?
what are these so wither 'd , and so wild in their attire , that look not like the inhabitants o ’ the earth , and yet are o n't ?
live you ?
or are you aught that man may question ?
you seem to understand me , by each at once her choppy finger laying upon her skinny lips .
you should be women , and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so .
all hail , propn !
hail to thee , propn of propn !
all hail , propn !
hail to thee , propn of propn !
good sir , why do you start , and seem to fear things that do sound so fair ?
i ’ the name of truth , are ye fantastical or that indeed which outwardly ye show ?
my noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope , that he seems rapt withal .
to me you speak not .
if you can look into the seeds of time , and say which grain will grow and which will not , speak then to me , who neither beg nor fear your favors nor your hate .
propn !
propn !
propn !
lesser than propn , and greater .
not so happy , yet much happier .
thou shalt get kings , though thou be none .
so all hail , propn and propn !
propn and propn , all hail !
stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more .
by propn 's death i know i am propn of propn ; but how of propn ?
the propn of propn lives , a prosperous gentleman ; and to be propn propn not within the prospect of belief , no more than to be propn .
say from whence you owe this strange intelligence , or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting ?
speak , i charge you .
the earth hath bubbles as the water has , and these are of them .
propn are they vanish 'd ?
into the air , and what seem 'd corporal melted as breath into the wind .
would they had stay 'd !
were such things here as we do speak about ?
or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner ?
your children shall be kings .
you shall be propn .
to the selfsame tune and words .
who 's here ?
silenced with that , in viewing o'er the rest o ’ the selfsame day , he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks , nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , strange images of death .
as thick as hail came post with post , and every one did bear propn praises in his kingdom 's great defense , and pour 'd them down before him .
we are sent to give thee , from our royal master , thanks ; only to herald thee into his sight , not pay thee .
and for an earnest of a greater honor , he bade me , from him , call thee propn of propn .
in which addition , hail , most worthy propn , for it is thine .
what , can the devil speak true ?
the propn of propn lives .
why do you dress me in borrow 'd robes ?
who was the propn lives yet , but under heavy judgement bears that life which he deserves to lose .
whether he was combined with those of propn , or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage , or that with both he labor 'd in his country 's wreck , i know not ; but treasons capital , confess 'd and proved , have overthrown him .
aside .
the greatest is behind .
thanks for your pains .
do you not hope your children shall be kings , when those that gave the propn of propn to me promised no less to them ?
that , trusted propn yet enkindle you unto the crown , besides the propn of propn .
aside .
aside .
this supernatural can not be ill , can not be good .
if ill , why hath it given me earnest of success , commencing in a truth ?
i am propn of propn .
if good , why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs , against the use of nature ?
look , how our partner 's rapt .
aside .
if chance will have me king , why , chance may crown me without my stir .
aside .
come what come may , [ aside .
come what come may , propn and the hour runs through the roughest day .
propn propn , we stay upon your leisure .
kind gentlemen , your pains are register 'd where every day i turn the leaf to read them .
let us toward the king .
think upon what hath chanced , and at more time , the interim having weigh 'd it , let us speak our free hearts each to other .
very gladly .
till then , enough .
come , friends .
is execution done on propn ?
are not those in commission yet return 'd ?
my liege , they are not yet come back .
but i have spoke with one that saw him die , who did report that very frankly he confess 'd his treasons , propn your highness ’ pardon , and set forth a deep repentance .
nothing in his life became him like the leaving it ; he died as one that had been studied in his death , to throw away the dearest thing he owed as ’ twere a careless trifle .
o worthiest cousin !
the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me .
thou art so far before , that swiftest wing of recompense is slow to overtake thee .
would thou hadst less deserved , that the proportion both of thanks and payment might have been mine !
only i have left to say , more is thy due than more than all can pay .
the service and the loyalty i owe , in doing it , pays itself .
welcome hither .
i have begun to plant thee , and will labor to make thee full of growing .
propn propn , that hast no less deserved , nor must be known no less to have done so ; let me enfold thee and hold thee to my heart .
there if i grow , the harvest is your own .
my plenteous joys , propn in fullness , seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow .
from hence to propn , and bind us further to you .
my worthy propn !
aside .
that is a step on which i must fall down , or else o'erleap , for in my way it lies .
true , worthy propn !
he is full so valiant , and in his commendations i am fed ; it is a banquet to me .
let 's after him , whose care is gone before to bid us welcome : it is a peerless kinsman .
they met me in the day of success , and i have learned by the perfectest report , they have more in them than mortal knowledge .
when i burned in desire to question them further , they made themselves air , into which they vanished .
yet do i fear thy nature ; it is too full o ’ the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way .
thou wouldst be great ; art not without ambition , but without the illness should attend it .
the propn comes here tonight .
thou'rt mad to say it !
is not thy master with him ?
one of my fellows had the speed of him , who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more than would make up his message .
give him tending ; he brings great news .
the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of propn under my battlements .
come , you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts , unsex me here and fill me , from the crown to the toe , top - full of direst cruelty !
make thick my blood , stop up the access and passage to remorse , that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between the effect and it !
come to my woman 's breasts , and take my milk for gall , you murdering ministers , wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature 's mischief !
propn propn !
greater than both , by the all - hail hereafter !
thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present , and i feel now the future in the instant .
my dearest love , propn comes here tonight .
and when goes hence ?
tomorrow , as he purposes .
o , never shall sun that morrow see !
your face , my propn , is as a book where men may read strange matters .
we will speak further .
this castle hath a pleasant seat ; the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses .
this guest of summer , the temple - haunting martlet , does approve by his loved mansionry that the propn 's breath smells wooingly here .
no jutty , frieze , propn , nor coign of vantage , but this bird propn made his pendant bed and procreant cradle ; where they most breed and haunt , i have observed the air is delicate .
see , see , our honor 'd hostess !
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble , which still we thank as love .
propn i teach you how you shall bid propn ’ ild us for your pains , and thank us for your trouble .
all our service in every point twice done , and then done double , were poor and single business to contend against those honors deep and broad wherewith your propn loads our house .
for those of old , and the late dignities heap 'd up to them , we rest your hermits .
where 's the propn of propn ?
we coursed him at the heels and had a purpose to be his purveyor ; but he rides well , and his great love , sharp as his spur , hath holp him to his home before us .
fair and noble hostess , we are your guest tonight .
your servants ever have theirs , themselves , and what is theirs , in compt , to make their audit at your highness ’ pleasure , still to return your own .
give me your hand ; conduct me to mine host .
we love him highly , and shall continue our graces towards him .
by your leave , hostess .
if it were done when ’ tis done , then ’ twere well it were done quickly .
this even - handed justice propn the ingredients of our poison 'd chalice to our own lips .
he has almost supp 'd .
why have you left the chamber ?
propn he ask 'd for me ?
know you not he has ?
was the hope drunk wherein you dress 'd yourself ?
propn it slept since ?
and wakes it now , to look so green and pale at what it did so freely ?
from this time such i account thy love .
art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valor as thou art in desire ?
propn thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament of life and live a coward in thine own esteem , letting “ i dare not ” wait upon “ i would ” like the poor cat i ’ the adage ?
prithee , peace !
i dare do all that may become a man ; who dares do more is none .
what beast was't then that made you break this enterprise to me ?
when you durst do it , then you were a man ; and , to be more than what you were , you would be so much more the man .
nor time nor place did then adhere , and yet you would make both : they have made themselves , and that their fitness now does unmake you .
if we should fail ?
we fail ?
but screw your courage to the sticking - place , and we 'll not fail .
when propn is asleep— propn the rather shall his day 's hard journey propn invite him — his two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince , that memory , the warder of the brain , shall be a fume and the receipt of reason a limbec only .
what not put upon his spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt of our great quell ?
bring forth men - children only , for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males .
will it not be received , when we have mark 'd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber , and used their very daggers , that they have done't ?
how goes the night , boy ?
and she goes down at twelve .
i take't ’ tis later , sir .
hold , take my sword .
take thee that too .
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me , and yet i would not sleep .
merciful powers , propn in me the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose !
give me my sword .
who 's there ?
a friend .
what , sir , not yet at rest ?
the propn 's a - bed .
being unprepared , our will became the servant to defect , which else should free have wrought .
all 's well .
at your kind'st leisure .
if you shall cleave to my consent , when ’ tis , it shall make honor for you .
good repose the while .
go bid thy mistress , when my drink is ready , she strike upon the bell .
get thee to bed .
is this a dagger which i see before me , the handle toward my hand ?
come , let me clutch thee .
i have thee not , and yet i see thee still .
art thou not , fatal vision , sensible to feeling as to sight ?
or art thou but a dagger of the mind , a false creation , proceeding from the heat - oppressed brain ?
i see thee yet , in form as palpable as this which now i draw .
thou marshall'st me the way that i was going , and such an instrument i was to use .
mine eyes are made the fools o ’ the other senses , or else worth all the rest .
i see thee still , and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood , which was not so before .
thou sure and firm - set earth , hear not my steps , which way they walk , for fear propn very stones prate of my whereabout , and take the present horror from the time , which now suits with it .
propn i threat , he lives ; words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives .
i go , and it is done : the bell invites me .
hear it not , propn , for it is a knell that summons thee to propn , or to hell .
propn !
peace !
it was the owl that shriek 'd , the fatal bellman , which gives the stern'st good - night .
he is about it : the doors are open , and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores : i have drugg 'd their possets , that death and nature do contend about them , whether they live or die .
who 's there ?
what , ho !
the attempt and not the deed confounds us .
propn !
had he not resembled my father as he slept , i had done't .
my husband !
i have done the deed .
propn thou not hear a noise ?
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
did not you speak ?
when ?
now .
as i descended ?
ay .
propn !
who lies i ’ the second chamber ?
propn .
this is a sorry sight .
there are two lodged together .
but wherefore could not i pronounce “ amen ” ?
i had most need of blessing , and “ amen ” stuck in my throat .
me thought i heard a voice cry “ sleep no more !
why , worthy propn , you do unbend your noble strength , to think so brainsickly of things .
go , get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand .
why did you bring these daggers from the place ?
they must lie there .
go carry them , and smear the sleepy grooms with blood .
infirm of purpose !
give me the daggers .
if he do bleed , i 'll gild the faces of the grooms withal , for it must seem their guilt .
whence is that knocking ?
how is't with me , when every noise appals me ?
what hands are here ?
ha , they pluck out mine eyes !
will all great propn 's ocean wash this blood propn from my hand ?
no , this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine , making the green one red .
my hands are of your color , but i shame to wear a heart so white .
propn we to our chamber .
your constancy propn left you unattended .
propn propn propn !
more knocking : get on your nightgown , lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers .
be not lost so poorly in your thoughts .
to know my deed , ’ twere best not know myself .
i would thou couldst !
here 's a knocking indeed !
if a man were porter of hell - gate , he should have old turning the key .
propn propn propn , knock , knock , knock !
who 's there , i ’ the name of propn ?
here 's a farmer that hanged himself on th ’ expectation of plenty .
propn propn propn , knock !
who 's there , in propn other devil 's name ?
faith , here 's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale , who committed treason enough for propn 's sake , yet could not equivocate to propn .
o , come in , equivocator .
propn propn propn , knock , knock !
who 's there ?
faith , here 's an english tailor come hither , for stealing out of a french hose .
come in , tailor ; here you may roast your goose .
propn propn propn , knock !
never at quiet !
what are you ?
but this place is too cold for hell .
i 'll devil - porter it no further .
i had thought to have let in some of all professions , that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire .
propn propn propn , anon !
i pray you , remember the porter .
was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , that you do lie so late ?
what three things does drink especially provoke ?
marry , sir , nose - painting , sleep , and urine .
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
that it did , sir , i ’ the very throat on me : but i requited him for his lie , and , i think , being too strong for him , though he took up my legs sometime , yet i made a shift to cast him .
is thy master stirring ?
good morrow , noble sir .
good morrow , both .
is the propn stirring , worthy propn ?
not yet .
i 'll bring you to him .
i know this is a joyful trouble to you ; but yet ’ tis one .
the labor we delight in physics pain .
this is the door .
i 'll make so bold to call , for ’ tis my limited service .
goes the propn hence today ?
the night has been unruly .
twas a rough night .
my young remembrance can not parallel a fellow to it .
o horror , horror , horror !
tongue nor heart can not conceive nor name thee .
what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter ?
confusion now hath made his masterpiece .
most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the propn 's anointed temple and stole thence the life o ’ the building .
what is't you say ?
the life ?
mean you his propn ?
approach the chamber , and destroy your sight with a new propn .
propn , awake !
ring the alarum bell .
murder and treason !
propn and propn !
shake off this downy sleep , death 's counterfeit , and look on death itself !
up , up , and see the great doom 's image !
propn !
banquo !
as from your graves rise up , and walk like sprites , to countenance this horror !
what 's the business , that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley the sleepers of the house ?
speak , speak !
o propn , propn !
our royal master 's murdered .
woe , alas !
what , in our house ?
too cruel any where .
propn propn , i prithee , contradict thyself , and say it is not so .
what is amiss ?
your royal father 's murdered .
o , by whom ?
o , yet i do repent me of my fury , that i did kill them .
propn did you so ?
who can be wise , amazed , temperate and furious , loyal and neutral , in a moment ?
who could refrain , that had a heart to love , and in that heart courage to make 's love known ?
help me hence , ho !
look to the lady .
why do we hold our tongues , that most may claim this argument for ours ?
what should be spoken here , where our fate , hid in an auger - hole , may rush and seize us ?
nor our strong sorrow [ aside to propn .
and so do i .
so all .
what will you do ?
to propn , i ; our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer .
this murderous shaft that 's shot propn not yet lighted , and our safest way is to avoid the aim .
therefore to horse ; and let us not be dainty of leave - taking , but shift away .
there 's warrant in that theft which steals itself when there 's no mercy left .
ah , good father , thou seest the heavens , as troubled with man 's act , threaten his bloody stage .
propn unnatural , even like the deed that 's done .
on propn last a falcon towering in her pride of place was by a mousing owl hawk 'd at and kill 'd .
and propn 's horses — a thing most strange and certain— beauteous and swift , the minions of their race , propn wild in nature , broke their stalls , flung out , contending ’ gainst obedience , as they would make propn with mankind .
propn said they eat each other .
they did so , to the amazement of mine eyes that look 'd upo n't .
here comes the good propn .
how goes the world , sir , now ?
why , see you not ?
is't known who did this more than bloody deed ?
those that propn hath slain .
alas , the day !
what good could they pretend ?
gainst nature still !
thriftless ambition , that wilt ravin up propn own life 's means !
then ’ tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon propn .
he is already named , and gone to propn to be invested .
where is propn 's body ?
carried to propn , the sacred storehouse of his predecessors and guardian of their bones .
will you to propn ?
no , cousin , i 'll to propn .
well , i will thither .
well , may you see things well done there , propn , lest our old robes sit easier than our new !
propn , father .
propn 's benison go with you and with those that would make good of bad and friends of foes !
if there come truth from them— as upon thee , propn , their speeches shine— why , by the verities on thee made good , may they not be my oracles as well and set me up in hope ?
but hush , no more .
here 's our chief guest .
if he had been forgotten , it had been as a gap in our great feast and all - thing unbecoming .
tonight we hold a solemn supper , sir , and i 'll request your presence .
let your propn propn upon me , to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie forever knit .
ride you this afternoon ?
ay , my good lord .
we should have else desired your good advice , which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this day 's council ; but we 'll take tomorrow .
is't far you ride ?
as far , my lord , as will fill up the time propn this and supper .
go not my horse the better , i must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain .
fail not our feast .
my lord , i will not .
we hear our bloody cousins are bestow 'd in propn and in propn , not confessing their cruel parricide , filling their hearers with strange invention .
but of that tomorrow , when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly .
goes fleance with you ?
ay , my good lord .
our time does call upon 's .
i wish your horses swift and sure of foot , and so i do commend you to their backs .
propn .
while then , propn be with you !
propn , a word with you .
attend those men our pleasure ?
they are , my lord , without the palace gate .
bring them before us .
to be thus is nothing , but to be safely thus .
our fears in propn propn deep , and in his royalty of nature propn that which would be fear 'd .
propn much he dares , and , to that dauntless temper of his mind , he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor to act in safety .
if't be so , for propn 's issue have i filed my mind , for them the gracious propn have i murdered , put rancors in the vessel of my peace only for them , and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man , to make them kings , the seed of propn kings !
rather than so , come , propn , into the list , and champion me to the utterance !
who 's there ?
now go to the door , and stay there till we call .
was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
it was , so please your highness .
well then , now have you consider 'd of my speeches ?
know that it was he , in the times past , which held you so under fortune , which you thought had been our innocent self ?
i did so , and went further , which is now our point of second meeting .
do you find your patience so predominant in your nature , that you can let this go ?
are you so gospell 'd , to pray for this good man and for his issue , whose heavy hand hath bow 'd you to the grave and beggar 'd yours for ever ?
we are men , my liege .
ay , in the catalogue ye go for men , as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , curs , propn , waterrugs , and demi - wolves are clept all by the name of dogs .
i am one , my liege , whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world .
and i another so weary with disasters , tugg 'd with fortune , that i would set my life on any chance , to mend it or be rid on propn .
both of you know propn was your enemy .
true , my lord .
so is he mine , and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life : and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it , yet i must not , for certain friends that are both his and mine , whose loves i may not drop , but wail his fall who i myself struck down .
and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love , masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons .
we shall , my lord , perform what you command us .
though our lives— your spirits shine through you .
resolve yourselves apart : i 'll come to you anon .
we are resolved , my lord .
i 'll call upon you straight .
abide within .
it is concluded : propn , thy soul 's flight , if it find propn , must find it out tonight .
is propn gone from court ?
ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
say to the propn i would attend his leisure for a few words .
propn , i will .
propn 's had , all 's spent , where our desire is got without content .
propn safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
how now , my lord !
why do you keep alone , of sorriest fancies your companions making , using those thoughts which should indeed have died with them they think on ?
things without all remedy should be without regard .
what 's done is done .
but let the frame of things disjoint , both the worlds suffer , propn we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly .
better be with the dead , whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy .
come on , propn my lord , sleek o'er your rugged looks ; be bright and jovial among your guests tonight .
you must leave this .
o , full of scorpions is my mind , dear wife !
thou propn that propn and his propn lives .
but in them nature 's copy 's not eterne .
there 's comfort yet ; they are assailable .
then be thou jocund .
ere the bat hath flown his cloister 'd flight ; ere to black propn 's summons the shard - borne beetle with his drowsy hums propn rung night 's yawning peal , there shall be done a deed of dreadful note .
what 's to be done ?
be innocent of the knowledge , dearest chuck , till thou applaud the deed .
come , seeling night , propn up the tender eye of pitiful day , and with thy bloody and invisible hand propn and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale !
thou marvell'st at my words , but hold thee still : things bad begun make strong themselves by ill .
so , prithee , go with me .
but who did bid thee join with us ?
propn .
he needs not our mistrust , since he delivers our offices and what we have to do , to the direction just .
then stand with us .
the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day ; now spurs the lated traveller apace to gain the timely inn , and near approaches the subject of our watch .
propn !
i hear horses .
give us a light there , ho !
then ’ tis he : the rest that are within the note of expectation already are i ’ the court .
his horses go about .
a light , a light !
propn he .
stand to't .
it will be rain tonight .
let it come down .
o , treachery !
fly , good propn , fly , fly , fly !
thou mayst revenge .
o slave !
who did strike out the light ?
we have lost best half of our affair .
well , let 's away and say how much is done .
at first and last the hearty welcome .
thanks to your propn .
ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host .
our hostess keeps her state , but in best time we will require her welcome .
pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends , for my heart speaks they are welcome .
see , they encounter thee with their hearts ’ thanks .
there 's blood upon thy face .
propn propn 's then .
propn better thee without than he within .
is he dispatch 'd ?
if thou didst it , thou art the nonpareil .
most royal sir , propn is ' scaped .
ay , my good lord .
thanks for that .
there the grown serpent lies ; the worm that 's fled propn nature that in time will venom breed , no teeth for the present .
get thee gone .
tomorrow we 'll hear ourselves again .
my royal lord , you do not give the cheer .
the feast is sold that is not often vouch 'd , while ’ tis a - making , ’ tis given with welcome .
to feed were best at home ; from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony ; propn were bare without it .
sweet remembrancer !
now good digestion wait on appetite , and health on both !
propn please your highness sit .
propn : his absence , sir , propn blame upon his promise .
please't your highness to grace us with your royal company ?
the table 's full .
here is a place reserved , sir .
where ?
here , my good lord .
what is't that moves your highness ?
which of you have done this ?
what , my good lord ?
pray you , keep seat .
the fit is momentary ; upon a thought he will again be well .
are you a man ?
ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that which might appal the devil .
o , these flaws and starts , propn to true fear , would well become a woman 's story at a winter 's fire , authorized by her grandam .
shame itself !
why do you make such faces ?
when all 's done , you look but on a stool .
prithee , see there !
behold !
look !
propn !
how say you ?
why , what care i ?
if thou canst nod , speak too .
if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back , our monuments shall be the maws of kites .
propn , for shame !
this is more strange than such a murder is .
my worthy lord , your noble friends do lack you .
i do forget .
do not muse at me , my most worthy friends .
i have a strange infirmity , which is nothing to those that know me .
come , love and health to all ; then i 'll sit down .
give me some wine , fill full .
i drink to the general joy o ’ the whole table , and to our dear friend propn , whom we miss .
would he were here !
to all and him we thirst , and all to all .
propn , and quit my sight !
let the earth hide thee !
think of this , good peers , but as a thing of custom .
what man dare , i dare .
or be alive again , and dare me to the desert with thy sword .
if trembling i inhabit then , protest me the baby of a girl .
hence , horrible shadow !
unreal mockery , hence !
why , so : being gone , i am a man again .
pray you , sit still .
you have displaced the mirth , broke the good meeting , with most admired disorder .
can such things be , and overcome us like a summer 's cloud , without our special wonder ?
you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe , when now i think you can behold such sights , and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanch 'd with fear .
propn : what sights , my lord ?
at once , good night : stand not upon the order of your going , but go at once .
good night , and better health attend his propn !
a kind good night to all !
stones have been known to move and trees to speak ; augures and understood relations have by maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret'st man of blood .
what is the night ?
almost at odds with morning , which is which .
how say'st thou , that propn denies his person at our great bidding ?
did you send to him , sir ?
i hear it by the way , but i will send .
there 's not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee 'd .
i will tomorrow , and betimes i will , to the weird sisters .
more shall they speak ; for now i am bent to know , by the worst means , the worst .
for mine own good all causes shall give way .
i am in blood propn in so far that , should i wade no more , returning were as tedious as go o'er .
strange things i have in head that will to hand , which must be acted ere they may be scann 'd .
you lack the season of all natures , sleep .
come , we 'll to sleep .
we are yet but young in deed .
why , how now , propn ?
you look angerly .
have i not reason , beldams as you are , propn and overbold ?
how did you dare to trade and traffic with propn in riddles and affairs of death ; and i , the mistress of your charms , the close contriver of all harms , was never call 'd to bear my part , or show the glory of our art ?
and , which is worse , all you have done propn been but for a wayward son , spiteful and wrathful : who , as others do , loves for his own ends , not for you .
but make amends now .
get you gone , and at the pit of propn propn me i ’ the morning .
thither he will come to know his destiny .
your vessels and your spells provide , your charms and every thing beside .
and that distill 'd by magic sleights shall raise such artificial sprites as by the strength of their illusion shall draw him on to his confusion .
he shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear his hopes ’ bove wisdom , grace , and fear .
and you all know security is mortals ’ chiefest enemy .
music , and a song propn , and a song propn !
and the right valiant propn walk 'd too late , whom , you may say , if't please you , fleance kill 'd , for propn fled .
men must not walk too late .
who can not want the thought , how monstrous it was for propn and for propn to kill their gracious father ?
damned fact !
how it did grieve propn !
did he not straight , in pious rage , the two delinquents tear , that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep ?
was not that nobly done ?
ay , and wisely too , for propn have anger 'd any heart alive to hear the men deny't .
so that , i say , he has borne all things well ; and i do think that , had he propn 's sons under his key— as , a n't please propn , he shall not — they should find what ’ twere to kill a father ; so should fleance .
but , peace !
for from broad words , and ’ cause he fail 'd his presence at the tyrant 's feast , i hear , propn lives in disgrace .
propn , can you tell where he bestows himself ?
the son of propn , from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth , lives in the english court and is received of the most pious propn with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect .
and this report propn so exasperate the king that he prepares for some attempt of war .
sent he to propn ?
some holy angel fly to the court of propn and unfold his message ere he come , that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed !
i 'll send my prayers with him .
thrice the brinded cat hath mew 'd .
thrice and once the hedge - pig whined .
toad , that under cold stone days and nights has thirty - one propn venom sleeping got , propn thou first i ’ the charmed pot .
double , double , toil and trouble ; fire burn and cauldron bubble .
fillet of a fenny snake , in the cauldron boil and bake ; propn of newt and toe of frog , wool of bat and tongue of dog , propn 's fork and blind - worm 's sting , propn 's leg and howlet 's wing , for a charm of powerful trouble , like a hell - broth boil and bubble .
double , double , toil and trouble ; fire burn and cauldron bubble .
scale of dragon , tooth of wolf , propn 's mummy , maw and gulf of the ravin 'd salt - sea shark , propn of hemlock digg 'd i ’ the dark , propn of blaspheming propn , propn of goat and slips of yew propn in the moon 's eclipse , propn of propn and propn 's lips , propn of birth - strangled babe propn - propn by a drab , make the gruel thick and slab .
add thereto a tiger 's chaudron , for the ingredients of our cauldron .
double , double , toil and trouble ; fire burn and cauldron bubble .
cool it with a baboon 's blood , then the charm is firm and good .
o , well done !
how now , you secret , black , and midnight hags ?
what is't you do ?
a deed without a name .
i conjure you , by that which you profess , howe'er you come to know it , answer me : though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches , though the yeasty waves propn and swallow navigation up , propn bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down , though castles topple on their warders ’ heads , propn palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations , though the treasure of nature 's germens tumble all together even till destruction sicken , answer me to what i ask you .
speak .
demand .
we 'll answer .
say , if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths , or from our masters ?
pour in sow 's blood that hath eaten her nine farrow ; grease that 's sweaten from the murderer 's gibbet throw into the flame .
come , high or low ; thyself and office deftly show !
propn !
propn !
propn !
beware propn ; beware the propn of propn .
dismiss me .
enough .
propn thou art , for thy good caution , thanks ; thou hast harp 'd my fear aright .
here 's another , more potent than the first .
propn !
propn !
propn !
had i three ears , i 'd hear thee .
what need i fear of thee ?
what is this , that rises like the issue of a king , and wears upon his baby brow the round and top of sovereignty ?
listen , but speak not to't .
that will never be .
who can impress the forest , bid the tree propn his earth - bound root ?
sweet bodements , good !
propn 's head , rise never , till the propn of propn rise , and our high - placed propn shall live the lease of nature , pay his breath to time and mortal custom .
seek to know no more .
i will be satisfied !
deny me this , and an eternal curse fall on you !
show !
show !
thou are too like the spirit of propn .
down !
thy crown does sear mine eyeballs .
filthy hags !
why do you show me this ?
a fourth !
start , eyes !
what , will the line stretch out to the crack of doom ?
another yet !
a seventh !
now i see ’ tis true ; for the blood - bolter 'd propn smiles upon me , and points at them for his .
ay , sir , all this is so .
but why propn propn thus amazedly ?
come , sisters , cheer we up his sprites , and show the best of our delights .
i 'll charm the air to give a sound , while you perform your antic round , that this great propn may kindly say our duties did his welcome pay .
where are they ?
gone ?
let this pernicious hour stand aye accursed in the calendar !
come in , without there !
what 's your grace 's will ?
saw you the weird sisters ?
no , my lord .
came they not by you ?
no indeed , my lord .
infected be the air whereon they ride , and damn 'd all those that trust them !
i did hear the galloping of horse .
who was't came by ?
propn two or three , my lord , that bring you word propn is fled to propn .
fled to propn ?
ay , my good lord .
propn , thou anticipatest my dread exploits .
propn , thou the flighty purpose never is o'ertook unless the deed go with it .
from this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand .
no boasting like a fool ; this deed i 'll do before this purpose cool .
come , bring me where they are .
what had he done , to make him fly the land ?
you must have patience , madam .
when our actions do not , our fears do make us traitors .
you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
wisdom ?
to leave his wife , to leave his babes , his mansion , and his titles , in a place from whence himself does fly ?
my dearest coz , i pray you , school yourself .
but for your husband , he is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows the fits o ’ the season .
things at the worst will cease , or else climb upward to what they were before .
my pretty cousin , blessing upon you !
propn he is , and yet he 's fatherless .
i am so much a fool , should i stay longer , it would be my disgrace and your discomfort .
i take my leave at once .
how will you live ?
as birds do , propn .
what , with worms and flies ?
with what i get , i mean ; and so do they .
poor bird !
propn never fear the net nor lime , the pitfall nor the gin .
why should i , propn ?
poor birds they are not set for .
my father is not dead , for all your saying .
yes , he is dead .
how wilt thou do for a father ?
nay , how will you do for a husband ?
why , i can buy me twenty at any market .
then you 'll buy ’ em to sell again .
thou speak'st with all thy wit , and yet , i ’ faith , with wit enough for thee .
was my father a traitor , propn ?
ay , that he was .
what is a traitor ?
why , one that swears and lies .
and be all traitors that do so ?
everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged .
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
every one .
who must hang them ?
why , the honest men .
then the liars and swearers are fools ; for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them .
now , propn help thee , poor monkey !
but how wilt thou do for a father ?
poor prattler , how thou talk'st !
bless you , fair dame !
i am not to you known , propn , in your state of honor i am perfect .
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly .
if you will take a homely man 's advice , be not found here ; hence , with your little ones .
propn preserve you !
i dare abide no longer .
propn should i fly ?
i have done no harm .
but i remember now i am in this earthly world , where to do harm is often laudable , to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly .
where is your husband ?
i hope , in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him .
he 's a traitor .
thou liest , thou shag - ear 'd villain !
what , you egg !
young fry of treachery !
he has kill 'd me , propn .
run away , i pray you !
let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty .
let us rather hold fast the mortal sword , and like good men bestride our downfall'n birthdom .
each new morn propn widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows strike heaven on the face , that it resounds as if it felt with propn and yell 'd out like syllable of dolor .
what you have spoke , it may be so perchance .
this tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , was once thought honest .
you have loved him well ; he hath not touch 'd you yet .
i am young , but something you may deserve of him through me , and wisdom to offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb to appease an angry god .
i am not treacherous .
but propn is .
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge .
angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , yet grace must still look so .
i have lost my hopes .
perchance even there where i did find my doubts .
why in that rawness left you wife and child , those precious motives , those strong knots of love , without leave - taking ?
i pray you , let not my jealousies be your dishonors , but mine own safeties .
you may be rightly just , whatever i shall think .
propn , bleed , poor country !
great tyranny , lay thou thy basis sure , for goodness dare not check thee .
wear thou thy wrongs ; the title is affeer 'd .
fare thee well , lord .
i would not be the villain that thou think'st for the whole space that 's in the tyrant 's grasp and the rich propn to boot .
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke ; it weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash is added to her wounds .
i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right ; and here from gracious propn have i offer of goodly thousands .
but for all this , when i shall tread upon the tyrant 's head , or wear it on my sword , yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before , more suffer and more sundry ways than ever , by him that shall succeed .
what should he be ?
it is myself i mean , in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that , when they shall be open 'd , black propn will seem as pure as snow , and the poor state propn him as a lamb , being compared with my confineless harms .
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damn 'd in evils to top propn .
i grant him bloody , luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin that has a name .
but there 's no bottom , none , in my voluptuousness .
your wives , your daughters , your matrons , and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust , and my desire all continent impediments would o'erbear that did oppose my will .
propn propn than such an one to reign .
but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours .
you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty and yet seem cold , the time you may so hoodwink .
we have willing dames enough ; there can not be that vulture in you , to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves , finding it so inclined .
with this there grows in my most ill - composed affection such a stanchless avarice that , were i propn , i should cut off the nobles for their lands , propn his jewels and this other 's house , and my more - having would be as a sauce to make me hunger more , that i should forge propn unjust against the good and loyal , destroying them for wealth .
this avarice sticks deeper , grows with more pernicious root than summer - seeming lust , and it hath been the sword of our slain kings .
yet do not fear ; scotland hath foisons to fill up your will of your mere own .
all these are portable , with other graces weigh 'd .
but i have none .
the king - becoming graces , as justice , verity , temperance , stableness , propn , perseverance , mercy , lowliness , devotion , patience , courage , fortitude , i have no relish of them , but abound in the division of each several crime , acting it many ways .
nay , had i power , i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell , propn the universal peace , confound all unity on earth .
o propn , propn !
if such a one be fit to govern , speak .
i am as i have spoken .
fit to govern ?
no , not to live .
propn royal father was a most sainted king : the queen that bore thee , propn upon her knees than on her feet , died every day she lived .
fare thee well !
these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself have banish 'd me from propn .
o my breast , propn hope ends here !
propn , this noble passion , child of integrity , hath from my soul wiped the black scruples , reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honor .
propn propn by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power , and modest wisdom plucks me from over - credulous haste .
but propn above propn between thee and me !
for even now i put myself to thy direction and propn mine own detraction ; here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself , for strangers to my nature .
i am yet unknown to woman , never was forsworn , scarcely have coveted what was mine own , at no time broke my faith , would not betray the devil to his fellow , and delight no less in truth than life .
my first false speaking was this upon myself .
what i am truly , is thine and my poor country 's to command : propn indeed , before thy here - approach , propn propn , with ten thousand warlike men , already at a point , was setting forth .
now we 'll together , and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel !
why are you silent ?
such welcome and unwelcome things at once ’ tis hard to reconcile .
well , more anon .
comes the propn forth , i pray you ?
i thank you , propn .
what 's the disease he means ?
propn call 'd the evil : a most miraculous work in this good propn , which often , since my here - remain in propn , i have seen him do .
with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy , and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace .
see , who comes here ?
my countryman : but yet i know him not .
my ever gentle cousin , welcome hither .
i know him now .
good propn , betimes remove the means that makes us strangers !
propn , amen .
propn propn where it did ?
alas , poor country , almost afraid to know itself !
it can not be call 'd our mother , but our grave .
where nothing , but who knows nothing , is once seen to smile ; where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air , are made , not mark 'd ; where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy .
the dead man 's knell is there scarce ask 'd for who , and good men 's lives propn before the flowers in their caps , dying or ere they sicken .
o , relation too nice , and yet too true !
what 's the newest grief ?
that of an hour 's age doth hiss the speaker ; each minute teems a new one .
how does my wife ?
why , well .
and all my children ?
well too .
the tyrant has not batter 'd at their peace ?
no ; they were well at peace when i did leave ’ em .
be't their comfort we are coming thither .
would i could answer this comfort with the like !
but i have words that would be howl 'd out in the desert air , where hearing should not latch them .
what concern they ?
the general cause ?
or is it a fee - grief due to some single breast ?
no mind that 's honest but in it shares some woe , though the main part propn to you alone .
let not your ears despise my tongue for ever , which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard .
your castle is surprised ; your wife and babes savagely slaughter 'd .
to relate the manner were , on the quarry of these murder 'd deer , to add the death of you .
merciful heaven !
what , man !
ne'er pull your hat upon your brows ; give sorrow words .
the grief that does not speak whispers the propn fraught heart , and bids it break .
my children too ?
wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
and i must be from thence !
my wife kill 'd too ?
i have said .
be comforted .
let 's make us medicines of our great revenge , to cure this deadly grief .
he has no children .
all my pretty ones ?
did you say all ?
o hell - kite !
all ?
what , all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop ?
dispute it like a man .
i shall do so ; but i must also feel it as a man .
i can not but remember such things were , that were most precious to me .
did propn look on , and would not take their part ?
propn propn , they were all struck for thee !
propn that i am , not for their own demerits , but for mine , propn slaughter on their souls .
propn rest them now !
be this the whetstone of your sword .
o , i could play the woman with mine eyes , and braggart with my tongue !
this tune goes manly .
come , go we to the king ; our power is ready ; our lack is nothing but our leave .
propn is ripe for shaking , and the powers above put on their instruments .
i have two nights watched with you , but can perceive no truth in your report .
when was it she last walked ?
since his propn went into the field , i have seen her rise from her bed , throw her nightgown upon her , unlock her closet , take forth paper , fold it , write upo n't , read it , afterwards seal it , and again return to bed ; yet all this while in a most fast sleep .
a great perturbation in nature , to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching !
in this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
that , sir , which i will not report after her .
you may to me , and ’ tis most meet you should .
neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
propn you , here she comes !
this is her very guise , and , upon my life , fast asleep .
observe her ; stand close .
how came she by that light ?
why , it stood by her .
she has light by her continually ; ’ tis her command .
you see , her eyes are open .
ay , but their sense is shut .
what is it she does now ?
look how she rubs her hands .
it is an accustomed action with her , to seem thus washing her hands .
i have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour .
yet here 's a spot .
propn , she speaks !
i will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
out , damned spot !
out , i say !
one – two— why then ’ tis time to do't .
hell is murky .
propn , my lord , fie !
a soldier , and afeard ?
what need we fear who knows it , when none can call our power to account ?
yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him ?
do you mark that ?
the propn of propn had a wife ; where is she now ?
what , will these hands ne'er be clean ?
no more o ’ that , my lord , no more o ’ that .
you mar all with this starting .
go to , go to ; you have known what you should not .
she has spoke what she should not , i am sure of that .
propn knows what she has known .
here 's the smell of the blood still .
all the perfumes of propn will not sweeten this little hand .
oh , oh , oh !
what a sigh is there !
the heart is sorely charged .
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
well , well , well— pray propn it be , sir .
this disease is beyond my practice .
yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
wash your hands , put on your nightgown ; look not so pale .
i tell you yet again , propn 's buried ; he can not come out on 's grave .
even so ?
to bed , to bed ; there 's knocking at the gate .
come , come , come , come , give me your hand .
what 's done can not be undone .
to bed , to bed , to bed .
will she go now to bed ?
directly .
foul whisperings are abroad .
propn , propn , forgive us all !
good night , good doctor .
the english power is near , led on by propn , his uncle propn , and the good propn .
revenges burn in them , for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm propn the mortified man .
propn propn propn propn we well meet them ; that way are they coming .
who knows if propn be with his brother ?
there is propn 's son and many unrough youths , that even now protest their first of manhood .
what does the tyrant ?
great propn he strongly fortifies .
now does he feel his title propn loose about him , like a giant 's robe upon a dwarfish thief .
who then shall blame his pester 'd senses to recoil and start , when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there ?
well , march we on , to give obedience where ’ tis truly owed .
propn we the medicine of the sickly weal , and with him pour we , in our country 's purge , each drop of us .
or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds .
make we our march towards birnam
bring me no more reports ; let them fly all !
till propn propn remove to propn i can not taint with fear .
what 's the boy propn ?
was he not born of woman ?
the mind i sway by and the heart i bear propn never sag with doubt nor shake with fear .
the devil damn thee black , thou cream - faced loon !
where got'st thou that goose look ?
soldiers , sir .
go prick thy face and over - red thy fear , thou lily - liver 'd boy .
what soldiers , patch ?
death of thy soul !
those linen cheeks of thine are counselors to fear .
what soldiers , whey - face ?
the english force , so please you .
take thy face hence .
propn — i am sick at heart , when i behold — propn , i say ! —this push will cheer me ever or disseat me now .
i have lived long enough .
my way of life is fall'n into the sear , the yellow leaf , and that which should accompany old age , as honor , love , obedience , troops of friends , i must not look to have ; but , in their stead , propn , not loud but deep , mouth - honor , breath , which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not .
propn !
what 's your gracious pleasure ?
what news more ?
all is confirm 'd , my lord , which was reported .
i 'll fight , ’ til from my bones my flesh be hack 'd .
give me my armor .
propn not needed yet .
i 'll put it on .
give me mine armor .
how does your patient , doctor ?
not so sick , my lord , as she is troubled with thick - coming fancies , that keep her from her rest .
cure her of that .
therein the patient must minister to himself .
throw physic to the dogs , i 'll none of it .
propn , send out .
doctor , the thanes fly from me .
come , sir , dispatch .
if thou couldst , doctor , cast the water of my land , find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health , i would applaud thee to the very echo , that should applaud again .
pull't off , i say .
what rhubarb , senna , or what purgative drug would scour these propn hence ?
propn thou of them ?
bring it after me .
i will not be afraid of death and bane propn propn propn come to propn .
propn , i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe .
we doubt it nothing .
what wood is this before us ?
the propn of propn .
it shall be done .
we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in propn , and will endure our setting down before't .
let our just censures attend the true event , and put we on industrious soldiership .
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate , but certain issue strokes must arbitrate ; towards which , advance the war .
here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up .
were they not forced with those that should be ours , we might have met them dareful , beard to beard , and beat them backward home .
what is that noise ?
it is the cry of women , my good lord .
propn was that cry ?
the propn , my lord , is dead .
out , out , brief candle !
life 's but a walking shadow , a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more .
it is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .
gracious my lord , i should report that which i say i saw , but know not how to do it .
well , say , sir .
as i did stand my watch upon the hill , i look 'd toward propn , and anon , methought , the propn began to move .
liar and slave !
let me endure your wrath , if't be not so .
within this three mile may you see it coming ; i say , a moving grove .
i pull in resolution and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth .
fear not , till propn propn do come to propn , ” and now a wood comes toward propn .
arm , arm , and out !
if this which he avouches does appear , there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here .
i ’ gin to be aweary of the sun and wish the estate o ’ the world were now undone .
ring the alarum bell !
blow , wind !
come , wrack !
at least we 'll die with harness on our back .
now near enough ; your leavy screens throw down , and show like those you are .
fare you well .
do we but find the tyrant 's power tonight , let us be beaten , if we can not fight .
what 's he that was not born of woman ?
such a one am i to fear , or none .
what is thy name ?
thou'lt be afraid to hear it .
my name 's propn .
the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear .
no , nor more fearful .
thou liest , abhorred tyrant ; with my sword i 'll prove the lie thou speak'st .
thou wast born of woman .
but swords i smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , propn by man that 's of a woman born .
that way the noise is .
propn , show thy face !
if thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine , my wife and children 's ghosts will haunt me still .
let me find him , fortune !
and more i beg not .
this way , my lord ; the castle 's gently render 'd .
the tyrant 's people on both sides do fight , the noble thanes do bravely in the war ; the day almost itself professes yours , and little is to do .
we have met with foes that strike beside us .
enter , sir , the castle .
why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword ?
propn i see lives , the gashes do better upon them .
turn , hell hound , turn !
of all men else i have avoided thee .
thou losest labor .
despair thy charm , and let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee , propn was from his mother 's womb untimely ripp 'd .
accursed be that tongue that tells me so , for it hath cow 'd my better part of man !
and be these juggling fiends no more believed , that palter with us in a double sense , that keep the word of promise to our ear , and break it to our hope .
i 'll not fight with thee .
then yield thee , coward , and live to be the show and gaze o ’ the time .
propn propn propn be come to propn , and thou opposed , being of no woman born , yet i will try the last .
before my body i throw my warlike shield !
propn is missing , and your noble son .
then he is dead ?
ay , and brought off the field .
your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth , for then it hath no end .
had he his hurts before ?
ay , on the front .
why then , propn 's soldier be he !
had i as many sons as i have hairs , i would not wish them to a fairer death .
and so his knell is knoll 'd .
here comes newer comfort .
propn where stands the usurper 's cursed head .
the time is free .
i see thee compass 'd with thy kingdom 's pearl that speak my salutation in their minds , whose voices i desire aloud with mine : propn , propn of propn !
propn , propn of propn !
we shall not spend a large expense of time before we reckon with your several loves , and make us even with you .
my thanes and kinsmen , henceforth be propn , the first that ever propn in such an honor named .
in sooth , i know not why i am so sad ; it wearies me ; you say it wearies you ; but how i caught it , found it , or came by it , what stuff ' tis made of , whereof it is born , i am to learn ; and such a want - wit sadness makes of me , that i have much ado to know myself .
your mind is tossing on the ocean ; there , where your argosies , with portly sail , — like signiors and rich burghers on the flood , or , as it were , the pageants of the sea , — do overpeer the petty traffickers , that curt'sy to them , do them reverence , as they fly by them with their woven wings .
believe me , sir , had i such venture forth , the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad .
i should be still plucking the grass , to know where sits the wind ; peering in maps , for ports , and piers , and roads : and every object that might make me fear propn to my ventures , out of doubt would make me sad .
my wind , cooling my broth , would blow me to an ague , when i thought what harm a wind too great might do at sea .
i should not see the sandy hour - glass run , but i should think of shallows and of flats ; and see my wealthy propn dock 'd in sand , vailing her high - top lower than her ribs , to kiss her burial .
should i go to church , and see the holy edifice of stone , and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks , which , touching but my gentle vessel 's side , would scatter all her spices on the stream , propn the roaring waters with my silks , and , in a word , but even now worth this , and now worth nothing ?
shall i have the thought to think on this ; and shall i lack the thought that such a thing , bechanc 'd , would make me sad ?
but tell not me ; i know , propn is sad to think upon his merchandise .
believe me , no ; i thank my fortune for it , my ventures are not in one bottom trusted , nor to one place ; nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year : therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
not in love neither ?
then let us say , you are sad , because you are not merry : and ' twere as easy for you to laugh , and leap , and say you are merry , because you are not sad .
now , by two - headed propn , propn hath fram 'd strange fellows in her time : some that will evermore peep through their eyes , and laugh , like parrots , at a bag - piper ; and other of such vinegar aspect , that they 'll not show their teeth in way of smile , propn propn swear the jest be laughable .
i would have stay 'd till i had made you merry , if worthier friends had not prevented me .
your worth is very dear in my regard .
i take it , your own business calls on you , and you embrace the occasion to depart .
good morrow , my good lords .
good signiors both , when shall we laugh ?
say , when ?
you grow exceeding strange : must it be so ?
we 'll make our leisures to attend on yours .
my propn propn , since you have found propn , we two will leave you ; but at dinner - time , i pray you have in mind where we must meet .
i will not fail you .
i hold the world but as the world , propn ; a stage , where every man must play a part , and mine a sad one .
well , we will leave you then till dinner - time .
i must be one of these same dumb wise men , for propn never lets me speak .
well , keep me company but two years more , propn shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue .
farewell : i 'll grow a talker for this gear .
thanks , i ' faith ; for silence is only commendable in a neat 's tongue dried , and a maid not vendible .
is that any thing now ?
well ; tell me now , what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage , that you to - day promis 'd to tell me of ?
propn not unknown to you , propn , how much i have disabled mine estate , by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance : nor do i now make moan to be abridg 'd from such a noble rate ; but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time , something too prodigal , propn left me gag 'd .
to you , propn , i owe the most in money and in love ; and from your love i have a warranty to unburthen all my plots and purposes , how to get clear of all the debts i owe .
i pray you , good propn , let me know it ; and , if it stand , as you yourself still do , within the eye of honour , be assur 'd , my purse , my person , my extremest means , lie all unlock 'd to your occasions .
in my schooldays , when i had lost one shaft , i shot his fellow of the self - same flight the self - same way , with more advised watch , to find the other forth ; and by adventuring both i oft found both : i urge this childhood proof , because what follows is pure innocence .
i owe you much ; and , like a wilful youth , that which i owe is lost : but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first , i do not doubt , as i will watch the aim , or to find both , or bring your latter hazard back again , and thankfully rest debtor for the first .
you know me well , and herein spend but time , to wind about my love with circumstance ; and , out of doubt , you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost , than if you had made waste of all i have .
then do but say to me what i should do , that in your knowledge may by me be done , and i am prest unto it : therefore speak .
in propn is a lady richly left , and she is fair , and , fairer than that word , of wondrous virtues .
nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth ; for the four winds blow in from every coast propn suitors , and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece ; which makes her seat of propn , propn ' strand , and many propn come in quest of her .
o , my antonio !
had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them , i have a mind presages me such thrift , that i should questionless be fortunate .
thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea ; neither have i money , nor commodity to raise a present sum : therefore go forth , try what my credit can in propn do ; that shall be rack 'd , even to the uttermost , to furnish thee to propn , to fair propn .
go , presently inquire , and so will i , where money is ; and i no question make , to have it of my trust , or for my sake .
by my troth , propn , my little body is a - weary of this great world .
you would be , sweet madam , if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are ; and yet , for aught i see , they are as sick that surfeit with too much , as they that starve with nothing .
it is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean ; superfluity comes sooner by white hairs , but competency lives longer .
good sentences , and well pronounced .
they would be better , if well followed .
if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do , chapels had been churches , and poor men 's cottages princes ' palaces .
it is a good divine that follows his own instructions : i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done , than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching .
the brain may devise laws for the blood ; but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree : such a hare is madness the youth , to skip propn the meshes of good counsel the cripple .
but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband : — o me , the word choose !
your father was ever virtuous ; and holy men at their death have good inspirations ; therefore , the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests , of gold , silver , and lead , ( whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you , ) will , no doubt , never be chosen by any rightly , but one who you shall rightly love .
but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come ?
ay , that 's a colt , indeed , for he doth nothing but talk of his horse ; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself : i am much afraid my lady his mother played false with a smith .
then , is there the county propn .
he doth nothing but frown ; as who should say , an you will not have me , choose ; he hears merry tales , and smiles not : i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .
i had rather be married to a death 's head with a bone in his mouth , than to either of these .
propn defend me from these two !
how say you by the french lord , propn propn propn ?
propn made him , and therefore let him pass for a man .
in truth , i know it is a sin to be a mocker ; but , he !
what say you then to propn , the young baron of propn ?
you know i say nothing to him ; for he understands not me , nor i him : he hath neither propn , propn , nor italian ; and you will come into the court , and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the propn .
how oddly he is suited !
i think he bought his doublet in propn , his round hose in propn , his bonnet in propn and his behaviour everywhere .
what think you of the scottish lord , his neighbour ?
that he hath a neighbourly charity in him ; for he borrowed a box of the ear of the propn , and swore he would pay him again when he was able : i think the propn became his surety , and sealed under for another .
how like you the young propn , the propn of propn 's nephew ?
very vilely in the morning , when he is sober ; and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk : when he is best , he is a little worse than a man ; and when he is worst , he is little better than a beast : and the worst fall that ever fell , i hope i shall make shift to go without him .
if he should offer to choose , and choose the right casket , you should refuse to perform your father 's will , if you should refuse to accept him .
therefore , for fear of the worst , i pray thee , set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket ; for , if the devil be within and that temptation without , i know he will choose it .
i will do anything , propn , ere i will be married to a sponge .
you need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords : they have acquainted me with their determinations : which is , indeed , to return to their home , and to trouble you with no more suit ; unless you may be won by some other sort than your father 's imposition , depending on the caskets .
if i live to be as old as propn i will die as chaste as propn , unless i be obtained by the manner of my father 's will .
i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable ; for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence , and i pray propn grant them a fair departure .
do you not remember , lady , in your father 's time , a propn , a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the propn of propn ?
yes , yes , it was bassanio ; as i think , so was he called .
true , madam ; he , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .
i remember him well ; and i remember him worthy of thy praise .
how now !
what news ?
the four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave : and there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the propn of propn ; who brings word , the prince , his master , will be here to - night .
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell , i should be glad of his approach : if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , i had rather he should shrive me than wive me .
come , propn .
three thousand ducats , — well .
ay , sir , for three months .
for three months , — well .
for the which , as i told you , propn shall be bound .
antonio shall become bound , — well .
may you stead me ?
will you pleasure me ?
shall i know your answer ?
three thousand ducats , for three months , and propn bound .
your answer to that .
antonio is a good man .
have you heard any imputation to the contrary ?
but ships are but boards , sailors but men : there be land - rats and water - rats , land - thieves and water - thieves ; i mean , pirates ; and then , there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks .
the man is , notwithstanding , sufficient ; — three thousand ducats ; —i think i may take his bond .
be assured you may .
i will be assured i may ; and that i may be assured , i will bethink me .
may i speak with propn ?
if it please you to dine with us .
yes , to smell pork ; to eat of the habitation which your prophet , the propn , conjured the devil into !
this is propn propn .
how like a fawning publican he looks !
i hate him for he is a propn : but more , for that , in low simplicity , he lends out money gratis , and brings down the rate of usance here with us in propn .
if i can catch him once upon the hip , i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him .
he hates our sacred nation ; and he rails , even there where merchants most do congregate , on me , my bargains , and my well - won thrift , which he calls interest .
cursed be my tribe if i forgive him !
propn , do you hear ?
i am debating of my present store : and , by the near guess of my memory , i can not instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats .
what of that ?
propn , a wealthy hebrew of my tribe , will furnish me .
shylock , albeit i neither lend nor borrow , by taking , nor by giving of excess , yet , to supply the ripe wants of my friend , i 'll break a custom : — is he yet possess 'd how much you would ?
ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
and for three months .
well then , your bond ; and , let me see .
but hear you : methought you said , you neither lend nor borrow , upon advantage .
i do never use it .
did he take interest ?
no , not take interest ; not , as you would say , directly interest : mark what propn did .
when propn and himself were compromis 'd that all the eanlings which were streak 'd and pied should fall , as propn 's hire ; the ewes , being rank , in the end of autumn turned to the rams : and when the work of generation was , between these woolly breeders , in the act , the skilful shepherd pill 'd me certain wands , and , in the doing of the deed of kind , he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes ; who , then conceiving , did in eaning - time fall party - colour 'd lambs , and those were propn 's .
this was a way to thrive , and he was blest ; and thrift is blessing , if men steal it not .
this was a venture , sir , that propn serv 'd for ; a thing not in his power to bring to pass , but sway 'd and fashion 'd by the hand of propn .
was this inserted to make interest good ?
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
i can not tell ; i make it breed as fast : but note me , signior .
propn you this , propn , the devil can cite scripture for his purpose .
an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek ; a goodly apple rotten at the heart ; o , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
three thousand ducats ; —'tis a good round sum .
three months from twelve , then let me see ; the rate .
well , propn , shall we be beholden to you ?
propn propn , many a time and oft , in the propn you have rated me about my moneys , and my usances : still have i borne it with a patient shrug , for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe : you call me , — misbeliever , cut - throat dog , and spet upon my jewish gaberdine , and all for use of that which is mine own .
well then , it now appears you need my help : go to then : you come to me , and you say , propn , we would have monies ; you say so ; you , that did void your rheum upon my beard , and foot me , as you spurn a stranger cur over your threshold ; monies is your suit .
what should i say to you ?
should i not say , propn a dog money ?
why , look you , how you storm !
this were kindness .
content , in faith ; i 'll seal to such a bond , and say there is much kindness in the propn .
you shall not seal to such a bond for me ; i 'll rather dwell in my necessity .
why , fear not , man , i will not forfeit it ; within these two months , — that 's a month before this bond expires , — i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond .
o father propn , what these propn are , whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect the thoughts of others !
pray you , tell me this ; if he should break his day , what should i gain by the exaction of the forfeiture ?
a pound of man 's flesh , taken from a man , is not so estimable , profitable neither , as flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats .
i say , to buy his favour , i extend this friendship ; if he will take it , so ; if not , adieu ; and , for my love , i pray you wrong me not .
yes , propn , i will seal unto this bond .
then meet me forthwith at the notary 's ; give him direction for this merry bond , and i will go and purse the ducats straight ; see to my house , left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave ; and presently i will be with you .
hie thee , gentle propn .
this propn will turn propn ; he grows kind .
i like not fair terms and a villain 's mind .
come on ; in this there can be no dismay , my ships come home a month before the day .
mislike me not for my complexion , the shadowed livery of the burnish 'd sun , to whom i am a neighbour , and near bred .
bring me the fairest creature northward born , where propn ' fire scarce thaws the icicles , and let us make incision for your love , to prove whose blood is reddest , his , or mine .
in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden 's eyes : besides , the lottery of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing : but , if my father had not scanted me , and hedg 'd me by his wit , to yield myself his wife , who wins me by that means i told you , yourself , renowned prince , then stood as fair as any comer i have look 'd on yet , for my affection .
even for that i thank you ; therefore , i pray you , lead me to the caskets , to try my fortune .
by this scimitar , — that slew the propn , and a persian prince , that won three fields of propn solyman , — i would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look , propn the heart most daring on the earth , propn the young sucking cubs from the she - bear , propn , mock the lion when he roars for prey , to win thee , lady .
but , alas the while !
if propn and propn play at dice which is the better man , the greater throw propn turn by fortune from the weaker hand : so is alcides beaten by his page ; and so may i , blind fortune leading me , propn that which one unworthier may attain , and die with grieving .
you must take your chance ; and either not attempt to choose at all , or swear , before you choose , — if you choose wrong , never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage ; therefore be advis 'd .
first , forward to the temple ; after dinner your hazard shall be made .
to make me bless 'd , or cursed'st among men .
certainly , my conscience will serve me to run from this propn , my master .
the fiend is at mine elbow , and tempts me ; saying to me , — propn , propn propn , good launcelot , or good propn , or good propn propn , use your legs , take the start , run away .— my conscience says , no ; take heed , honest launcelot ; take heed , honest propn ; or , ( as aforesaid ) honest launcelot propn ; do not run : scorn running with thy heels : well , the most courageous fiend bids me pack ; propn !
says the fiend ; away !
propn , young man , you ; i pray you , which is the way to master propn 's ?
o heavens , this is my true - begotten father !
who , being more than sand - blind , high - gravel blind , knows me not : i will try confusions with him .
propn , young gentleman , i pray you which is the way to master propn 's ?
turn up on your right hand at the next turning , but , at the next turning of all , on your left ; marry , at the very next turning , turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the propn 's house .
by propn 's sonties , ' twill be a hard way to hit .
can you tell me whether one launcelot , that dwells with him , dwell with him , or no ?
talk you of young propn propn ? — mark me now — now will i raise the waters .— talk you of young master launcelot ?
no master , sir , but a poor man 's son : his father , though i say it , is an honest exceeding poor man , and , propn be thanked , well to live .
well , let his father be what a will , we talk of young master launcelot .
your worship 's friend and propn , sir .
but i pray you ergo , old man , ergo , i beseech you , talk you of young master launcelot .
of propn , a n't please your mastership .
marry , propn forbid !
the boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .
do i look like a cudgel , or a hovel - post , a staff , or a prop ?
do you know me , father ?
do you not know me , father ?
propn , sir , i am sand - blind , i know you not .
nay , indeed , if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me : it is a wise father that knows his own child .
pray you , sir , stand up ; i am sure you are not launcelot , my boy .
pray you , let 's have no more fooling about it , but give me your blessing ; i am propn , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be .
i can not think you are my son .
i know not what i shall think of that : but i am propn , the propn 's man ; and i am sure propn , your wife , is my mother .
her name is propn , indeed : i 'll be sworn , if thou be launcelot , thou art mine own flesh and blood .
thou hast got more hair on thy chin than dobbin my phill - horse has on his tail .
it should seem then , that propn 's tail grows backward : i am sure he had more hair of his tail , than i have of my face , when i last saw him .
how dost thou and thy master agree ?
i have brought him a present .
how ' gree you now ?
well , well ; but , for mine own part , as i have set up my rest to run away , so i will not rest till i have run some ground .
my master 's a very propn .
give him a halter : i am famished in his service ; you may tell every finger i have with my ribs .
here comes the man ; — to him , father ; for i am a propn if i serve the propn any longer .
you may do so : — but let it be so hasted , that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock .
see these letters delivered ; put the liveries to making ; and desire propn to come anon to my lodging .
to him , father .
propn bless your worship !
wouldst thou aught with me ?
here 's my son , sir , a poor boy , — not a poor boy , sir , but the rich propn 's man ; that would , sir , as my father shall specify , — he hath a great infection , sir , as one would say , to serve , — indeed , the short and the long is , i serve the propn , and have a desire , as my father shall specify , — his master and he ( saving your worship 's reverence ) are scarce cater - propn to be brief , the very truth is , that the propn having done me wrong , doth cause me , as my father , being i hope an old man , shall frutify unto you , — i have here a dish of doves , that i would bestow upon your worship ; and my suit is , — in very brief , the suit is impertinent to myself , as your worship shall know by this honest old man ; and , though i say it , though old man , yet , poor man , my father .
one speak for both : — what would you ?
that is the very defect of the matter , sir .
the old proverb is very well parted between my master propn and you , sir ; you have the grace of propn , sir , and he hath enough .
thou speak'st it well .
if any man in propn have a fairer table , which doth offer to swear upon a book , i shall have good fortune !
here 's a small trifle of wives : alas , fifteen wives is nothing ; aleven widows and nine maids , is a simple coming - in for one man : and then , to ' scape drowning thrice ; and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather bed ; here are simple ' scapes !
well , if fortune be a woman , she 's a good wench for this gear .— propn , come .
i 'll take my leave of the propn in the twinkling of an eye .
my best endeavours shall be done herein .
where 's your master ?
yonder , sir , he walks .
propn propn propn !
i have a suit to you .
you have obtain 'd it .
propn propn , hear me : if i do not put on a sober habit , talk with respect , and swear but now and then , wear prayer - books in my pocket , look demurely ; nay more , while grace is saying , hood mine eyes thus with my hat , and sigh , and say amen ; use all the observance of civility , like one well studied in a sad ostent to please his grandam , — never trust me more .
well , we shall see your bearing .
nay , but i bar to - night ; you shall not gage me by what we do to - night .
no , that were pity ; i would entreat you rather to put on your boldest suit of mirth , for we have friends that purpose merriment .
but fare you well , i have some business .
and i must to propn and the rest ; but we will visit you at supper - time .
i am sorry thou wilt leave my father so ; our house is hell , and thou , a merry devil , propn rob it of some taste of tediousness : but fare thee well : there is a ducat for thee .
adieu ! —tears exhibit my tongue .
most beautiful pagan , — most sweet propn !
if a propn did not play the knave and get thee , i am much deceived .
but , adieu !
these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit : adieu !
propn , good launcelot .
propn , what heinous sin is it in me , to be asham 'd to be my father 's child !
if thou keep promise , i shall end this strife ; become a propn , and thy loving wife .
nay , we will slink away in supper - time , disguise us at my lodging , and return , all in an hour .
we have not made good preparation .
we have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
propn vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , and better , in my mind , not undertook .
an it shall please you to break up this , it shall seem to signify .
i know the hand : in faith , ' tis a fair hand ; and whiter than the paper it writ on , is the fair hand that writ .
love - news , in faith .
by your leave , sir .
whither goest thou ?
marry , sir , to bid my old master the propn to sup to - night with my new master the propn .
i am provided of a torch - bearer .
ay , marry , i 'll be gone about it straight .
and so will i .
meet me and propn , at propn 's lodging some hour hence .
propn good we do so .
was not that letter from fair propn ?
i must needs tell thee all .
she hath directed how i shall take her from her father 's house ; what gold and jewels she is furnish 'd with ; what page 's suit she hath in readiness .
if e'er the propn her father come to propn , it will be for his gentle daughter 's sake : and never dare misfortune cross her foot , unless she do it under this excuse , — that she is issue to a faithless propn .
come , go with me ; peruse this as thou goest : fair propn shall be my torchbearer .
quick , quick , i pray thee , draw the curtain straight ; the propn of propn hath ta'en his oath , and comes to his election presently .
behold , there stand the caskets , noble prince ; if you choose that wherein i am contain 'd , straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz 'd ; but if you fail , without more speech , my lord , you must be gone from hence immediately .
i am enjoin 'd by oath to observe three things : first , never to unfold to any one , which casket ' twas i chose ; next , if i fail of the right casket , never in my life to woo a maid in way of marriage ; lastly , if i do fail in fortune of my choice , immediately to leave you , and be gone .
to these injunctions every one doth swear , that comes to hazard for my worthless self .
what says the golden chest ?
ha !
let me see : who chooseth me , shall gain what many men desire .
what many men desire .— that many may be meant by the fool multitude , that choose by show , not learning more than the fond eye doth teach ; which pries not to th ' interior , but , like the martlet , propn in the weather on the outward wall , even in the force and road of casualty .
i will not choose what many men desire , because i will not jump with common spirits , and rank me with the barbarous multitudes .
and that clear honour were purchas 'd by the merit of the wearer !
well , but to my choice : who chooseth me , shall get as much as he deserves .
i will assume desert : — give me a key for this , and instantly unlock my fortunes here .
too long a pause for that which you find there .
what 's here ?
the portrait of a blinking idiot , presenting me a schedule !
i will read it .
how much unlike art thou to propn !
is that my prize ?
are my deserts no better ?
to offend , and judge , are distinct offices , and of opposed natures .
what is here ?
sweet , adieu !
i 'll keep my oath , patiently to bear my wroth .
thus hath the candle sing 'd the moth .
o these deliberate fools !
when they do choose , they have the wisdom by their wit to lose .
where is my lady ?
here ; what would my lord ?
no more , i pray thee ; i am half afeard , thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee , propn spend'st such high - day wit in praising him .
come , come , propn ; for i long to see propn propn 's post that comes so mannerly .
propn , propn propn , if thy will it be .
well , thou shalt see , thy eyes shall be thy judge , the difference of old propn and bassanio : — what , propn shalt not gormandise , as thou hast done with me ; — what , propn and sleep , and snore , and rend apparel out ; — why , propn , i say !
why , propn !
who bids thee call ?
i do not bid thee call .
your worship was wo nt to tell me , i could do nothing without bidding .
call you ?
what is your will ?
i am not bid for love ; they flatter me : but yet i 'll go in hate , to feed upon the prodigal propn .— propn , my girl , look to my house .— i am right loath to go ; there is some ill a - brewing towards my rest , for i did dream of money - bags to - night .
i beseech you , sir , go ; my young master doth expect your reproach .
so do i , his .
and they have conspired together , — i will not say , you shall see a masque ; but if you do , then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a - bleeding on propn propn last , at six o'clock i ' the morning , falling out that year on propn - propn was four year in the afternoon .
what !
are there masques ?
hear you me , propn : lock up my doors ; and when you hear the drum , and the vile squealing of the wry - neck 'd fife , propn not you up to the casements then , nor thrust your head into the public street , to gaze on christian fools with varnish 'd faces : but stop my house 's ears , i mean my casements ; let not the sound of shallow foppery enter my sober house .— by propn 's staff i swear , i have no mind of feasting forth to - night : but i will go .— go you before me , sirrah ; say , i will come .
what says that fool of propn 's offspring ; ha ?
his words were , propn mistress ; nothing else .
farewell ; and if my fortune be not cross 'd , i have a father , you a daughter , lost .
this is the pent - house , under which propn desir 'd us to make stand .
his hour is almost past .
and it is marvel he out - dwells his hour , for lovers ever run before the clock .
that ever holds : who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down ?
where is the horse that doth untread again , his tedious measures with the unbated fire , that he did pace them first ?
all things that are , are with more spirit chased than enjoy 'd .
how like a younger , or a prodigal , the scarfed bark puts from her native bay , hugg 'd and embraced by the strumpet wind !
how like a prodigal doth she return ; with over - weather 'd ribs , and ragged sails , lean , rent , and beggar 'd by the strumpet wind !
here comes propn ; — more of this hereafter .
sweet friends , your patience for my long abode : not i , but my affairs , have made you wait : when you shall please to play the thieves for wives , i 'll watch as long for you then .— approach ; here dwells my father propn .— propn !
who 's within ?
who are you ?
tell me , for more certainty , propn i 'll swear that i do know your tongue .
lorenzo , and thy love .
lorenzo , certain ; and my love , indeed ; for who love i so much ?
and now , who knows but you , propn , whether i am yours ?
propn , and thy thoughts , are witness that thou art .
here , catch this casket ; it is worth the pains .
i am glad ' tis night , you do not look on me , for i am much asham 'd of my exchange : but love is blind , and lovers can not see the pretty follies that themselves commit ; for if they could , propn himself would blush , to see me thus transformed to a boy .
descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
they in themselves , good - sooth , are too - too light .
why , ' tis an office of discovery , love ; and i should be obscur 'd .
so are you , sweet , even in the lovely garnish of a boy .
but come at once ; for the close night doth play the run - away , and we are stay 'd for at propn 's feast .
i will make fast the doors , and gild myself with some more ducats , and be with you straight .
now , by my hood , a propn and no propn .
beshrew me , but i love her heartily : for she is wise , if i can judge of her ; and fair she is , if that mine eyes be true ; and true she is , as she hath prov 'd herself ; and therefore , like herself , wise , fair , and true , propn she be placed in my constant soul .
who 's there ?
propn propn !
where are all the rest ?
i am glad o n't ; i desire no more delight , than to be under sail and gone to - night .
the one of them contains my picture , prince ; if you choose that , then i am yours withal .
some god direct my judgment !
let me see .
for lead ?
hazard for lead ?
this casket threatens : men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages : a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross ; i 'll then nor give , nor hazard , aught for lead .
what says the silver , with her virgin hue ?
who chooseth me , shall get as much as he deserves .
what if i strayed no further , but chose propn let 's see once more this saying grav 'd in gold : who chooseth me , shall gain what many men desire .
one of these three contains her heavenly picture .
is't like that lead contains her ?
twere damnation to think so base a thought : it were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave .
or shall i think in silver she 's immur 'd , being ten times undervalued to tried gold ?
o sinful thought !
never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold .
there , take it , prince , and if my form lie there , then i am yours .
he unlocks the golden casket ] [ he unlocks the golden casket ] o hell !
what have we here ?
a carrion propn , within whose empty eye there is a written scroll ?
i 'll read the writing .
all that glisters is not gold , often have you heard that told : many a man his life hath sold , but my outside to behold : gilded tombs do worms enfold .
why , man , i saw propn under sail ; with him is propn gone along ; and in their ship , i am sure , propn is not .
the law !
my ducats , and my daughter !
a sealed bag , two sealed bags of ducats , of double ducats , stol'n from me by my daughter !
find the girl !
you were best to tell propn what you hear ; yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
a kinder gentleman treads not the earth .
i saw propn and propn part : propn told him , he would make some speed of his return ; he answer 'd — do not so , propn not business for my sake , propn , but stay the very riping of the time ; and for the propn 's bond , which he hath of me , let it not enter in your mind of love : be merry ; and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship , and such fair ostents of love , as shall conveniently become you there : and even there , his eye being big with tears , turning his face , he put his hand behind him , and , with affection wondrous sensible , he wrung propn 's hand , and so they parted .
i think he only loves the world for him .
i pray thee , let us go and find him out , and quicken his embraced heaviness , with some delight or other .
do we so .
now , what news on the propn ?
why , yet it lives there unchecked that propn hath a ship of rich lading wrack 'd on the narrow seas , — the propn , i think they call the place ; a very dangerous flat , and fatal , where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried , as they say , if my gossip report , be an honest woman of her word .
i would she were as lying a gossip in that , as ever knapped ginger , or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband .
but it is true , — without any slips of prolixity , or crossing the plain highway of talk , — that the good propn , the honest antonio , — o that i had a title good enough to keep his name company ! — come , the full stop .
i would it might prove the end of his losses !
what news among the merchants ?
you knew , none so well , none so well as you , of my daughter 's flight .
and propn , for his own part , knew the bird was fledged ; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam .
she is damn 'd for it .
that 's certain , if the devil may be her judge .
my own flesh and blood to rebel !
out upon it , old carrion !
rebels it at these years ?
i say , my daughter is my flesh and blood .
to bait fish withal : if it will feed nothing else , it will feed my revenge .
if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
if you poison us , do we not die ?
and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?
if we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .
if a propn wrong a propn , what is his humility ?
revenge .
if a propn wrong a propn , what should his sufferance be by christian example ?
why , revenge .
the villany you teach me i will execute ; and it shall go hard but i will better the instruction .
gentlemen , my master propn is at his house , and desires to speak with you both .
we have been up and down to seek him .
here comes another of the tribe ; a third can not be matched , unless the devil himself turn propn .
hast thou found my daughter ?
i often came where i did hear of her , but can not find her .
why , there , there , there , there !
a diamond gone , cost me two thousand ducats in propn !
would she were hearsed at my foot , and the ducats in her coffin !
why , thou loss upon loss !
the thief gone with so much , and so much to find the thief ; and no satisfaction , no revenge : nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o ' my shoulders ; no sighs but o ' my breathing : no tears but o ' my shedding .
yes , other men have ill luck too .
antonio , as i heard in propn what , what , what ?
ill luck , ill luck ?
propn an argosy cast away , coming from propn .
is it true ?
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack .
ha ! —where ?
in propn ?
your daughter spent in propn , as i heard , one night , fourscore ducats !
fourscore ducats !
there came divers of propn 's creditors in my company to propn , that swear he can not choose but break .
i am very glad of it : i 'll plague him ; i 'll torture him ; i am glad of it .
one of them showed me a ring , that he had of your daughter for a monkey .
out upon her !
thou torturest me , propn : it was my turquoise : i had it of propn , when i was a bachelor : i would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys .
but propn is certainly undone .
nay , that 's true , that 's very true .
go , propn , fee me an officer , bespeak him a fortnight before : i will have the heart of him , if he forfeit ; forwere he out of propn , i can make what merchandise i will .
go , propn , and meet me at our synagogue ; go , good propn ; at our synagogue , propn .
i could teach you how to choose right , but then i am forsworn ; so will i never be : so may you miss me ; but if you do , you 'll make me wish a sin , that i had been forsworn .
beshrew your eyes , they have o'erlook 'd me , and divided me ; one half of me is yours , the other half propn mine own , i would say ; but if mine , then yours , and so , all yours : o !
let me choose ; for , as i am , i live upon the rack .
upon the rack , propn ?
then confess what treason there is mingled with your love .
none , but that ugly treason of mistrust , which makes me fear the enjoying of my love : there may as well be amity and life ' tween snow and fire , as treason and my love .
ay , but i fear you speak upon the rack , where men enforced do speak anything .
well , then , confess , and live .
confess , and love , had been the very sum of my confession : o happy torment , when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance !
but let me to my fortune and the caskets .
he may win ; and what is music then ?
then music is even as the flourish , when true subjects bow to a new - crowned monarch : such it is , as are those dulcet sounds in break of day , that creep into the dreaming bridegroom 's ear , and summon him to marriage .
now he goes , with no less presence , but with much more love , than young propn , when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling propn to the sea - monster : i stand for sacrifice , the rest aloof are the dardanian wives , with bleared visages , come forth to view the issue of the exploit .
go , propn !
tell me where is fancy bred , or in the heart , or in the head ?
how begot , how nourished ?
propn , dong , bell .
so may the outward shows be least themselves ; the world is still deceiv 'd with ornament .
in law , what plea so tainted and corrupt , but , being season 'd with a gracious voice , obscures the show of evil ?
in religion , what damned error , but some sober brow will bless it , and approve it with a text , hiding the grossness with fair ornament ?
there is no vice so simple , but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts .
thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea ; the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty ; in a word , the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest .
how all the other passions fleet to air , as , doubtful thoughts , and rash - embrac 'd despair , and shudd'ring fear , and green - eyed jealousy .
o love , be moderate .
what find i here ?
propn propn 's counterfeit ?
what demi - god propn come so near creation ?
move these eyes ?
here in her hairs , the painter plays the spider ; and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men , faster than gnats in cobwebs : but her propn how could he see to do them ?
you that choose not by the view , propn as fair , and choose as true !
since this fortune falls to you , be content , and seek no new .
if you be well pleas 'd with this , and hold your fortune for your bliss , turn you where your lady is , and claim her with a loving kiss .
a gentle scroll .— fair lady , by your leave : i come by note , to give and to receive .
like one of two contending in a prize , that thinks he hath done well in people 's eyes , hearing applause and universal shout , propn in spirit , still gazing in a doubt whether those peals of praise be his or no ; so , thrice fair lady , stand i , even so ; as doubtful whether what i see be true , until confirm 'd , sign 'd , ratified by you .
propn , you have bereft me of all words ; only my blood speaks to you in my veins , and there is such confusion in my powers , as , after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince , there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude ; where every something , being blent together , turns to a wild of nothing , save of joy , propn and not express 'd .
but when this ring propn from this finger , then parts life from hence ; o , then be bold to say , propn 's dead .
my lord and lady , it is now our time , that have stood by , and seen our wishes prosper , to cry , good joy ; good joy , my lord and lady !
my lord propn , and my gentle lady , i wish you all the joy that you can wish ; for i am sure you can wish none from me : and , when your honours mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith , i do beseech you , even at that time i may be married too .
with all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
i thank your lordship , you have got me one .
your fortune stood upon the caskets there , and so did mine too , as the matter falls : for wooing here , until i sweat again , and swearing until my very roof was dry with oaths of love , at last , — if promise propn i got a promise of this fair one here , to have her love , provided that your fortune achiev 'd her mistress .
is this true , propn ?
propn , it is , so you stand pleas 'd withal .
and do you , propn , mean good faith ?
yes faith , my lord .
our feast shall be much honour 'd in your marriage .
we 'll play with them , the first boy for a thousand ducats .
no ; we shall ne'er win at that sport , and stake down .
but who comes here ?
lorenzo and his infidel ?
what , and my old venetian friend , propn ?
so do i , my lord .
they are entirely welcome .
i thank your honour .— for my part , my lord , my purpose was not to have seen you here ; but meeting with propn by the way , he did entreat me , past all saying nay , to come with him along .
i did , my lord , and i have reason for it .
propn propn commends him to you .
propn i ope his letter , i pray you tell me how my good friend doth .
not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind ; nor well , unless in mind : his letter there will show you his estate .
propn , cheer yon stranger ; bid her welcome .
your hand , propn .
what 's the news from propn ?
how doth that royal merchant , good antonio ?
i know he will be glad of our success ; we are the propn , we have won the fleece .
i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost !
there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper , that steals the colour from propn 's cheek ; some dear friend dead ; else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man .
when i told you my state was nothing , i should then have told you that i was worse than nothing ; for , indeed , i have engag 'd myself to a dear friend , engag 'd my friend to his mere enemy , to feed my means .
here is a letter , lady ; the paper as the body of my friend , and every word in it a gaping wound , issuing life - blood .
but is it true , propn ?
have all his ventures fail 'd ?
what , not one hit ?
from propn , from propn , and propn , from propn , propn , and propn ?
and not one vessel ' scape the dreadful touch of merchant - marring rocks ?
not one , my lord .
besides , it should appear , that if he had the present money to discharge the propn , he would not take it .
when i was with him , i have heard him swear to propn , and to propn , his countrymen , that he would rather have propn 's flesh , than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him ; and i know , my lord , if law , authority , and power deny not , it will go hard with poor propn .
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble ?
the dearest friend to me , the kindest man , the best - condition 'd and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies ; and one in whom the ancient roman honour more appears , than any that draws breath in propn .
what sum owes he the propn ?
for me , three thousand ducats .
what , no more ?
pay him six thousand , and deface the bond ; double six thousand , and then treble that , before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through propn 's fault .
first go with me to church , and call me wife , and then away to propn to your friend ; for never shall you lie by propn 's side with an unquiet soul .
but let me hear the letter of your friend .
reads ] propn propn , my ships have all propn ] miscarried , my creditors grow cruel , my estate is very low , my bond to the propn is forfeit ; and since , in paying it , it is impossible i should live , all debts are cleared between you and i , if i might but see you at my death ; notwithstanding , use your pleasure : if your love do not persuade you to come , let not my letter .
since i have your good leave to go away , i will make haste : but , till i come again , no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay , nor rest be interposer ' twixt us twain .
propn , look to him .
tell not me of propn this is the fool that lent out money gratis ; — propn , look to him .
hear me yet , good propn .
i pray thee , hear me speak .
i 'll not be made a soft and dull - ey 'd fool , to shake the head , relent , and sigh , and yield to christian intercessors .
follow not ; i 'll have no speaking ; i will have my bond .
it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men .
let him alone ; i 'll follow him no more with bootless prayers .
i am sure , the propn will never grant this forfeiture to hold .
the propn can not deny the course of law , for the commodity that strangers have with us in propn ; if it be denied , ' twill much impeach the justice of the state ; since that the trade and profit of the city propn of all nations .
therefore , go these griefs and losses have so ' bated me , that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh to - morrow , to my bloody creditor .
well , gaoler , on : — pray propn , propn come to see me pay his debt , and then i care not !
propn , although i speak it in your presence , you have a noble and a true conceit of god - like amity ; which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord .
but , if you knew to whom you show this honour , how true a gentleman you send relief , how dear a lover of my lord your husband , i know you would be prouder of the work , than customary bounty can enforce you .
i never did repent for doing good , nor shall not now ; for in companions that do converse and waste the time together , whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love , there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments , of manners , and of spirit ; which makes me think , that this propn , being the bosom lover of my lord , must needs be like my lord .
if it be so , how little is the cost i have bestow 'd , in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty !
this comes too near the praising of myself , therefore , no more of it : hear other things .
i do desire you not to deny this imposition , the which my love , and some necessity , now lays upon you .
propn , with all my heart , i shall obey you in all fair commands .
my people do already know my mind , and will acknowledge you and propn , in place of propn propn and myself .
so fare you well , till we shall meet again .
fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you !
i wish your ladyship all heart 's content .
propn , i go with all convenient speed .
come on , propn ; i have work in hand , that you yet know not of ; we 'll see our husbands before they think of us .
shall they see us ?
they shall , propn ; but in such a habit , that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack .
why , shall we turn to men ?
but come , i 'll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach , which stays for us at the park gate ; and therefore haste away , for we must measure twenty miles to - day .
yes , truly ; — for , look you , the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children ; therefore , i promise you i fear you .
i was always plain with you , and so now i speak my agitation of the matter : therefore , be of good chee ; for , truly , i think you are damned .
there is but one hope in it that can do you any good ; and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither .
and what hope is that , i pray thee ?
marry , you may partly hope that your father got you not , that you are not the propn 's daughter .
that were a kind of bastard hope , indeed ; so , the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother : thus when i shun propn , your father , i fall into propn , your mother : well , you are gone both ways .
i shall be saved by my husband ; he hath made me a propn .
i 'll tell my husband , launcelot , what you say ; here he comes .
i shall grow jealous of you shortly , launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
i shall answer that better to the commonwealth , than you can the getting up of the negro 's belly ; the propn is with child by you , launcelot .
it is much , that the propn should be more than reason : but if she be less than an honest woman , she is , indeed more than i took her for .
how every fool can play upon the word !
that is done , sir ; they have all stomachs .
goodly propn , what a wit - snapper are you !
then bid them prepare dinner .
that is done too , sir : only , cover is the word .
will you cover , then , sir ?
not so , sir , neither ; i know my duty .
yet more quarrelling with occasion !
propn thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant ?
i pray thee , understand a plain man in his plain meaning ; go to thy fellows ; bid them cover the table , serve in the meat , and we will come in to dinner .
for the table , sir , it shall be served in ; for the meat , sir , it shall be covered ; for your coming into dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
o dear discretion , how his words are suited !
the fool hath planted in his memory an army of good words ; and i do know a many fools , that stand in better place , garnish 'd like him , that for a tricksy word propn the matter .
how cheer'st thou , propn ?
and now , good sweet , say thy opinion ; — how dost thou like the propn propn 's wife ?
past all expressing .
it is very meet , the propn propn live an upright life ; for , having such a blessing in his lady , he finds the joys of propn here on earth ; and , if on earth he do not mean it , then in reason he should never come to propn .
why , if two gods should play some heavenly match , and on the wager lay two earthly women , and propn one , there must be something else propn with the other ; for the poor rude world propn not her fellow .
even such a husband propn thou of me , as she is for a wife .
nay , but ask my opinion too of that .
i will anon ; first , let us go to dinner .
nay , let me praise you , while i have a stomach .
no , pray thee , let it serve for table - talk ; then , howso'er thou speak'st , ' mong other things i shall digest it .
well , i 'll set you forth .
what , is propn here ?
ready , so please your grace .
i am sorry for thee ; thou art come to answer a stony adversary , an inhuman wretch propn of pity , void and empty from any dram of mercy .
i have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify his rigorous course ; but since he stands obdurate , and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy 's reach , i do oppose my patience to his fury ; and am arm 'd to suffer , with a quietness of spirit , the very tyranny and rage of his .
go one , and call the propn into the court .
he is ready at the door : he comes , my lord .
make room , and let him stand before our face .
propn , the world thinks , and i think so too , that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice to the last hour of act ; and then , ' tis thought thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse , more strange than is thy strange apparent cruelty : and where thou now exact'st the penalty , ( which is a pound of this poor merchant 's flesh , ) thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture , but , touch 'd with human gentleness and love , forgive a moiety of the principal ; glancing an eye of pity on his losses , that have of late so huddled on his back , propn to press a royal merchant down , and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms , and rough hearts of flint , from stubborn propn and propn , never train 'd to offices of tender courtesy .
we all expect a gentle answer , propn .
you 'll ask me , why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh , than to receive three thousand ducats : i 'll not answer that : but , say , it is my humour .
what , if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleas 'd to give ten thousand ducats to have it ban 'd ?
what , are you answer 'd yet ?
some men there are love not a gaping pig ; some , that are mad if they behold a cat ; and others , when the bagpipe sings i ' the nose , can not contain their urine : for affection , propn of passion , sways it to the mood of what it likes , or loathes .
are you answer 'd ?
this is no answer , thou unfeeling man , to excuse the current of thy cruelty .
i am not bound to please thee with my answers .
do all men kill the things they do not love ?
hates any man the thing he would not kill ?
every offence is not a hate at first .
for thy three thousand ducats here is six .
if every ducat in six thousand ducats were in six parts , and every part a ducat , i would not draw them , — i would have my bond .
how shalt thou hope for mercy , rendering none ?
what judgment shall i dread , doing no wrong ?
let their beds be made as soft as yours , and let their palates be season 'd with such viands ?
upon my power , i may dismiss this court , unless propn , a learned doctor , whom i have sent for to determine this , come here to - day .
my lord , here stays without , a messenger with letters from the doctor , propn come from propn .
good cheer , propn !
the propn shall have my flesh , blood , bones , and all , propn thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood .
came you , from propn , from propn ?
why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly ?
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .
not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh propn , propn mak'st thy knife keen ; but no metal can , no , not the hangman 's axe , bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy .
can no prayers pierce thee ?
no , none that thou hast wit enough to make .
o , be thou damn 'd , inexecrable dog !
and for thy life let justice be accus 'd .
thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith , to hold opinion with propn , that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men : thy currish spirit propn a wolf , who , hang 'd for human slaughter , even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet , and , whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow 'd dam , propn itself in thee ; for thy desires are wolvish , bloody , sterved , and ravenous .
he attendeth here hard by , to know your answer , whether you 'll admit him .
i beseech you , let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation ; for i never knew so young a body with so old a head .
come you from old propn ?
i did , my lord .
you are welcome : take your place .
are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court ?
i am informed thoroughly of the cause .
which is the merchant here , and which the propn ?
antonio and old propn , both stand forth .
is your name propn ?
propn is my name .
ay , so he says .
do you confess the bond ?
i do .
then must the propn be merciful .
on what compulsion must i ?
tell me that .
therefore , propn , propn justice be thy plea , consider this— that in the course of justice , none of us should see salvation : we do pray for mercy ; and that same prayer , doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy .
i have spoke thus much , to mitigate the justice of thy plea , which if thou follow , this strict court of propn must needs give sentence ' gainst the merchant there .
my deeds upon my head !
i crave the law , the penalty and forfeit of my bond .
is he not able to discharge the money ?
yes , here i tender it for him in the court ; propn , twice the sum : if that will not suffice , i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er , on forfeit of my hands , my head , my heart : if this will not suffice , it must appear that malice bears down truth .
and i beseech you , propn once the law to your authority : to do a great right , do a little wrong ; and curb this cruel devil of his will .
a propn come to judgment !
yea , a propn !
o wise young judge , how i do honour thee !
i pray you , let me look upon the bond .
here , ' tis , most reverend doctor , here it is .
shylock , there 's thrice thy money offer 'd thee .
no , not for propn .
when it is paid according to the tenor .
most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment .
why then , thus it is : you must prepare your bosom for his knife .
o noble judge !
o excellent young man !
how much more elder art thou than thy looks !
therefore lay bare your bosom .
it is so .
are there balance here to weigh the flesh ?
i have them ready .
have by some surgeon , propn , on your charge , to stop his wounds , lest he do bleed to death .
is it so nominated in the bond ?
it is not so express 'd , but what of that ?
twere good you do so much for charity .
i can not find it ; ' tis not in the bond .
come , merchant , have you any thing to say ?
propn not that i am fallen to this for you ; for herein propn shows herself more kind than is her custom : it is still her use , to let the wretched man out - live his wealth , to view with hollow eye , and wrinkled brow , an age of poverty ; from which lingering penance of such misery doth she cut me off .
commend me to your honourable wife : tell her the process of propn 's end , say , how i lov 'd you , speak me fair in death ; and , when the tale is told , bid her be judge whether propn had not once a love .
repent not you that you shall lose your friend , and he repents not that he pays your debt ; for , if the propn do cut but deep enough , i 'll pay it instantly with all my heart .
antonio , i am married to a wife , which is as dear to me as life itself ; but life itself , my wife , and all the world are not with me esteem 'd above thy life ; i would lose all , ay , sacrifice them all here to this devil , to deliver you .
your wife would give you little thanks for that , if she were by , to hear you make the offer .
i have a wife , whom i protest i love ; i would she were in propn , so she could entreat some power to change this currish propn .
propn well you offer it behind her back ; the wish would make else an unquiet house .
we trifle time ; i pray thee pursue sentence .
most rightful judge !
come , prepare !
is that the law ?
thyself shalt see the act : for , as thou urgest justice , be assur 'd propn shalt have justice , more than thou desirest .
i take this offer then , — pay the bond thrice and let the propn go .
here is the money .
o propn !
an upright judge , a learned judge !
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
shed thou no blood ; nor cut thou less , nor more , but just a pound of flesh : if thou tak'st more , or less , than a just pound , — be it but so much as makes it light , or heavy , in the substance , or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple , — nay , if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair , — propn diest and all thy goods are confiscate .
a second propn , a propn , propn !
now , infidel , i have thee on the hip .
why doth the propn pause ?
take thy forfeiture .
give me my principal , and let me go .
i have it ready for thee ; here it is .
he hath refus 'd it in the open court ; he shall have merely justice and his bond .
shall i not have barely my principal ?
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture , to be so taken at thy peril , propn .
why , then the devil give him good of it !
i 'll stay no longer question .
it is enacted in the laws of venice , — if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen , the party ' gainst the which he doth contrive , shall seize one half his goods ; the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state ; and the offender 's life lies in the mercy of the duke only , ' gainst all other voice .
in which predicament , i say , thou stand'st : for it appears by manifest proceeding , that , indirectly , and directly too , propn hast contriv 'd against the very life of the defendant ; and thou hast incurr 'd the danger formerly by me rehears 'd .
down , therefore , and beg mercy of the duke .
beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself : and yet , thy wealth being forfeit to the state , propn hast not left the value of a cord ; therefore thou must be hang 'd at the state 's charge .
ay , for the state ; not for propn .
nay , take my life and all ; pardon not that : you take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house ; you take my life , when you do take the means whereby i live .
what mercy can you render him , propn ?
a halter gratis ; nothing else , for propn 's sake !
so please my lord the duke , and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods ; i am content , so he will let me have the other half in use , to render it , upon his death , unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter ; two things provided more , — that for this favour , he presently become a propn ; the other , that he do record a gift , here in the court , of all he dies possess 'd , unto his son propn and his daughter .
he shall do this ; or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronounced here .
art thou contented , propn ?
what dost thou say ?
i am content .
clerk , draw a deed of gift .
i pray you give me leave to go from hence : i am not well ; send the deed after me , and i will sign it .
get thee gone , but do it .
in christening , shalt thou have two god - fathers ; had i been judge , thou shouldst have had ten more , to bring thee to the gallows , not the font .
propn , i entreat you home with me to dinner .
i am sorry that your leisure serves you not .
antonio , gratify this gentleman , for , in my mind , you are much bound to him .
most worthy gentleman , i , and my friend , have by your wisdom been this day acquitted of grievous penalties ; in lieu whereof , three thousand ducats , due unto the propn , we freely cope your courteous pains withal .
and stand indebted , over and above , in love and service to you evermore .
he is well paid that is well satisfied : and i , delivering you , am satisfied , and therein do account myself well paid ; my mind was never yet more mercenary .
i pray you , know me , when we meet again ; i wish you well , and so i take my leave .
you press me far , and therefore i will yield .
i will have nothing else but only this ; and now , methinks , i have a mind to it .
there 's more depends on this than on the value .
the dearest ring in propn will i give you , and find it out by proclamation ; only for this i pray you pardon me .
i see , sir , you are liberal in offers : you taught me first to beg ; and now , methinks , you teach me how a beggar should be answer 'd .
good sir , this ring was given me by my wife ; and , when she put it on , she made me vow that i should neither sell , nor give , nor lose it .
that ' scuse serves many men to save their gifts .
an if your wife be not a mad woman , and know how well i have deserv 'd the ring , she would not hold out enemy for ever , for giving it to me .
well , peace be with you !
my propn propn , let him have the ring , let his deservings , and my love withal , be valued ' gainst your wife 's commandment .
go , propn , run and overtake him ; give him the ring ; and bring him , if thou canst , unto propn 's house : — away !
inquire the propn 's house out , give him this deed , and let him sign it ; we 'll away to - night , and be a day before our husbands home .
this deed will be well welcome to propn .
fair sir , you are well propn : my propn propn , upon more advice , propn sent you here this ring , and doth entreat your company at dinner .
that can not be : his ring i do accept most thankfully , and so , i pray you , tell him : furthermore , i pray you , show my youth old propn 's house .
that will i do .
thou may'st , i warrant we shall have old swearing , that they did give the rings away to men ; but we 'll outface them , and outswear them too .
away !
make haste ; thou know'st where i will tarry .
come , good sir , will you show me to this house ?
the moon shines bright : — in such a night as this , when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees , and they did make no noise , — in such a night , propn , methinks , mounted the propn walls , and sigh 'd his soul toward the grecian tents , where propn lay that night .
in such a night , did propn fearfully o'ertrip the dew , and saw the lion 's shadow ere himself , and ran dismay 'd away .
in such a night , propn propn , with a willow in her hand , upon the wild sea - banks , and waft her love to come again to propn .
in such a night , propn gather 'd the enchanted herbs that did renew old propn .
in such a night , did propn steal from the wealthy propn , and with an unthrift love did run from propn , as far as propn .
in such a night , did young propn swear he lov 'd her well ; stealing her soul with many vows of faith , and ne'er a true one .
in such a night , did pretty propn , like a little shrew , slander her love , and he forgave it her .
i would out - night you , did no body come ; but , hark , i hear the footing of a man .
who comes so fast in silence of the night ?
a friend .
a friend ?
what friend ?
your name , i pray you , friend ?
propn is my name ; and i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at propn ; she doth stray about by holy crosses , where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours .
who comes with her ?
none , but a holy hermit , and her maid .
i pray you , is my master yet return 'd ?
sola , sola !
wo ha , ho !
sola , sola !
who calls ?
sola !
sola , sola !
sola !
where ?
where ?
here .
tell him there 's a post come from my master , with his horn full of good news ; my master will be here ere morning .
my friend propn , signify , i pray you , within the house , your mistress is at hand : and bring your music forth into the air .
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
here will we sit , and let the sounds of music propn in our ears ; soft stillness , and the night , become the touches of sweet harmony .
and wake propn with a hymn ; with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ' ear , and draw her home with music .
i am never merry when i hear sweet music .
the man that hath no music in himself , nor is not mov 'd with concord of sweet sounds , is fit for treasons , stratagems , and spoils ; the motions of his spirit are dull as night , and his affections dark as propn : let no such man be trusted .— mark the music .
so shines a good deed in a naughty world .
when the moon shone , we did not see the candle .
so doth the greater glory dim the less : a substitute shines brightly as a king , unto the king be by ; and then his state , propn itself , as doth an inland brook into the main of waters .
music !
hark !
it is your music , madam , of the house .
nothing is good , i see , without respect ; propn it sounds much sweeter than by day .
silence bestows that virtue on it , madam .
the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark , when neither is attended ; and , i think , the nightingale , if she should sing by day , when every goose is cackling , would be thought no better a musician than the wren .
the moon sleeps with propn , and would not be awak 'd .
that is the voice , or i am much deceiv 'd , of propn .
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo , by the bad voice .
dear lady , welcome home .
we have been praying for our husbands ' welfare , which speed , we hope , the better for our words .
are they return 'd ?
propn , they are not yet ; but there is come a messenger before , to signify their coming .
go in , propn ; give order to my servants , that they take no note at all of our being absent hence ; nor you , propn : — propn , nor you .
we should hold day with the propn , if you would walk in absence of the sun .
i thank you , madam : give welcome to my friend.— this is the man , this is propn , to whom i am so infinitely bound .
no more than i am well acquitted of .
a quarrel , ho , already !
what 's the matter ?
you swore to me , when i did give it you , that you would wear it till your hour of death ; and that it should lie with you in your grave : though not for me , yet for your vehement oaths , you should have been respective , and have kept it .
gave it a judge 's clerk ! —no , propn 's my judge !
the clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it .
he will , an if he live to be a man .
ay , if a woman live to be a man .
now , by this hand , i gave it to a youth , — a kind of boy ; a little scrubbed boy , no higher than thyself , the judge 's clerk ; a prating boy , that begg 'd it as a fee ; i could not for my heart deny it him .
you were to blame , i must be plain with you , to part so slightly with your wife 's first gift ; a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger , and so riveted with faith unto your flesh .
i gave my love a ring , and made him swear never to part with it ; and here he stands , — i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it , nor pluck it from his finger , for the wealth that the world masters .
now , in faith , propn , you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief ; an ' twere to me , i should be mad at it .
why , i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it .
my propn propn gave his ring away unto the judge that begg 'd it , and , indeed , deserv 'd it too ; and then the boy , his clerk , that took some pains in writing , he begg 'd mine : and neither man , nor master , would take aught but the two rings .
what ring gave you my lord ?
not that , i hope , which you receiv 'd of me .
if i could add a lie unto a fault , i would deny it ; but you see , my finger propn not the ring upon it , it is gone .
nor i in yours till i again see mine .
propn propn , if you did know to whom i gave the ring , if you did know for whom i gave the ring , and would conceive for what i gave the ring , and how unwillingly i left the ring , when nought would be accepted but the ring , you would abate the strength of your displeasure .
if you had known the virtue of the ring , or half her worthiness that gave the ring , or your own honour to contain the ring , you would not then have parted with the ring .
what man is there so much unreasonable , if you had pleas 'd to have defended it with any terms of zeal , wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony ?
propn teaches me what to believe ; i 'll die for't , but some woman had the ring .
no , by mine honour , madam , by my soul , no woman had it , but a civil doctor , which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and begg 'd the ring ; the which i did deny him , and suffer 'd him to go displeas 'd away ; even he that had uphold the very life of my dear friend .
what should i say , sweet lady ?
i was enforc 'd to send it after him ; i was beset with shame and courtesy ; my honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it .
pardon me , good lady ; for , by these blessed candles of the night , had you been there , i think , you would have begg 'd the ring of me to give the worthy doctor .
and i his clerk ; therefore be well advis 'd how you do leave me to mine own protection .
well , do you so : let not me take him then , for if i do , i 'll mar the young clerk 's pen .
i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels .
propn , grieve not you ; you are welcome notwithstanding .
propn , forgive me this enforced wrong ; and , in the hearing of these many friends , i swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes , wherein i see myself , — propn you but that !
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself : in each eye , one : — swear by your double self , and there 's an oath of credit .
nay , but hear me : pardon this fault , and by my soul i swear , i never more will break an oath with thee .
then you shall be his surety .
give him this and bid him keep it better than the other .
here , propn propn ; swear to keep this ring .
i had it of him : pardon me , propn : for by this ring the doctor lay with me .
and pardon me , my gentle propn ; for that same scrubbed boy , the doctor 's clerk , in lieu of this last night did lie with me .
are we cuckolds , ere we have deserv 'd it ?
i am dumb .
were you the doctor , and i knew you not ?
were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold ?
ay , but the clerk that never means to do it , unless he live until he be a man .
sweet doctor , you shall be my bedfellow ; when i am absent , then lie with my wife .
sweet lady , you have given me life , and living ; for here i read for certain , that my ships are safely come to road .
how now , propn ?
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you .
fair ladies , you drop manna in the way of starved people .
it is almost morning , and yet , i am sure , you are not satisfied of these events at full .
let us go in ; and charge us there upon inter'gatories , and we will answer all things faithfully .
well , while i live , i 'll fear no other thing so sore , as keeping safe propn 's ring .
now , fair propn , our nuptial hour draws on apace ; four happy days bring in another moon ; but , o , methinks , how slow this old moon wanes !
four days will quickly steep themselves in night ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; and then the moon , like to a silver bow propn - bent in propn , shall behold the night of our solemnities .
go , propn , stir up the athenian youth to merriments ; propn the pert and nimble spirit of mirth ; turn melancholy forth to funerals ; the pale companion is not for our pomp .
propn , i woo 'd thee with my sword , and won thy love doing thee injuries ; but i will we d thee in another key , with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling .
happy be propn , our renowned duke !
and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your propn propn to marry with propn , i beg the ancient privilege of propn : as she is mine , i may dispose of her ; which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death , according to our law immediately provided in that case .
what say you , propn ?
be advis 'd , fair maid .
to you your father should be as a god ; one that composed your beauties ; yea , and one to whom you are but as a form in wax , by him imprinted , and within his power to leave the figure , or disfigure it .
propn is a worthy gentleman .
so is propn .
in himself he is ; but in this kind , wanting your father 's voice , the other must be held the worthier .
i would my father look 'd but with my eyes .
rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
i do entreat your grace to pardon me .
either to die the death , or to abjure for ever the society of men .
therefore , fair propn , question your desires , propn of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father 's choice , you can endure the livery of a nun , for aye to be in shady cloister mew 'd , to live a barren sister all your life , chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon .
propn - blessed they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage ; but earthlier happy is the rose distill 'd than that which , withering on the virgin thorn grows , lives , and dies , in single blessedness .
so will i grow , so live , so die , my lord , propn i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship , whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty .
take time to pause ; and by the next new moon— the sealing - day betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship , — upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father 's will , or else to we d propn , as he would , or on propn 's altar to protest for aye austerity and single life .
propn , sweet propn ; and , propn , yield propn crazed title to my certain right .
scornful lysander !
true , he hath my love ; and what is mine my love shall render him ; and she is mine ; and all my right of her i do estate unto propn .
i am , my lord , as well derived as he , as well possess 'd ; my love is more than his ; my fortunes every way as fairly rank 'd , if not with vantage , as propn ' ; and , which is more than all these boasts can be , i am belov 'd of beauteous propn .
why should not i then prosecute my right ?
propn , i 'll avouch it to his head , made love to propn 's daughter , propn , and won her soul ; and she , sweet lady , dotes , devoutly dotes , dotes in idolatry , upon this spotted and inconstant man .
come , my hippolyta ; what cheer , my love ?
propn and propn , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
with duty and desire we follow you .
how now , my love !
why is your cheek so pale ?
how chance the roses there do fade so fast ?
ay me !
too high to be enthrall 'd to low .
or else misgraffed in respect of years— o spite !
too old to be engag 'd to young .
to choose love by another 's eyes .
a good persuasion ; therefore , hear me , propn .
there , gentle propn , may i marry thee ; and to that place the sharp athenian law can not pursue us .
if thou lovest me then , steal forth thy father 's house tomorrow night ; and in the wood , a league without the town , where i did meet thee once with propn to do observance to a morn of propn , there will i stay for thee .
my good lysander !
i swear to thee , by propn 's strongest bow , by his best arrow , with the golden head , by the simplicity of propn ' doves , by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves , and by that fire which burn 'd the propn propn , when the false propn under sail was seen , by all the vows that ever men have broke , in number more than ever women spoke , in that same place thou hast appointed me , propn truly will i meet with thee .
keep promise , love .
look , here comes propn .
propn speed fair propn !
whither away ?
were the world mine , propn being bated , the rest i 'd give to be to you translated .
o , teach me how you look , and with what art you sway the motion of propn ' heart !
i frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !
i give him curses , yet he gives me love .
o that my prayers could such affection move !
the more i hate , the more he follows me .
the more i love , the more he hateth me .
his folly , propn , is no fault of mine .
take comfort : he no more shall see my face ; propn and myself will fly this place .
before the time i did propn see , seem 'd propn as a paradise to me .
o , then , what graces in my love do dwell , that he hath turn 'd a heaven unto a hell !
keep word , lysander ; we must starve our sight from lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
i will , my propn .
how happy some o'er other some can be !
through propn i am thought as fair as she .
but what of that ?
propn thinks not so ; he will not know what all but he do know .
things base and vile , holding no quantity , propn can transpose to form and dignity .
love looks not with the eyes , but with the mind ; and therefore is wing 'd propn painted blind .
as waggish boys in game themselves forswear , so the boy propn is perjured everywhere ; for ere propn look 'd on propn 's eyne , he hail 'd down oaths that he was only mine ; and when this hail some heat from propn felt , so he dissolv 'd , and showers of oaths did melt .
i will go tell him of fair propn 's flight ; then to the wood will he tomorrow night propn her ; and for this intelligence if i have thanks , it is a dear expense .
but herein mean i to enrich my pain , to have his sight thither and back again .
is all our company here ?
you were best to call them generally , man by man , according to the scrip .
here is the scroll of every man 's name , which is thought fit , through all propn , to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding - day at night .
first , good propn propn , say what the play treats on ; then read the names of the actors ; and so grow to a point .
marry , our play is , the most propn propn and propn propn propn of propn and propn .
masters , spread yourselves .
ready .
name what part i am for , and proceed .
you , propn propn , are set down for propn .
what is propn ?
a lover , or a tyrant ?
a lover , that kills himself most gallant for love .
that will ask some tears in the true performing of it .
if i do it , let the audience look to their eyes ; i will move storms ; i will condole in some measure .
propn propn , the bellows - mender .
here , propn propn .
flute , you must take propn on you .
what is propn ?
a wandering knight ?
it is the lady that propn must love .
nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; i have a beard coming .
that 's all one ; you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
an i may hide my face , let me play propn too .
well , proceed .
propn propn , the tailor .
here , propn propn .
here , propn propn .
have you the lion 's part written ?
pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study .
you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring .
let me play the lion too .
i will roar that i will do any man 's heart good to hear me ; i will roar , that i will make the duke say ‘ let him roar again , let him roar propn an you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were enough to hang us all .
that would hang us , every mother 's son .
you can play no part but propn ; for propn is a sweet - faced man ; a proper man , as one shall see in a summer 's day ; a most lovely gentleman - like man ; therefore you must needs play propn .
well , i will undertake it .
what beard were i best to play it in ?
why , what you will .
i will discharge it in either your straw color beard , your orange - tawny beard , your purple - in - grain beard , or your french crown color beard , your perfect yellow .
some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play barefaced .
in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties , such as our play wants .
i pray you , fail me not .
we will meet ; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
take pains ; be perfect ; adieu .
at the duke 's oak we meet .
enough ; hold , or cut bow - strings .
how now , spirit !
whither wander you ?
over hill , over dale , thorough bush , thorough brier , over park , over pale , thorough flood , thorough fire , i do wander every where , propn than the moon 's sphere ; and i serve the fairy queen , to dew her orbs upon the green .
propn , thou lob of spirits ; i 'll be gone .
our queen and all her elves come here anon .
the king doth keep his revels here tonight ; take heed the queen come not within his sight ; for propn is passing fell and wrath , because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy , stolen from an indian king .
and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , but they do square , that all their elves for fear propn into acorn cups and hide them there .
are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery , propn milk , and sometimes labor in the quern , and bootless make the breathless housewife churn , and sometime make the drink to bear no barm , propn night - wanderers , laughing at their harm ?
those that propn call you , and sweet propn , you do their work , and they shall have good luck .
thou speakest aright : i am that merry wanderer of the night .
i jest to propn , and make him smile , when i a fat and bean - fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip 's bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab , and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , and on her withered dewlap pour the ale .
ill met by moonlight , proud propn .
what , jealous propn !
fairies , skip hence ; i have forsworn his bed and company .
tarry , rash wanton ; am not i thy lord ?
then i must be thy lady ; but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land , and in the shape of propn sat all day , playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous propn .
how canst thou thus , for shame , propn , propn at my credit with propn , knowing i know thy love to propn ?
didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night from propn , whom he ravished ?
and make him with fair propn break his faith , with propn and propn ?
therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck 'd up from the sea contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , propn every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents .
the human mortals want their winter here ; no night is now with hymn or carol blest ; therefore the moon , the governess of floods , propn in her anger , washes all the air , that rheumatic diseases do abound .
and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter : hoary - headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; and on old propn ' thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is , as in mockery , set .
the spring , the summer , the childing autumn , angry winter , change their wonted liveries ; and the mazed world , by their increase , now knows not which is which .
do you amend it , then ; it lies in you .
why should propn cross her propn ?
but she , being mortal , of that boy did die ; and for her sake do i rear up her boy ; and for her sake i will not part with him .
how long within this wood intend you stay ?
perchance till after propn ' wedding - day .
if you will patiently dance in our round , and see our moonlight revels , go with us ; if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts .
give me that boy , and i will go with thee .
not for thy fairy kingdom .
fairies , away .
we shall chide downright if i longer stay .
my gentle propn , come hither .
thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory , and heard a mermaid , on a dolphin 's back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath , that the rude sea grew civil at her song , and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea - maid 's music .
i remember .
yet mark 'd i where the bolt of propn fell .
the juice of it on sleeping eye - lids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees .
fetch me this herb , and be thou here again propn the leviathan can swim a league .
i 'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes .
and ere i take this charm from off her sight , as i can take it with another herb , i 'll make her render up her page to me .
but who comes here ?
i am invisible ; and i will overhear their conference .
i love thee not , therefore pursue me not .
where is propn and fair hermia ?
the one i 'll slay , the other slayeth me .
thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood , and here am i , and wood within this wood , because i can not meet my propn .
hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
leave you your power to draw , and i shall have no power to follow you .
do i entice you ?
do i speak you fair ?
or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i can not love you ?
and even for that do i love you the more .
i am your spaniel ; and , propn , the more you beat me , i will fawn on you .
what worser place can i beg in your love , — and yet a place of high respect with me , — than to be used as you use your dog ?
propn not too much the hatred of my spirit ; for i am sick when i do look on thee .
and i am sick when i look not on you .
you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not ; to trust the opportunity of night , and the ill counsel of a desert place , with the rich worth of your virginity .
your virtue is my privilege .
for that it is not night when i do see your face , therefore i think i am not in the night ; nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , for you , in my respect , are all the world .
then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me ?
i 'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
run when you will ; the story shall be changed : propn flies , and propn holds the chase ; the dove pursues the griffin ; the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger ; bootless speed , when cowardice pursues and valour flies .
ay , in the temple , in the town , the field , you do me mischief .
propn , propn !
i 'll follow thee , and make a heaven of hell , to die upon the hand i love so well .
welcome , wanderer .
ay , there it is .
i pray thee give it me .
thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on .
effect it with some care , that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love .
and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow .
fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so .
come now , a roundel and a fairy song ; then , for the third part of a minute , hence : some to kill cankers in the musk - rose buds ; some war with rere - mice for their leathern wings , to make my small elves coats ; and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits .
sing me now asleep ; then to your offices , and let me rest .
song ] you spotted snakes with double tongue , thorny hedgehogs , be not seen ; propn and blind - worms , do no wrong , come not near our fairy propn .
philomel with melody propn in our sweet lullaby .
lulla , lulla , lullaby ; lulla , lulla , lullaby .
philomel with melody , & amp ; c . hence away ; now all is well .
one aloof stand sentinel .
wake when some vile thing is near .
fair love , you faint with wandering in the wood ; and , to speak troth , i have forgot our way ; we 'll rest us , propn , if you think it good , and tarry for the comfort of the day .
be it so , lysander : find you out a bed , for i upon this bank will rest my head .
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both ; one heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .
o , take the sense , sweet , of my innocence !
love takes the meaning in love 's conference .
then by your side no bed - room me deny , for lying so , propn , i do not lie .
lysander riddles very prettily .
now much beshrew my manners and my pride , if propn meant to say propn lied !
thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end !
amen , amen , to that fair prayer say i ; and then end life when i end loyalty !
through the forest have i gone , but propn found i none , on whose eyes i might approve this flower 's force in stirring love .
pretty soul !
she durst not lie near this lack - love , this kill - courtesy .
so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to propn .
stay , though thou kill me , sweet propn .
i charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
o , wilt thou darkling leave me ?
do not so .
stay on thy peril ; i alone will go .
o , i am out of breath in this fond chase !
the more my prayer , the lesser is my grace .
happy is propn , wheresoe'er she lies , for she hath blessed and attractive eyes .
how came her eyes so bright ?
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with propn 's sphery eyne ?
but who is here ?
on the ground !
i see no blood , no wound .
propn , if you live , good sir , awake .
propn ] and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake .
propn propn !
nature shows art , that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart .
where is propn ?
o , how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword !
do not say so , propn ; say not so .
what though he love your hermia ?
propn , what though ?
content with propn !
the will of man is by his reason sway 'd , and reason says you are the worthier maid .
things growing are not ripe until their season ; so i , being young , till now ripe not to reason ; and touching now the point of human skill , propn becomes the marshal to my will , and leads me to your eyes , where i o'erlook propn 's stories , written in propn 's richest book .
propn was i to this keen mockery born ?
when at your hands did i deserve this scorn ?
is't not enough , is't not enough , young man , that i did never , no , nor never can , deserve a sweet look from propn ' eye , but you must flout my insufficiency ?
good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , in such disdainful manner me to woo .
o , that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused !
lysander , look how i do quake with fear .
what , removed ?
lysander !
lord !
what , out of hearing ?
gone ?
no sound , no word ?
propn , where are you ?
speak , an if you hear ; speak , of all loves !
i swoon almost with fear .
then i well perceive you are not nigh .
either death or you i 'll find immediately .
are we all met ?
propn , pat ; and here 's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal .
this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn - brake our tiring - house ; and we will do it in action , as we will do it before the propn .
propn propn what sayest thou , bully bottom ?
there are things in this comedy of propn and propn that will never please .
first , propn must draw a sword to kill himself ; which the ladies can not abide .
how answer you that ?
by'r lakin , a parlous fear .
i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
this will put them out of fear .
no , make it two more ; let it be written in eight and eight .
will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
i fear it , i promise you .
therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .
nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion 's neck ; and he himself must speak through , saying thus , or to the same defect : — ‘ ladies , ’ —or ‘ fair ladies , — i would wish you ’ —or ‘ i would request you ’ —or ‘ i would entreat you , — not to fear , not to tremble .
my life for yours !
if you think i come hither as a lion , it were pity of my life .
well , it shall be so .
but there is two hard things ; that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber ; for , you know , propn and propn meet by moonlight .
doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?
a calendar , a calendar !
yes , it doth shine that night .
why , then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window , where we play , open ; and the moon may shine in at the casement .
ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern , and say he comes to disfigure , or to present , the person of moonshine .
some man or other must present propn ; and let him have some plaster , or some loam , or some rough - cast about him , to signify wall ; and let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall propn and propn whisper .
if that may be , then all is well .
come , sit down , every mother 's son , and rehearse your parts .
what hempen home - spuns have we swagg'ring here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ?
what , a play toward !
i 'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause .
must i speak now ?
ay , marry , must you ; for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .
you speak all your part at once , cues , and all .
o strange !
we are haunted .
fly , masters !
help !
i 'll follow you ; i 'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; sometime a horse i 'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .
why do they run away ?
this is a knavery of them to make me afeard .
o bottom , thou art changed !
what do i see on thee ?
what do you see ?
you see an ass - head of your own , do you ?
i see their knavery : this is to make an ass of me ; to fright me , if they could .
the ousel cock , so black of hue , with orange - tawny bill , the throstle with his note so true , the wren with little quill .
propn ] what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ?
mine ear is much enamored of thy note ; so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; and thy fair virtue 's force perforce doth move me , on the first view to say , to swear , i love thee .
the more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends .
nay , i can gleek upon occasion .
thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
i am a spirit of no common rate ; the summer still doth tend upon my state ; and i do love thee ; therefore , go with me .
propn !
and propn !
ready .
and i .
and i .
and i .
where shall we go ?
be kind and courteous to this gentleman ; propn in his walks , and gambol in his eyes ; feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; the honey - bags steal from the humble - bees , and for night - tapers crop their waxen thighs , and light them at the fiery glow - worm 's eyes , to have my love to bed and to arise ; and pluck the wings from painted butterflies , to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes .
nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
propn , mortal !
propn !
propn !
propn !
i cry your worships mercy , heartily ; i beseech your worship 's name .
propn .
i shall desire you of more acquaintance , good propn propn .
propn .
propn .
propn propn propn , i know your patience well .
that same cowardly giant - like ox - beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house .
i promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .
i desire your more acquaintance , good propn propn .
come , wait upon him ; lead him to my bower .
the moon , methinks , looks with a watery eye ; and when she weeps , weeps every little flower ; lamenting some enforced chastity .
tie up my love 's tongue , bring him silently .
i wonder if propn be awaked ; then , what it was that next came in her eye , which she must dote on in extremity .
what night - rule now about this haunted grove ?
my mistress with a monster is in love .
near to her close and consecrated bower , while she was in her dull and sleeping hour , a crew of patches , rude mechanicals , that work for bread upon athenian stalls , were met together to rehearse a play , intended for great propn ' nuptial - day .
the shallowest thick - skin of that barren sort , who propn presented , in their sport propn his scene and ent'red in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , an ass 's nole i fixed on his head .
propn his propn must be answered , and forth my mimic comes .
their sense thus weak , lost with their fears thus strong , made senseless things begin to do them wrong , for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; some sleeves , some hats , from yielders all things catch .
this falls out better than i could devise .
but hast thou yet latch 'd the propn 's eyes with the love - juice , as i did bid thee do ?
i took him sleeping , — that is finish 'd too , — and the athenian woman by his side ; that , when he waked , of force she must be eyed .
stand close ; this is the same propn .
this is the woman , but not this the man .
o , why rebuke you him that loves you so ?
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
now i but chide , but i should use thee worse , for thou , i fear , hast given me cause to curse .
if thou hast slain propn in his sleep , being o'er shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , and kill me too .
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me .
would he have stolen away from sleeping propn ?
i 'll believe as soon this whole earth may be bored , and that the moon propn through the centre creep and so displease her brother 's noontide with the propn .
it can not be but thou hast murder 'd him ; so should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
what 's this to my lysander ?
where is he ?
ah , good propn , wilt thou give him me ?
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds .
out , dog !
out , cur !
thou drivest me past the bounds of maiden 's patience .
propn thou slain him , then ?
henceforth be never number 'd among men !
o , once tell true ; tell true , even for my sake !
propn thou have look 'd upon him being awake , and hast thou kill 'd him sleeping ?
o brave touch !
could not a worm , an adder , do so much ?
you spend your passion on a misprised mood : i am not guilty of propn 's blood ; nor is he dead , for aught that i can tell .
i pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
an if i could , what should i get therefore ?
and from thy hated presence part i so ; see me no more , whether he be dead or no .
so sorrow 's heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe ; which now in some slight measure it will pay , if for his tender here i make some stay .
what hast thou done ?
thou hast mistaken quite , and laid the love - juice on some true - love 's sight .
of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turn 'd , and not a false turn 'd true .
then fate o'er - rules , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath .
i go , i go ; look how i go , propn than arrow from the propn 's bow .
flower of this purple dye , hit with propn 's archery , propn in apple of his eye .
captain of our fairy band , propn is here at hand , and the youth , mistook by me propn for a lover 's fee ; propn we their fond pageant see ?
propn , what fools these mortals be !
stand aside .
the noise they make will cause propn to awake .
why should you think that i should woo in scorn ?
scorn and derision never come in tears .
look when i vow , i weep ; and vows so born , in their nativity all truth appears .
how can these things in me seem scorn to you , bearing the badge of faith , to prove them true ?
you do advance your cunning more and more .
when truth kills truth , o devilish - holy fray !
these vows are propn 's .
will you give her o'er ?
i had no judgment when to her i swore .
nor none , in my mind , now you give her o'er .
propn loves her , and he loves not you .
to what , my love , shall i compare thine eyne ?
crystal is muddy .
o , how ripe in show propn lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow !
that pure congealed white , high propn ' snow , propn with the eastern wind , turns to a crow when thou hold'st up thy hand .
o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss !
o spite !
o hell !
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment .
if you were civil and knew courtesy , you would not do me thus much injury .
can you not hate me , as i know you do , but you must join in souls to mock me too ?
if you were men , as men you are in show , you would not use a gentle lady so : to vow , and swear , and superpraise my parts , when i am sure you hate me with your hearts .
you both are rivals , and love propn ; and now both rivals , to mock propn .
a trim exploit , a manly enterprise , to conjure tears up in a poor maid 's eyes with your derision !
none of noble sort would so offend a virgin , and extort a poor soul 's patience , all to make you sport .
you are unkind , propn ; be not so ; for you love propn .
never did mockers waste more idle breath .
propn , keep thy propn ; i will none .
if e'er i loved her , all that love is gone .
my heart to her but as guest - wise so journ 'd , and now to propn is it home return 'd , there to remain .
propn , it is not so .
but why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
why should he stay whom love doth press to go ?
what love could press propn from my side ?
propn 's love , that would not let him bide , propn propn , who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light .
why seek'st thou me ?
could not this make thee know , the hate i bare thee made me leave thee so ?
you speak not as you think ; it can not be .
propn , she is one of this confederacy !
now i perceive they have conjoin 'd all three to fashion this false sport , in spite of me .
propn propn !
most ungrateful maid !
have you conspired , have you with these contrived , to bait me with this foul derision ?
is all the counsel that we two have shared , the sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent , when we have chid the hasty - footed time for parting us , — o , is all forgot ?
all school - days ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
we , propn , like two artificial gods , have with our needles created both one flower , both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , both warbling of one song , both in one key ; as if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , had been incorporate .
and will you rent our ancient love asunder , to join with men in scorning your poor friend ?
have you not set propn , as in scorn , to follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
and made your other love , propn , who even but now did spurn me with his foot , to call me goddess , nymph , divine , and rare , precious , celestial ?
wherefore speaks he this to her he hates ?
and wherefore doth propn deny your love , so rich within his soul , and tender me , forsooth , affection , but by your setting on , by your consent ?
what though i be not so in grace as you , so hung upon with love , so fortunate , but miserable most , to love unloved ?
this you should pity rather than despise .
i understand not what you mean by this .
if you have any pity , grace , or manners , you would not make me such an argument .
stay , gentle propn ; hear my excuse ; my love , my life , my soul , fair propn !
o excellent !
sweet , do not scorn her so .
if she can not entreat , i can compel .
thou canst compel no more than she entreat ; propn threats have no more strength than her weak prayers propn , i love thee , by my life , i do ; i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not .
i say i love thee more than he can do .
if thou say so , withdraw , and prove it too .
away , you propn !
you are a tame man ; go !
why are you grown so rude ?
what change is this , sweet love ?
thy love !
out , tawny propn , out !
out , loathed medicine !
o hated potion , hence !
do you not jest ?
yes , sooth ; and so do you .
propn , i will keep my word with thee .
i would i had your bond ; for i perceive a weak bond holds you ; i 'll not trust your word .
although i hate her , i 'll not harm her so .
what !
can you do me greater harm than hate ?
hate me !
wherefore ?
o me !
what news , my love ?
am not i propn ?
are not you lysander ?
why then , you left me , — o , the gods forbid ! — in earnest , shall i say ?
therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt ; be certain , nothing truer ; ' tis no jest that i do hate thee and love propn .
o me !
you juggler !
you cankerb lossom !
you thief of love !
what !
have you come by night , and stolen my love 's heart from him ?
fine , i ' faith !
have you no modesty , no maiden shame , no touch of bashfulness ?
what !
will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue ?
propn , fie !
you counterfeit , you puppet you !
ay , that way goes the game .
how low am i , thou painted maypole ?
i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes .
i pray you , though you mock me , gentlemen , let her not hurt me .
i was never curst ; i have no gift at all in shrewishness ; i am a right maid for my cowardice ; let her not strike me .
you perhaps may think , because she is something lower than myself , that i can match her .
propn propn , do not be so bitter with me .
i evermore did love you , propn , did ever keep your counsels , never wrong 'd you ; save that , in love unto propn , i told him of your stealth unto this wood .
let me go .
you see how simple and how fond i am .
why , get you gone !
who is't that hinders you ?
a foolish heart that i leave here behind .
what !
with propn ?
with propn .
be not afraid ; she shall not harm thee , propn .
no , sir , she shall not , though you take her part .
propn again !
let me come to her .
get you gone , you dwarf ; you minimus , of hind'ring knot - grass made ; you bead , you acorn .
you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services .
follow !
nay , i 'll go with thee , cheek by jowl .
you , mistress , all this coil is ' long of you .
nay , go not back .
i will not trust you , i ; nor longer stay in your curst company .
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray ; my legs are longer though , to run away .
i am amazed , and know not what to say .
this is thy negligence .
still thou mistakest , or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully .
believe me , king of shadows , i mistook .
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ?
and so far blameless proves my enterprise , that i have ' nointed an propn 's eyes ; and so far am i glad it so did sort , as this their jangling i esteem a sport .
thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight .
hie therefore , propn , overcast the night ; the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as propn , and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within another 's way .
like to propn sometime frame thy tongue , then stir propn up with bitter wrong ; and sometime rail thou like propn ; and from each other look thou lead them thus , till o'er their brows death - counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep .
then crush this herb into propn 's eye ; whose liquor hath this virtuous property , to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight .
when they next wake , all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision ; and back to propn shall the lovers wend , with league whose date till death shall never end .
propn i in this affair do thee employ , i 'll to my queen , and beg her indian boy ; and then i will her charmed eye release from monster 's view , and all things shall be peace .
my fairy lord , this must be done with haste , for night 's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast ; and yonder shines propn 's harbinger , at whose approach , ghosts , wandering here and there , propn home to churchyards .
up and down , up and down , i will lead them up and down .
i am fear 'd in field and town .
propn , lead them up and down .
here comes one .
where art thou , proud propn ?
speak thou now .
here , villain , drawn and ready .
where art thou ?
i will be with thee straight .
follow me , then , to plainer ground .
thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ?
speak !
in some bush ?
where dost thou hide thy head ?
thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , telling the bushes that thou propn for wars , and wilt not come ?
come , recreant , come , thou child ; i 'll whip thee with a rod .
he is defiled that draws a sword on thee .
yea , art thou there ?
follow my voice ; we 'll try no manhood here .
he goes before me , and still dares me on ; when i come where he calls , then he is gone .
come , thou gentle day .
for if but once thou show me thy grey light , i 'll find propn , and revenge this spite .
ho , ho , ho !
propn , why com'st thou not ?
abide me , if thou darest ; for well i wot thou runnest before me , shifting every place , and darest not stand , nor look me in the face .
where art thou now ?
come hither ; i am here .
nay , then , thou propn me .
o weary night , o long and tedious night , abate thy hours !
yet but three ?
come one more ; two of both kinds makes up four .
never so weary , never so in woe , bedabbled with the dew , and torn with briers , i can no further crawl , no further go ; my legs can keep no pace with my desires .
here will i rest me till the break of day .
heavens shield propn , if they mean a fray !
come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , while i thy amiable cheeks do coy , and stick musk - roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy .
where 's propn ?
ready .
ready .
propn propn ; good monsieur , get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red - hipped humble - bee on the top of a thistle ; and , good monsieur , bring me the honey - bag .
ready .
give me your neaf , propn propn .
pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
what 's your will ?
nothing , good monsieur , but to help propn propn to scratch .
i must to the barber 's , monsieur ; for methinks i am marvellous hairy about the face ; and i am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me i must scratch .
what , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
i have a reasonable good ear in music .
or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
truly , a peck of provender ; i could munch your good dry oats .
methinks i have a great desire to a bottle of hay .
good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel 's hoard , and fetch thee new nuts .
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
but , i pray you , let none of your people stir me ; i have an exposition of sleep come upon me .
sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms .
fairies , be gone , and be all ways away .
so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist ; the female ivy so propn the barky fingers of the elm .
o , how i love thee !
how i dote on thee !
welcome , good propn .
propn thou this sweet sight ?
for she his hairy temples then had rounded with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers ; and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wo nt to swell , like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flowerets ' eyes , like tears , that did their own disgrace bewail .
when i had at my pleasure taunted her , and she in mild terms begg 'd my patience , i then did ask of her her changeling child ; which straight she gave me , and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land .
and now i have the boy , i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes .
and , gentle propn , take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain , that he awaking when the other do propn all to propn back again repair , and think no more of this night 's accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream .
but first i will release the fairy queen .
be as thou wast wo nt to be ; see as thou was wo nt to see .
propn 's bud propn propn 's flower propn such force and blessed power .
now , my propn ; wake you , my sweet queen .
my propn !
what visions have i seen !
methought i was enamour 'd of an ass .
there lies your love .
how came these things to pass ?
propn , take off this head .
propn , music call ; and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense .
now when thou wakest with thine own fool 's eyes peep .
sound , music .
come , my propn , take hands with me , and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be .
now thou and i are new in amity , and will tomorrow midnight solemnly propn in propn propn ' house triumphantly , and bless it to all fair prosperity .
there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded , with propn , all in jollity .
fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark .
then , my propn , in silence sad , trip we after night 's shade .
we the globe can compass soon , propn than the wandering moon .
come , my lord ; and in our flight , tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground .
i was with propn and propn once , when in a wood of propn they bay 'd the bear with hounds of propn ; never did i hear such gallant chiding , for , besides the groves , the skies , the fountains , every region near seem 'd all one mutual cry .
i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew 'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; propn - propn and dew - lapp 'd like thessalian bulls ; slow in pursuit , but match 'd in mouth like bells , each under each .
a cry more tuneable was never holla 'd to , nor cheer 'd with horn , in propn , in propn , nor in propn .
my lord , this is my daughter here asleep , and this propn , this propn is , this propn , old propn 's propn .
i wonder of their being here together .
it is , my lord .
go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
good - morrow , friends .
propn propn is past ; begin these wood - birds but to couple now ?
propn , my lord .
i pray you all , stand up .
i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ?
our intent was to be gone from propn , where we might , without the peril of the athenian law .
my lord , fair propn told me of their stealth , of this their purpose hither to this wood ; and i in fury hither followed them , propn propn in fancy following me .
to her , my lord , was i betroth 'd ere i saw propn .
but , like a sickness , did i loathe this food ; but , as in health , come to my natural taste , now i do wish it , love it , long for it , and will for evermore be true to it .
fair lovers , you are fortunately met ; of this discourse we more will hear anon .
propn , i will overbear your will ; for in the temple , by and by , with us these couples shall eternally be knit .
these things seem small and undistinguishable , like far - off mountains turned into clouds .
methinks i see these things with parted eye , when every thing seems double .
yea , and my father .
and propn .
and he did bid us follow to the temple .
wakes ) when my cue comes , call me , and i will answer .
my next is ‘ most fair pyramus. ’ heigh - ho !
propn propn !
flute , the bellows - mender !
snout , the tinker !
starveling !
propn 's my life , stolen hence , and left me asleep !
i have had a most rare vision .
i have had a dream , past the wit of man to say what dream it was .
man is but an ass if he go about to expound this methought i was — there is no man can tell what dream .
methought i was , and methought i had , but man is but a patched fool , if he will offer to say what methought i had .
the eye of man hath not heard , the ear of man hath not seen , man 's hand is not able to taste , his tongue to conceive , nor his heart to report , what my dream was .
i will get propn propn to write a ballad of this dream .
it shall be call 'd ‘ propn 's propn because it hath no bottom ; and i will sing it in the latter end of a play , before the propn .
propn , to make it the more gracious , i shall sing it at her death .
have you sent to propn 's house ?
is he come home yet ?
he can not be heard of .
out of doubt he is transported .
if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ?
it is not possible .
you have not a man in all propn able to discharge propn but he .
no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in propn .
you must say ‘ paragon. ’ a paramour is — propn bless us ! —a thing of naught .
propn , the propn is coming from the temple ; and there is two or three lords and ladies more married .
if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
o sweet bully bottom !
he would have deserved it : sixpence a day in propn , or nothing .
where are these lads ?
where are these hearts ?
o most courageous day !
o most happy hour !
i will tell you everything , right as it fell out .
let us hear , sweet bottom .
not a word of me .
all that i will tell you is , that the propn hath dined .
get your apparel together ; good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps ; meet presently at the palace ; every man look propn his part ; for the short and the long is , our play is preferred .
in any case , let propn have clean linen ; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails , for they shall hang out for the lion 's claws .
and , most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath ; and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy .
no more words .
propn strange , my propn , that these lovers speak of .
more strange than true .
i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys .
lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends .
the lunatic , the lover , and the poet , are of imagination all compact .
one sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; that is the madman .
the lover , all as frantic , propn propn 's beauty in a brow of propn .
the poet 's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , propn glance from propn to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown , the poet 's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name .
such tricks hath strong imagination that , if it would but apprehend some joy , it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ?
but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigured so together , more witnesseth than fancy 's images , and grows to something of great constancy , but howsoever strange and admirable .
here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth .
propn , gentle friends , joy and fresh days of love propn your hearts !
more than to us wait in your royal walks , your board , your bed !
come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours between our after - supper and bed - time ?
where is our usual manager of mirth ?
what revels are in hand ?
is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ?
propn propn .
say , what abridgment have you for this evening ?
what masque ?
what music ?
how shall we beguile the lazy time , if not with some delight ?
there is a brief how many sports are ripe ; make choice of which your propn will see first .
tedious and brief !
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
how shall we find the concord of this discord ?
a play there is , my lord , some ten words long , which is as brief as i have known a play ; but by ten words , my lord , it is too long , which makes it tedious ; for in all the play there is not one word apt , one player fitted .
what are they that do play it ?
hard - handed men that work in propn here , which never labour 'd in their minds till now ; and now have toil 'd their unbreathed memories with this same play against your nuptial .
and we will hear it .
no , my noble lord , it is not for you .
i have heard it over , and it is nothing , nothing in the world ; unless you can find sport in their intents , extremely stretch 'd and conn 'd with cruel pain , to do you service .
i will hear that play ; for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it .
i love not to see wretchedness o'er - charged , and duty in his service perishing .
why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
he says they can do nothing in this kind .
the kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing .
our sport shall be to take what they mistake ; and what poor duty can not do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit .
where i have come , great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , make periods in the midst of sentences , propn their practised accent in their fears , and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome .
trust me , sweet , out of this silence yet i picked a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence .
love , therefore , and tongue - tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity .
so please your grace , the propn is address 'd .
let him approach .
if we offend , it is with our good will .
that you should think , we come not to offend , but with good will .
to show our simple skill , that is the true beginning of our end .
consider then , we come but in despite .
we do not come , as minding to content you , our true intent is .
all for your delight we are not here .
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt ; he knows not the stop .
indeed he hath play 'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder , — a sound , but not in government .
his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered .
who is next ?
propn , perchance you wonder at this show ; but wonder on , till truth make all things plain .
this man is propn , if you would know ; this beauteous lady propn is certain .
this man , with lanthorn , dog , and bush of thorn , propn propn ; for , if you will know , by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at propn ' tomb , there , there to woo .
this grisly beast , which propn hight by name , the trusty propn , coming first by night , did scare away , or rather did affright ; and as she fled , her mantle she did fall ; which propn vile with bloody mouth did stain .
for all the rest , let propn , propn , propn , and lovers twain , at large discourse while here they do remain .
i wonder if the lion be to speak .
would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse , my lord .
propn draws near the wall ; silence .
o grim - look 'd night !
o night with hue so black !
o night , which ever art when day is not !
thanks , courteous wall .
jove shield thee well for this !
but what see i ?
no propn do i see .
o wicked wall , through whom i see no bliss , propn he thy stones for thus deceiving me !
the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
no , in truth , sir , he should not .
deceiving me is propn 's cue .
she is to enter now , and i am to spy her through the wall .
you shall see it will fall pat as i told you ; yonder she comes .
o wall , full often hast thou heard my moans , for parting my fair propn and me !
i see a voice ; now will i to the chink , to spy an i can hear my propn 's face .
thisbe !
my love !
thou art my love , i think .
think what thou wilt , i am thy lover 's grace ; and like propn am i trusty still .
and i like propn , till the propn me kill .
not propn to propn was so true .
as propn to propn , i to you .
o , kiss me through the hole of this vile wall .
i kiss the wall 's hole , not your lips at all .
propn thou at propn 's tomb meet me straightway ?
tide life , ' tide death , i come without delay .
thus have i , wall , my part discharged so ; and , being done , thus propn away doth go .
now is the mural down between the two neighbors .
no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning .
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard .
the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them .
it must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men .
here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
you , ladies , you , whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor , propn now , perchance , both quake and tremble here , when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar .
a very gentle beast , and of a good conscience .
the very best at a beast , my lord , that e'er i saw .
this lion is a very fox for his valour .
true ; and a goose for his discretion .
not so , my lord ; for his valour can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
his discretion , i am sure , can not carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox .
he is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference .
this lanthorn doth the horned moon present ; myself the man i ' the moon do seem to be .
how is it else the man i ' the moon ?
he dares not come there for the candle ; for , you see , it is already in snuff .
i am aweary of this moon .
would he would change !
it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane ; but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must stay the time .
propn , propn .
all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon ; i , the man i ' the moon ; this thorn - bush , my thorn - bush ; and this dog , my dog .
why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon .
but silence ; here comes propn .
this is old propn 's tomb .
where is my love ?
well run , propn .
well moused , propn .
and then came propn .
and so the lion vanished .
but stay , o spite !
but mark , poor knight , what dreadful dole is here !
eyes , do you see ?
how can it he ?
o dainty duck !
o dear !
thy mantle good , what !
stain 'd with blood ?
approach , propn propn fell .
o fates !
come , come ; cut thread and thrum ; propn , crush , conclude , and quell .
this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad .
beshrew my heart , but i pity the man .
o wherefore , nature , didst thou lions frame ?
since lion vile hath here deflower 'd my dear ; which is — no , no — which was the fairest dame that lived , that loved , that liked , that looked with cheer .
come , tears , confound ; out , sword , and wound the pap of propn ; ay , that left pap , where heart doth hop .
thus die i , thus , thus , thus .
now am i dead , now am i fled ; my soul is in the sky .
now die , die , die , die , die .
no die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one .
less than an ace , man ; for he is dead ; he is nothing .
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass .
how chance propn is gone before propn comes back and finds her lover ?
a mote will turn the balance , which propn , which propn , is the better , — he for a man , propn warrant us : she for a woman , propn bless us !
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
and thus she moans , propn propn , my love ?
what , dead , my dove ?
o propn , arise , speak , speak .
quite dumb ?
dead , dead ?
a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes .
o propn three , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk ; lay them in gore , since you have shore with shears his thread of silk .
dies ] [ propn ] propn and propn are left to bury the dead .
ay , and propn too .
no , i assure you ; the wall is down that parted their fathers .
will it please you to see the epilogue , or to hear a propn dance between two of our company ?
no epilogue , i pray you ; for your play needs no excuse .
never excuse ; for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed .
marry , if he that writ it had played propn , and hanged himself in propn 's garter , it would have been a fine tragedy .
and so it is , truly ; and very notably discharged .
but come , your bergomask ; let your epilogue alone .
i fear we shall out - sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch 'd .
through the house give glimmering light , by the dead and drowsy fire ; every elf and fairy sprite propn as light as bird from brier ; and this ditty , after me , sing and dance it trippingly .
now , until the break of day , through this house each fairy stray .
to the best bride - bed will we , which by us shall blessed be ; and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate .
trip away ; make no stay ; meet me all by break of day .
if we shadows have offended , think but this , and all is mended , that you have but slumber 'd here while these visions did appear .
and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , propn , do not reprehend .
so , good night unto you all .
give me your hands , if we be friends , and propn shall restore amends .
tush , never tell me !
i take it much unkindly that thou , propn , who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this .
sblood , but you will not hear me .
if ever i did dream of such a matter , abhor me .
thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate .
despise me , if i do not .
propn , a great arithmetician , one propn propn , a propn a fellow almost damn 'd in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field , nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster ; unless the bookish theoric , where in the toga 'd consuls can propose as masterly as he ; mere prattle without practice , is all his soldiership .
by propn , i rather would have been his hangman .
why , there 's no remedy .
propn the curse of service , propn goes by letter and affection , and not by old gradation , where each second stood heir to the first .
now , sir , be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the propn .
i would not follow him then .
you shall mark many a duteous and kneecrooking knave , that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time , much like his master 's ass , for naught but provender ; and , when he 's old , cashier 'd .
whip me such honest knaves .
others there are , who , trimm 'd in forms and visages of duty , keep yet their hearts attending on themselves , and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them ; and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage .
these fellows have some soul , and such a one do i profess myself .
for , sir , it is as sure as you are propn , were i the propn , i would not be propn .
what a full fortune does the thicklips owe , if he can carry't thus !
though that his joy be joy , yet throw such changes of vexation o n't as it may lose some color .
do ; with like timorous accent and dire yell as when , by night and negligence , the fire is spied in populous cities .
what , ho , propn !
propn propn , ho !
propn !
what , ho , propn !
thieves !
thieves !
thieves !
look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
thieves !
thieves !
what is the reason of this terrible summons ?
what is the matter there ?
propn , is all your family within ?
are your doors lock 'd ?
arise , i say !
what , have you lost your wits ?
most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?
what are you ?
my name is propn .
the worser welcome .
i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors : in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee ; and now , in madness , — being full of supper and distempering draughts , — upon malicious bravery , dost thou come to start my quiet .
propn , sir , sir— but thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee .
patience , good sir .
what tell'st thou me of robbing ?
this is propn ; my house is not a grange .
most grave propn , in simple and pure soul i come to you .
zounds , sir , you are one of those that will not serve propn , if the devil bid you .
because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you 'll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse ; you 'll have your nephews neigh to you ; you 'll have coursers for cousins , and gennets for germans .
what profane wretch art thou ?
i am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the propn are now making the beast with two backs .
thou art a villain .
you are — a senator .
propn , i will answer any thing .
give me a taper !
call up all my people !
propn , for i must leave you .
it seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , to be produced — as , if i stay , i shall— against the propn .
for i do know , the state , however this may gall him with some check , can not with safety cast him ; for he 's embark 'd with such loud reason to the propn ' wars , which even now stands in act , that , for their souls , another of his fathom they have none to lead their business ; in which regard , though i do hate him as i do hell - pains , yet for necessity of present life , i must show out a flag and sign of love , which is indeed but sign .
that you shall surely find him , lead to the propn the raised search , and there will i be with him .
so farewell .
how didst thou know ' twas she ?
raise all my kindred .
are they married , think you ?
truly , i think they are .
o heaven ! —how got she out ?
o treason of the blood !
fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds by what you see them act .
have you not read , propn , of some such thing ?
yes , sir , i have indeed .
call up my brother .
do you know where we may apprehend her and the propn ?
i think i can discover him , if you please to get good guard , and go along with me .
pray you , lead on .
though in the trade of war i have slain men , yet do i hold it very stuff o ' the conscience to do no contrived murder .
i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service .
nine or ten times i had thought to have yerk 'd him here under the ribs .
propn better as it is .
nay , but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that , with the little godliness i have , i did full hard forbear him .
but i pray you , sir , are you fast married ?
be assured of this , that the magnifico is much beloved , and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the propn 's .
he will divorce you , or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law , with all his might to enforce it on , will give him cable .
let him do his spite .
my services , which i have done the signiory , propn out - tongue his complaints .
but , look !
what lights come yond ?
those are the raised father and his friends .
you were best go in .
is it they ?
by propn , i think no .
the goodness of the night upon you , friends !
what is the news ?
the propn does greet you , general , and he requires your haste - post - haste appearance , even on the instant .
what is the matter , think you ?
the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another 's heels ; and many of the consuls , raised and met , are at the propn 's already .
you have been hotly call 'd for ; when , being not at your lodging to be found , the propn hath sent about three quests to search you out .
propn well i am found by you .
i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you .
ancient , what makes he here ?
i do not understand .
he 's married .
to who ?
marry , to — come , captain , will you go ?
have with you .
here comes another troop to seek for you .
it is propn .— propn , be advised ; he comes to bad intent .
propn !
stand there !
propn , it is the propn .
you , propn !
come , sir , i am for you .
o thou foul thief , where hast thou stow 'd my daughter ?
propn as thou art , thou hast enchanted her , for i 'll refer me to all things of sense , if she in chains of magic were not bound , whether a maid so tender , fair , and happy , so opposite to marriage that she shunn 'd the wealthy , curled darlings of our nation , would ever have , to incur a general mock , run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou — to fear , not to delight .
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world , a practicer of arts inhibited and out of propn propn hold upon him .
if he do resist , propn him at his peril .
to prison ; till fit time of law and course of direct session , call thee to answer .
what if i do obey ?
how may the propn be therewith satisfied , whose messengers are here about my side , upon some present business of the state to bring me to him ?
propn true , most worthy signior ; the propn 's in council , and your noble self , i am sure , is sent for .
how ?
the propn in council ?
the propn himself , or any of my brothers of the state , can not but feel this wrong as ' twere their own ; for if such actions may have passage free , bond - slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
there is no composition in these news that gives them credit .
indeed they are disproportion 'd ; my letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
and mine , a hundred and forty .
and mine , two hundred .
what , ho !
what , ho !
what , ho !
a messenger from the galleys .
now , what 's the business ?
the turkish preparation makes for rhodes ; so was i bid report here to the state by propn propn .
how say you by this change ?
nay , in all confidence , he 's not for propn .
here is more news .
the propn , reverend and gracious , steering with due course toward the isle of propn , have there injointed them with an after fleet .
ay , so i thought .
how many , as you guess ?
propn propn , your trusty and most valiant servitor , with his free duty recommends you thus , and prays you to believe him .
propn certain then for propn .
propn propn , is not he in town ?
he 's now in propn .
write from us to him , postposthaste dispatch .
here comes propn and the valiant propn .
propn propn , we must straight employ you against the general enemy propn .
i did not see you ; welcome , gentle signior ; we lack 'd your counsel and your help tonight .
so did i yours .
why , what 's the matter ?
my daughter !
o , my daughter !
dead ?
whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding propn thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her , the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense .
humbly i thank your grace .
here is the man , this propn ; whom now , it seems , your special mandate for the state affairs propn hither brought .
we are very sorry for't .
what in your own part can you say to this ?
nothing , but this is so .
most potent , grave , and reverend signiors , my very noble and approved good masters , that i have ta'en away this old man 's daughter , it is most true ; true , i have married her ; the very head and front of my offending propn this extent , no more .
propn am i in my speech , and little blest with the soft phrase of peace ; for since these arms of mine had seven years ' pith , till now some nine moons wasted , they have used their dearest action in the tented field , and little of this great world can i speak , more than pertains to feats of broil and battle ; and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself .
yet , by your gracious patience , i will a round unvarnish 'd tale deliver of my whole course of love : what drugs , what charms , what conjuration , and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter .
a maiden never bold ; of spirit so still and quiet that her motion propn at herself ; and she — in spite of nature , of years , of country , credit , everything— to fall in love with what she fear 'd to look on !
it is judgement maim 'd and most imperfect , that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature , i therefore vouch again , that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood , or with some dram conjured to this effect , he wrought upon her .
to vouch this , is no proof , without more certain and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him .
but , propn , speak .
did you by indirect and forced courses propn and poison this young maid 's affections ?
or came it by request , and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth ?
fetch propn hither .
ancient , conduct them ; you best know the place .
and till she come , as truly as to propn i do confess the vices of my blood , so justly to your grave ears i 'll present how i did thrive in this fair lady 's love and she in mine .
say it , propn .
her father loved me , oft invited me , still question 'd me the story of my life from year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , that i have pass 'd .
this to hear would propn seriously incline ; but still the house affairs would draw her thence , which ever as she could with haste dispatch , propn come again , and with a greedy ear propn up my discourse ; which i observing , took once a pliant hour , and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate , propn by parcels she had something heard , but not intentively .
i did consent , and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer 'd .
this only is the witchcraft i have used .
here comes the lady ; let her witness it .
i think this tale would win my daughter too .
my noble father , i do perceive here a divided duty .
to you i am bound for life and education ; my life and education both do learn me how to respect you ; you are the lord of duty , i am hitherto your daughter .
but here 's my husband , and so much duty as my mother show 'd to you , preferring you before her father , so much i challenge that i may profess due to the propn , my lord .
propn be with you !
i have done .
for your sake , jewel , i am glad at soul i have no other child ; for thy escape would teach me tyranny , to hang clogs on them .
i have done , my lord .
let me speak like yourself , and lay a sentence which , as a grise or step , may help these lovers into your favor .
when remedies are past , the griefs are ended by seeing the worst , which late on hopes depended .
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on .
what can not be preserved when fortune takes , patience her injury a mockery makes .
the robb 'd that smiles steals something from the thief ; he robs himself that spends a bootless grief .
these sentences , to sugar or to gall , being strong on both sides , are equivocal .
i humbly beseech you , proceed to the affairs of state .
the propn with a most mighty preparation makes for propn .
othello , the fortitude of the place is best known to you ; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion , a sovereign mistress of effects , throws a more safer voice on you .
you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition .
the tyrant custom , most grave senators , propn made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down .
i do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness ; and do undertake these present wars against the propn .
most humbly therefore bending to your state , i crave fit disposition for my wife , due reference of place and exhibition , with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding .
nor i .
nor i. i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye .
most gracious propn , to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear .
what would you , propn ?
that i did love the propn to live with him , my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world .
so that , dear lords , if i be left behind , a moth of peace , and he go to the war , the rites for which i love him are bereft me , and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence .
let me go with him .
let her have your voices .
no , when lightwing 'd toys of feather 'd propn seel with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments , that my disports corrupt and taint my business , let housewives make a skillet of my helm , and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation !
tonight , my lord ?
this night .
with all my heart .
at nine i ' the morning here we 'll meet again .
othello , leave some officer behind , and he shall our commission bring to you ; with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you .
let it be so .
good night to everyone .
and , noble signior , if virtue no delighted beauty lack , your son - in - law is far more fair than black .
propn , brave propn , use propn well .
my life upon her faith !
iago !
what say'st thou , noble heart ?
what will i do , thinkest thou ?
why , go to bed and sleep .
i will incontinently drown myself .
if thou dost , i shall never love thee after .
why , thou silly gentleman !
it is silliness to live when to live is torment , and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician .
o villainous !
i have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury , i never found man that knew how to love himself .
propn i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , i would change my humanity with a baboon .
what should i do ?
i confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it .
virtue ?
a fig !
propn in ourselves that we are thus or thus .
if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions .
it can not be .
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
come , be a man !
drown thyself ?
drown cats and blind puppies !
put money in thy purse ; follow thou the wars ; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard .
it was a violent commencement , and thou shalt see an answer- able sequestration ; put but money in thy purse .
these moors are changeable in their wills : — fill thy purse with money .
the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts , shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida .
if thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
a pox of drowning thyself !
it is clean out of the way .
seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her .
wilt thou be fast to my hopes , if i depend on the issue ?
i have told thee often , and i retell thee again and again , i hate the propn .
my cause is hearted ; thine hath no less reason .
let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .
if thou canst cuckold him , thou dost thyself a pleasure , me a sport .
there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered .
propn , go , provide thy money .
we will have more of this tomorrow .
propn .
where shall we meet i ' the morning ?
at my lodging .
i 'll be with thee betimes .
go to , farewell .
do you hear , propn ?
what say you ?
no more of drowning , do you hear ?
thus do i ever make my fool my purse ; for i mine own gain 'd knowledge should profane , if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit .
i hate the propn ; and it is thought abroad that ' twixt my sheets he has done my office .
i know not if't be true ; but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety .
he holds me well ; the better shall my purpose work on him .
propn 's a proper man .
let me see now : to get his place , and to plume up my will in double knavery — how , how ?
he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected ; framed to make women false .
the propn is of a free and open nature , that thinks men honest that but seem to be so ; and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are .
i have't .
it is engender 'd .
hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world 's light .
what from the cape can you discern at sea ?
nothing at all .
it is a highwrought flood ; i can not , ' twixt the heaven and the main , propn a sail .
what shall we hear of this ?
if that the turkish fleet be not enshelter 'd and embay 'd , they are drown 'd ; it is impossible to bear it out .
news , lads !
our wars are done .
how ?
is this true ?
i am glad o n't ; ' tis a worthy governor .
but this same propn , though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss , yet he looks sadly and prays the propn be safe ; for they were parted with foul and violent tempest .
pray heavens he be ; for i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier .
come , let 's do so ; for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance .
thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle , that so approve the propn !
o , let the heavens give him defense against the elements , for i have lost him on a dangerous sea .
is he well shipp 'd ?
his bark is stoutly timber 'd , and his pilot of very expert and approved allowance ; therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , stand in bold cure .
a sail , a sail , a sail !
what noise ?
the town is empty ; on the brow o ' the sea propn ranks of people , and they cry , “ a sail ! ” my hopes do shape him for the governor .
i pray you , sir , go forth , and give us truth who ' tis that is arrived .
i shall .
but , good lieutenant , is your general wived ?
how now !
who has put in ?
propn one propn , ancient to the general .
what is she ?
she that i spake of , our great captain 's captain , left in the conduct of the bold propn ; whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a se'nnight 's speed .
propn propn , propn guard , and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath , that he may bless this bay with his tall ship , make love 's quick pants in propn 's arms , give renew 'd fire to our extincted spirits , and bring all propn comfort .
o , behold , the riches of the ship is come on shore !
ye men of propn , let her have your knees .
hail to thee , lady !
and the grace of propn , before , behind thee , and on every hand , propn thee round !
i thank you , valiant propn .
what tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
he is not yet arrived ; nor know i aught but that he 's well and will be shortly here .
o , but i fear — how lost you company ?
the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship — but , hark !
a sail .
see for the news .
good ancient , you are welcome .
welcome , mistress .
propn , would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me , propn have enough .
alas , she has no speech .
in faith , too much ; i find it still when i have list to sleep : marry , before your ladyship , i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking .
you have little cause to say so .
o , fie upon thee , slanderer !
you shall not write my praise .
no , let me not .
what wouldst thou write of me , if thou shouldst praise me ?
o gentle lady , do not put me to't ; for i am nothing if not critical .
ay , madam .
i am not merry , but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise .
come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
i am about it ; but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze ; it plucks out brains and all .
but my propn labors , and thus she is deliver 'd .
if she be fair and wise , fairness and wit , the one 's for use , the other useth it .
well praised !
how if she be black and witty ?
if she be black , and thereto have a wit , she 'll find a white that shall her blackness fit .
worse and worse .
how if fair and foolish ?
she never yet was foolish that was fair ; for even her folly help 'd her to an heir .
these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i ' the alehouse .
what miserable praise hast thou for her that 's foul and foolish ?
thou praisest the worst best .
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
o most lame and impotent conclusion !
do not learn of him , propn , though he be thy husband .
how say you , propn ?
is he not a most profane and liberal counselor ?
he speaks home , madam .
you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as propn .
ay , smile upon her , do ; i will gyve thee in thine own courtship .
you say true ; ' tis so , indeed .
if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft , which now again you are most apt to play the sir in .
an excellent courtesy !
tis so , indeed .
yet again your fingers to your lips ?
would they were clysterpipes for your sake !
the propn !
i know his trumpet .
propn truly so .
let 's meet him and receive him .
propn , where he comes !
o my fair warrior !
my dear othello !
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me .
o my soul 's joy !
if after every tempest come such calms , may the winds blow till they have waken 'd death !
and let the laboring bark climb hills of seas olympus high , and duck again as low as hell 's from propn !
if it were now to die , ' twere now to be most happy ; for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this propn in unknown fate .
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase , even as our days do grow !
amen to that , sweet powers !
i can not speak enough of this content ; it stops me here ; it is too much of joy : and this , and this , the greatest discords be they kiss .
o , you are well tuned now !
but i 'll set down the pegs that make this music , as honest as i am .
come , let us to the castle .
news , friends : our wars are done , the propn are drown 'd .
propn , you shall be well desired in propn ; i have found great love amongst them .
o my sweet , i prattle out of fashion , and i dote in mine own comforts .
come , propn , once more well met at propn .
do thou meet me presently at the harbor .
come hither .
if thou be'st valiant — as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them — list me .
the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard .
first , i must tell thee this : propn is directly in love with him .
with him ?
why , ' tis not possible .
lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .
mark me with what violence she first loved the propn , but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies .
and will she love him still for prating ?
let not thy discreet heart think it .
her eye must be fed ; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil ?
when the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be , again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite , loveliness in favor , sympathy in years , manners , and beauties ; all which the propn is defec- tive in .
now sir , this granted — as it is a most pregnant and unforced position — who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as propn does ?
a knave very voluble ; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming , for the better com- passing of his salt and most hidden loose affection ?
i can not believe that in her ; she 's full of most blest condition .
blest fig'send !
the wine she drinks is made of grapes .
if she had been blest , she would never have loved the propn .
blest pudding !
propn thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand ?
didst not mark that ?
yes , that i did ; but that was but courtesy .
propn , by this hand ; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts .
they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
villainous thoughts , propn !
when these mutualities so marshal the way , hard at hand comes the master and main exercise , the incorporate conclusion .
pish !
but , sir , be you ruled by me .
i have brought you from propn .
propn knows you not .
i 'll not be far from you .
do you find some occasion to anger propn , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .
provoke him , that he may ; for even out of that will i cause these of propn to mutiny , whose qual- ification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of propn .
so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them , and the impediment most profitably removed , with- out the which there were no expectation of our prosperity .
i warrant thee .
meet me by and by at the citadel .
i must fetch his necessaries ashore .
propn .
propn .
it is propn 's pleasure , our noble and valiant general , that upon certain tidings now arrived , importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet , every man put himself into triumph ; some to dance , some to make bonfires , each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him ; for besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .
all offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven .
propn bless the isle of propn and our noble general othello !
iago hath direction what to do ; but notwithstanding , with my personal eye will i look to't .
propn is most honest .
propn , good night .
tomorrow with your earliest let me have speech with you .
come , my dear love , the purchase made , the fruits are to ensue ; that profit 's yet to come ' tween me and you .
good night .
welcome , iago ; we must to the watch .
not this hour , lieutenant ; ' tis not yet ten o ' the clock .
our general cast us thus early for the love of his propn ; who let us not therefore blame .
he hath not yet made wan- ton the night with her , and she is sport for propn .
she 's a most exquisite lady .
and , i 'll warrant her , full of game .
indeed she 's a most fresh and delicate creature .
what an eye she has !
methinks it sounds a parley to provocation .
an inviting eye ; and yet methinks right modest .
and when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
she is indeed perfection .
well , happiness to their sheets !
come , lieutenant , i have a stoup of wine , and here without are a brace of propn gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello .
i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
o , they are our friends !
but one cup ; i 'll drink for you .
i have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily qualified too , and behold what innovation it makes here .
i am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more .
what , man !
where are they ?
here at the door ; i pray you , call them in .
i 'll do't , but it dislikes me .
if i can fasten but one cup upon him , with that which he hath drunk tonight already , he 'll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress ' dog .
now , ' mongst this flock of drunkards , am i to put our propn in some action that may offend the isle .
some wine , ho !
and let me the canakin clink , clink ; [ sings .
fore propn , an excellent song .
i learned it in propn , where indeed they are most potent in potting .
is your propn so expert in his drinking ?
why , he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your propn ; he gives your propn a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled .
to the health of our general !
propn propn was a worthy peer , his breeches cost him but a crown ; he held them sixpence all too dear , with that he call 'd the tailor lown .
will you hear't again ?
it 's true , good lieutenant .
for mine own part — no offense to the general , nor any man of quality — i hope to be saved .
and so do i too , lieutenant .
let 's have no more of this ; let 's to our affairs .
propn forgive us our sins !
gentlemen , let 's look to our business .
i am not drunk now ; i can stand well enough , and i speak well enough .
excellent well .
and do but see his vice ; ' propn to his virtue a just equinox , the one as long as the other .
propn pity of him .
i fear the trust propn puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island .
but is he often thus ?
propn evermore the prologue to his sleep ; he 'll watch the propn a double set , if drink rock not his cradle .
it were well the general were put in mind of it .
how now , propn !
i pray you , after the lieutenant ; go .
what noise ?
you rogue !
you rascal !
what 's the matter , lieutenant ?
a knave teach me my duty !
but i 'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
beat me !
nay , good lieutenant ; i pray you , sir , hold your hand .
let me go , sir , or i 'll knock you o'er the mazzard .
come , come , you 're drunk .
drunk !
what is the matter here ?
zounds , i bleed still ; i am hurt to the death .
hold , for your lives !
hold , ho ! —lieutenant — propn — propn — gentlemen— have you forgot all place of sense and duty ?
hold !
why , how now , ho !
from whence ariseth this ?
are we propn propn , and to ourselves do that which propn hath forbid the propn ?
what is the matter , masters ?
propn propn , that look'st dead with grieving , speak , who began this ?
how comes it , propn , you are thus forgot ?
i pray you , pardon me ; i can not speak .
propn propn , you were wo nt be civil ; the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted , and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure .
what 's the matter , that you unlace your reputation thus , and spend your rich opinion for the name of a nightbrawler ?
give me answer to it .
nor know i aught by me that 's said or done amiss this night ; unless self - charity be sometimes a vice , and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us .
now , by propn , my blood begins my safer guides to rule , and passion , having my best judgement collied , propn to lead the way .
if i once stir , or do but lift this arm , the best of you shall sink in my rebuke .
give me to know how this foul rout began , who set it on , and he that is approved in this offense , though he had twinn 'd with me , both at a birth , shall lose me .
what !
in a town of war , yet wild , the people 's hearts brimful of fear , to manage private and domestic quarrel , in night , and on the court and guard of safety !
propn monstrous .
propn , who bega n't ?
if partially affined , or leagued in office , propn dost deliver more or less than truth , thou art no soldier .
touch me not so near : i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to propn propn ; yet , i persuade myself , to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him .
thus it is , general .
propn and myself being in speech , there comes a fellow crying out for help , and propn following him with determined sword , to execute upon him .
he , swift of foot , propn my purpose ; and i return 'd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords , and propn high in oath , which till tonight i ne'er might say before .
when i came back— for this was brief —i found them close together , at blow and thrust , even as again they were when you yourself did part them .
more of this matter can not i report .
but men are men ; the best sometimes forget : propn propn did some little wrong to him , as men in rage strike those that wish them best , yet surely propn , i believe , received from him that fled some strange indignity , which patience could not pass .
i know , propn , propn honesty and love doth mince this matter , making it light to propn .
propn , i love thee ; but never more be officer of mine .
look , if my gentle love be not raised up !
i 'll make thee an example .
what 's the matter ?
all 's well now , sweeting ; come away to bed .
propn , for your hurts , myself will be your surgeon .
lead him off .
iago , look with care about the town , and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted .
what , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
ay , past all surgery .
propn , propn forbid !
reputation , reputation , reputation !
o , i have lost my reputation !
i have lost the immortal part of myself , and what remains is bestial .
my reputation , propn , my reputation !
as i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound ; there is more sense in that than in reputa- tion .
reputation is an idle and most false imposition ; oft got without merit and lost without deserving .
you have lost no reputation at all , unless you repute yourself such a loser .
what , man !
there are ways to recover the general again .
you are but now cast in his mood , a punishment more in policy than in malice ; even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion .
propn to him again , and he 's yours .
i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer .
drunk ?
and speak parrot ?
and squabble ?
swagger ?
swear ?
and discourse fustian with one 's own shadow ?
o thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
what was he that you followed with your sword ?
what had he done to you ?
i know not .
is't possible ?
i remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly ; a quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
o propn , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains !
that we should , with joy , pleasance , revel , and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
why , but you are now well enough .
how came you thus recovered ?
come , you are too severe a moraler .
as the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , i could heartily wish this had not befallen ; but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
i will ask him for my place again ; he shall tell me i am a drunkard !
had i as many mouths as propn , such an answer would stop them all .
to be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
o strange !
every inordinate cup is unblest , and the ingredient is a devil .
come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used .
propn no more against it .
and , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you .
i have well approved it , sir .
i drunk !
you or any man living may be drunk at some time , man .
i 'll tell you what you shall do .
confess yourself freely to her ; importune her help to put you in your place again .
she is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested .
this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter ; and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
you advise me well .
i protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
you are in the right .
good night , lieutenant , i must to the watch .
good night , honest iago .
and what 's he then that says i play the villain ?
when this advice is free i give and honest , propn to thinking , and indeed the course to win the propn again ?
for ' tis most easy the inclining propn to subdue in any honest suit .
she 's framed as fruitful as the free elements .
and then for her to win the propn , were't to renounce his baptism , all seals and symbols of redeemed sin , his soul is so enfetter 'd to her love , that she may make , unmake , do what she list , even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function .
how am i then a villain to counsel propn to this parallel course , directly to his good ?
divinity of hell !
so will i turn her virtue into pitch , and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all .
how now , propn !
i do follow here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts , but one that fills up the cry .
how poor are they that have not patience !
what wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , and wit depends on dilatory time .
does't not go well ?
by the mass , ' tis morning ; pleasure and action make the hours seem short .
propn thee ; go where thou art billeted : away , i say .
thou shalt know more hereafter : nay , get thee gone .
masters , play here , i will content your pains ; something that 's brief ; and bid “ good morrow , general . ” why , masters , have your instruments been in propn , that they speak i ' the nose thus ?
how , sir , how ?
are these , i pray you , wind instruments ?
ay , marry , are they , sir .
whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
marry , sir .
well , sir , we will not .
we have none such , sir .
then put up your pipes in your bag , for i 'll away .
dost thou hear , my honest friend ?
no , i hear not your honest friend ; i hear you .
prithee , keep up thy quillets .
there 's a poor piece of gold for thee .
if the gentlewoman that attends the general 's wife be stirring , tell her there 's one propn entreats her a little favor of speech .
wilt thou do this ?
do , good my friend .
in happy time , propn .
you have not been abed , then ?
why , no ; the day had broke before we parted .
i have made bold , propn , to send in to your wife .
my suit to her is that she will to virtuous propn procure me some access .
i 'll send her to you presently ; and i 'll devise a mean to draw the propn out of the way , that your converse and business may be more free .
i humbly thank you for't .
i never knew a propn more kind and honest .
the general and his wife are talking of it , and she speaks for you stoutly .
the propn replies that he you hurt is of great fame in propn and great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you ; but he protests he loves you , and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again .
yet , i beseech you , if you think fit , or that it may be done , give me advantage of some brief discourse with propn alone .
pray you , come in .
i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely .
i am much bound to you .
well , my good lord , i 'll do't .
this fortification , gentlemen , shall we see't ?
we 'll wait upon your lordship .
be thou assured , good propn , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf .
o , that 's an honest fellow .
do not doubt , propn , but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were .
bounteous madam , whatever shall become of propn propn , he 's never anything but your true servant .
ay , but , lady , that policy may either last so long , or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , or breed itself so out of circumstances , that i being absent and my place supplied , my general will forget my love and service .
my lord shall never rest ; i 'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience ; his bed shall seem a school , his board a shrift ; i 'll intermingle everything he does with propn 's suit .
therefore be merry , propn , for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away .
propn , here comes my lord .
propn , i 'll take my leave .
nay , stay and hear me speak .
propn , not now .
i am very ill at ease , propn for mine own purposes .
well , do your discretion .
ha !
i like not that .
what dost thou say ?
was not that propn parted from my wife ?
propn , my lord !
no , sure , i can not think it , that he would steal away so guiltylike , seeing you coming .
i do believe ' twas he .
how now , my lord !
i have been talking with a suitor here , a man that languishes in your displeasure .
who is't you mean ?
why , your lieutenant , propn .
went he hence now ?
ay , sooth ; so humbled , that he hath left part of his grief with me , to suffer with him .
good love , call him back .
not now , sweet propn ; some other time .
but shall't be shortly ?
the sooner , sweet , for you .
shall't be tonight at supper ?
no , not tonight .
tomorrow dinner then ?
i shall not dine at home ; i meet the captains at the citadel .
in faith , he 's penitent ; and yet his trespass , in our common reason— propn that , they say , the wars must make examples out of their best — is not almost a fault to incur a private check .
when shall he come ?
tell me , propn .
i wonder in my soul , what you would ask me , that i should deny , or stand so mammering on .
what ?
nay , when i have a suit— propn i mean to touch your love indeed , it shall be full of poise and difficult weight , and fearful to be granted .
shall i deny you ?
no .
propn , my lord .
emilia , come .
be as your fancies teach you ; propn you be , i am obedient .
excellent wretch !
perdition catch my soul , but i do love thee !
and when i love thee not , propn is come again .
did propn propn , when you woo 'd my lady , propn of your love ?
he did , from first to last .
why dost thou ask ?
but for a satisfaction of my thought ; no further harm .
why of thy thought , propn ?
i did not think he had been acquainted with her .
o , yes , and went between us very oft .
indeed !
indeed ?
ay , indeed .
propn thou aught in that ?
is he not honest ?
honest , my lord ?
honest ?
ay , honest .
my lord , for aught i know .
what dost thou think ?
think , my lord ?
think , my lord ?
by propn , he echoes me , as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown .
what didst not like ?
if thou dost love me , show me thy thought .
my lord , you know i love you .
i think thou dost ; and for i know thou'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath , therefore these stops of thine fright me the more ; for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom ; but in a man that 's just they 're close dilations , working from the heart , that passion can not rule .
for propn propn , i dare be sworn i think that he is honest .
i think so too .
men should be what they seem ; or those that be not , would they might seem none !
certain , men should be what they seem .
why then i think propn 's an honest man .
utter my thoughts ?
why , say they are vile and false ; as where 's that palace where in to foul things sometimes intrude not ?
who has a breast so pure , but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and lawdays , and in session sit with meditations lawful ?
thou dost conspire against thy friend , propn , if thou but think'st him wrong 'd and makest his ear a stranger to thy thoughts .
i do beseech you— though i perchance am vicious in my guess , as , i confess , it is my nature 's plague to spy into abuses , and oft my jealousy propn faults that are not — that your wisdom yet , from one that so imperfectly conceits , would take no notice , nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance .
it were not for your quiet nor your good , nor for my manhood , honesty , or wisdom , to let you know my thoughts .
what dost thou mean ?
by propn , i 'll know thy thoughts .
you can not , if my heart were in your hand ; nor shall not , whilst ' tis in my custody .
ha !
that cuckold lives in bliss who , certain of his fate , loves not his wronger ; but o , what damned minutes tells he propn who dotes , yet doubts , suspects , yet strongly loves !
o misery !
why , why is this ?
think'st thou propn make a life of jealousy , to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions ?
exchange me for a goat , when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises , matching thy inference .
propn not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances well ; where virtue is , these are more virtuous .
nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt ; for she had eyes and chose me .
no , propn , i 'll see before i doubt ; when i doubt , prove ; and on the proof , there is no more but this , away at once with love or jealousy !
i am glad of it , for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit .
therefore , as i am bound , receive it from me .
i speak not yet of proof .
look to your wife ; observe her well with propn ; wear your eye thus , not jealous nor secure .
i know our country disposition well ; in propn they do let propn see the pranks they dare not show their husbands ; their best conscience is not to leave't undone , but keep't unknown .
dost thou say so ?
she did deceive her father , marrying you ; and when she seem 'd to shake and fear your looks , she loved them most .
and so she did .
i am bound to thee forever .
i see this hath a little dash 'd your spirits .
not a jot , not a jot .
i ' faith , i fear it has .
i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love .
but i do see you 're moved ; i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues , nor to larger reach than to suspicion .
i will not .
should you do so , my lord , my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aim not at .
no , not much moved .
i do not think but propn 's honest .
long live she so !
and long live you to think so !
but pardon me .
i do not in position distinctly speak of her ; though i may fear , her will , recoiling to her better judgement , may fall to match you with her country forms , and happily repent .
leave me , propn .
my lord , i take my leave .
why did i marry ?
this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more , much more , than he unfolds .
in the meantime , let me be thought too busy in my fears— as worthy cause i have to fear i am— and hold her free , i do beseech your honor .
fear not my government .
i once more take my leave .
this fellow 's of exceeding honesty , and knows all qualities , with a learned spirit , of human dealings .
if i do prove her haggard , though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , propn whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune .
o curse of marriage , that we can call these delicate creatures ours , and not their appetites !
i had rather be a toad , and live upon the vapor of a dungeon , than keep a corner in the thing i love for others ' uses .
yet , ' tis the plague of great ones ; prerogatived are they less than the base ; ' propn destiny unshunnable , like death : even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken .
i 'll not believe't .
how now , my dear othello !
your dinner , and the generous islanders by you invited , do attend your presence .
i am to blame .
why do you speak so faintly ?
are you not well ?
i have a pain upon my forehead here .
come , i 'll go in with you .
i am very sorry that you are not well .
i 'll have the work ta'en out , and give't propn .
what he will do with it propn knows , not i ; i nothing but to please his fantasy .
do not you chide ; i have a thing for you .
a thing for me ?
it is a common thing— ha !
to have a foolish wife .
o , is that all ?
what will you give me now for that same handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
why , that the propn first gave to propn ; that which so often you did bid me steal .
hast stol'n it from her ?
look , here it is .
a good wench ; give it me .
what will you do with't , that you have been so earnest to have me filch it ?
why , what is that to you ?
if't be not for some purpose of import , give't me again .
poor lady , she 'll run mad when she shall lack it .
be not acknown o n't ; i have use for it .
go , leave me .
i will in propn 's lodging lose this napkin , and let him find it .
not poppy , nor mandragora , nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , propn ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday .
why , how now , general !
no more of that .
propn !
be gone !
how now , my lord ?
what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust ?
i am sorry to hear this .
i had been happy if the general camp , propn and all , had tasted her sweet body , so i had nothing known .
o , now forever propn the tranquil mind !
farewell content !
propn the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue !
o , farewell , propn the neighing steed and the shrill trump , the spiritstirring drum , the earpiercing fife , the royal banner , and all quality , propn , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
and o you mortal engines , whose rude throats the immortal propn 's dread clamors counterfeit , propn !
othello 's occupation 's gone !
is't possible , my lord ?
villain , be sure thou prove my love a whore ; be sure of it .
give me the ocular proof ; or , by the worth of man 's eternal soul , thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath !
is't come to this ?
make me to see't ; or at the least so prove it , that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on ; or woe upon thy life !
o grace !
o propn defend me !
are you a man ?
have you a soul or sense ?
propn be wi ' you ; take mine office .
o wretched fool , that livest to make thine honesty a vice !
o monstrous world !
take note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe .
i thank you for this profit , and from hence i 'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense .
i should be wise ; for honesty 's a fool , and loses that it works for .
by the world , i think my wife be honest , and think she is not ; i think that thou art just , and think thou art not .
i 'll have some proof .
her name , that was as fresh as propn 's visage , is now begrimed and black as mine own face .
if there be cords or knives , poison or fire , or suffocating streams , i 'll not endure it .
would i were satisfied !
you would be satisfied ?
would ?
nay , i will .
and may .
but , how ?
how satisfied , my lord ?
death and damnation !
o !
it were a tedious difficulty , i think , to bring them to that prospect .
damn them then , if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own !
what then ?
how then ?
what shall i say ?
where 's satisfaction ?
it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , as salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk .
but yet , i say , if imputation and strong circumstances , which lead directly to the door of truth , will give you satisfaction , you may have't .
give me a living reason she 's disloyal .
i do not like the office ; but sith i am enter 'd in this cause so far , propn propn by foolish honesty and love , i will go on .
i lay with propn lately and , being troubled with a raging tooth , i could not sleep .
nay , this was but his dream .
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly .
i 'll tear her all to pieces .
tell me but this ; have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife 's hand ?
i gave her such a one ; ' twas my first gift .
now do i see ' tis true .
arise , black vengeance , from thy hollow cell !
yield up , o love , thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate !
propn , bosom , with thy fraught , for ' tis of aspics ' tongues !
yet be content .
o , blood , blood , blood !
patience , i say ; your mind perhaps may change .
let him command , and to obey shall be in me remorse , what bloody business ever .
damn her , lewd minx !
o , damn her !
come , go with me apart ; i will withdraw , to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil .
now art thou my lieutenant .
i am your own forever .
do you know , sirrah , where propn propn lies ?
i dare not say he lies anywhere .
why , man ?
he 's a soldier ; and for one to say a soldier lies , is stab- bing .
to tell you where he lodges , is to tell you where i lie .
can anything be made of this ?
i know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging , and say he lies here or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?
i will catechize the world for him ; that is , make ques- tions and by them answer .
seek him , bid him come hither .
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well .
to do this is within the compass of man 's wit , and therefore i will attempt the doing it .
where should i lose that handkerchief , propn ?
i know not , madam .
believe me , i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes ; and , but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are , it were enough to put him to ill thinking .
is he not jealous ?
who , he ?
i think the sun where he was born propn all such humors from him .
look , where he comes .
i will not leave him now till propn propn call 'd to him .
how is't with you , my lord ?
well , my good lady .
o , hardness to dissemble !
how do you , propn ?
well , my good lord .
give me your hand .
this hand is moist , my lady .
this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty , fasting and prayer , much castigation , exercise devout , for here 's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels .
propn a good hand , a frank one .
you may , indeed , say so ; for ' twas that hand that gave away my heart .
a liberal hand .
the hearts of old gave hands ; but our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
i can not speak of this .
come now , your promise .
what promise , chuck ?
i have sent to bid propn come speak with you .
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me ; lend me thy handkerchief .
here , my lord .
that which i gave you .
i have it not about me .
not ?
no , faith , my lord .
that 's a fault .
that handkerchief did an propn to my mother give ; she was a charmer , and could almost read the thoughts of people .
she told her , while she kept it , ' twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love , but if she lost it or made a gift of it , my father 's eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies .
she dying gave it me , and bid me , when my fate would have me wive , to give it her .
is't possible ?
indeed !
is't true ?
most veritable ; therefore look to't well .
then would to propn that i had never see n't !
ha !
wherefore ?
why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
is't lost ?
is't gone ?
speak , is it out o ' the way ?
propn bless us !
say you ?
it is not lost ; but what an if it were ?
how ?
i say , it is not lost .
fetch't , let me see it .
why , so i can , sir , but i will not now .
this is a trick to put me from my suit .
pray you , let propn be received again .
come , come ; you 'll never meet a more sufficient man .
the handkerchief !
a man that all his time propn founded his good fortunes on your love , shared dangers with you— the handkerchief !
in sooth , you are to blame .
away !
is not this man jealous ?
i ne'er saw this before .
sure there 's some wonder in this handkerchief ; i am most unhappy in the loss of it .
go and importune her .
how now , good propn !
what 's the news with you ?
i would not be delay 'd .
alas , thrice gentle propn !
my advocation is not now in tune ; my lord is not my lord , nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor alter 'd .
so help me every spirit sanctified , as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech !
you must awhile be patient .
what i can do i will ; and more i will than for myself i dare .
let that suffice you .
is my lord angry ?
he went hence but now , and certainly in strange unquietness .
can he be angry ?
something of moment then .
i prithee , do so .
something sure of state , either from propn or some unhatch 'd practice made demonstrable here in propn to him , propn puddled his clear spirit ; and in such cases propn 's natures wrangle with inferior things , though great ones are their object .
propn even so ; for let our finger ache , and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain .
nay , we must think men are not gods , i was , unhandsome warrior as i am , arraigning his unkindness with my soul ; but now i find i had suborn 'd the witness , and he 's indicted falsely .
pray propn it be state matters , as you think , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you .
propn the day , i never gave him cause !
but jealous souls will not be answer 'd so ; they are not ever jealous for the cause , but jealous for they are jealous .
propn a monster propn upon itself , born on itself .
propn keep that monster from propn 's mind !
propn , amen .
i will go seek him .
propn , walk hereabout .
if i do find him fit , i 'll move your suit , and seek to effect it to my uttermost .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
save you , friend propn !
what make you from home ?
how is it with you , my most fair propn ?
i'faith , sweet love , i was coming to your house .
seven days and nights ?
eight score eight hours ?
and lovers ' absent hours , more tedious than the dial eight score times ?
o weary reckoning !
o propn , whence came this ?
this is some token from a newer friend .
well , well .
go to , woman !
throw your vile guesses in the devil 's teeth , from whence you have them .
you are jealous now that this is from some mistress , some remembrance : no , by my faith , propn .
why , whose is it ?
i know not , sweet .
i found it in my chamber .
i like the work well .
leave you !
wherefore ?
i do attend here on the general ; and think it no addition , nor my wish , to have him see me woman 'd .
why , i pray you ?
not that i love you not .
but that you do not love me .
i pray you , bring me on the way a little ; and say if i shall see you soon at night .
propn very good ; i must be circumstanced .
will you think so ?
think so , propn ?
what , to kiss in private ?
an unauthorized kiss .
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
naked in bed , propn , and not mean harm !
why , then , ' tis hers , my lord , and being hers , she may , i think , bestow't on any man .
ay , what of that ?
that 's not so good now .
what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ?
he hath , my lord ; but be you well assured , no more than he 'll unswear .
what hath he said ?
faith , that he did — i know not what he did .
what ?
what ?
with her , on her , what you will .
zounds , that 's fulsome !
nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction .
it is not words that shakes me thus .
pish !
noses , ears , and lips .
is't possible ?
confess ? — handkerchief ? — o devil !
work on , my medicine , work !
thus credulous fools are caught : and many worthy and chaste dames even thus , all guiltless , meet reproach .
what , ho !
my lord !
my lord , i say !
othello !
how now , propn !
what 's the matter ?
rub him about the temples .
look , he stirs : do you withdraw yourself a little while , he will recover straight .
when he is gone , i would on great occasion speak with you .
how is it , general ?
have you not hurt your head ?
dost thou mock me ?
i mock you ?
no , by propn .
would you would bear your fortune like a man !
a horned man 's a monster and a beast .
there 's many a beast then in a populous city , and many a civil monster .
did he confess it ?
good sir , be a man ; think every bearded fellow that 's but yoked may draw with you .
there 's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar .
your case is better .
o , ' tis the spite of hell , the fiend 's archmock , to lip a wanton in a secure couch , and to suppose her chaste !
no , let me know ; and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be .
o , thou art wise ; ' tis certain .
stand you awhile apart ; confine yourself but in a patient list .
whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief— a passion most unsuiting such a man— propn came hither .
i shifted him away , and laid good ‘ scuse upon your ecstasy ; bade him anon return and here speak with me ; the which he promised .
do but encave yourself , and mark the fleers , the gibes , and notable scorns , that dwell in every region of his face ; for i will make him tell the tale anew , where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when he hath and is again to cope your wife : i say , but mark his gesture .
marry , patience , or i shall say you are all in all in spleen , and nothing of a man .
dost thou hear , propn ?
that 's not amiss ; but yet keep time in all .
will you withdraw ?
now will i question propn of propn , a housewife that by selling her desires propn herself bread and clothes .
it is a creature that dotes on propn , as ' tis the strumpet 's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one .
he , when he hears of her , can not refrain from the excess of laughter .
here he comes .
as he shall smile , propn shall go mad ; and his unbookish jealousy must construe propn propn 's smiles , gestures , and light behavior , quite in the wrong .
how do you now , lieutenant ?
the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me .
propn propn well , and you are sure o n't .
now , if this suit lay in propn 's power , how quickly should you speed !
alas , poor caitiff !
look , how he laughs already !
i never knew a woman love man so .
alas , poor rogue !
i think , i'faith , she loves me .
now he denies it faintly and laughs it out .
do you hear , propn ?
now he importunes him to tell it o'er .
go to ; well said , well said .
ha , ha , ha !
do you triumph , roman ?
do you triumph ?
i marry her !
what ?
a customer !
i prithee , bear some charity to my wit ; do not think it so unwholesome .
ha , ha , ha !
so , so , so , so .
they laugh that win .
faith , the cry goes that you shall marry her .
prithee , say true .
i am a very villain else .
have you scored me ?
well .
this is the monkey 's own giving out .
she is persuaded i will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .
iago beckons me ; now he begins the story .
she was here even now ; she haunts me in every place .
so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me ; so hales and pulls me .
ha , ha , ha !
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
o , i see that nose of yours , but not that dog i shall throw it to .
well , i must leave her company .
before me !
look where she comes .
propn such another fitchew !
marry , a perfumed one .
what do you mean by this haunting of me ?
let the devil and his dam haunt you !
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
i was a fine fool to take it .
i must take out the work ?
a likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there !
this is some minx 's token , and i must take out the work ?
there , give it your hobby - horse .
wheresoever you had it , i 'll take out no work o n't .
how now , my sweet propn !
how now !
how now !
by propn , that should be my handkerchief !
an you 'll come to supper tonight , you may ; an you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
after her , after her .
faith , i must ; she 'll rail i ' the street else .
will you sup there ?
faith , i intend so .
well , i may chance to see you , for i would very fain speak with you .
prithee , come ; will you ?
go to ; say no more .
how shall i murder him , propn ?
did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
o iago !
and did you see the handkerchief ?
was that mine ?
yours , by this hand .
and to see how he prizes the fool- ish woman your wife !
she gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
i would have him nine years akilling .
a fine woman !
a fair woman !
a sweet woman !
nay , you must forget that .
ay , let her rot , and perish , and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .
no , my heart is turned to stone ; i strike it , and it hurts my hand .
o , the world hath not a sweeter creature .
she might lie by an emperor 's side , and command him tasks .
nay , that 's not your way .
hang her !
i do but say what she is .
o , she will sing the savageness out of a bear .
of so high and plenteous wit and invention !
she 's the worse for all this .
o , a thousand , a thousand times .
and then , of so gentle a condition !
ay , too gentle .
nay , that 's certain .
but yet the pity of it , propn !
o propn , the pity of it , propn !
if you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for , if it touch not you , it comes near nobody .
i will chop her into messes .
propn me !
o , ' tis foul in her .
with mine officer !
that 's fouler .
get me some poison , propn , this night .
i 'll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again .
and for propn , let me be his undertaker .
you shall hear more by midnight .
excellent good .
a trumpet without .
what trumpet is that same ?
something from propn , sure .
propn propn come from the propn .
and , see your wife is with him .
propn save the worthy general !
with all my heart , sir .
the propn and propn of propn greet you .
i kiss the instrument of their pleasures .
and what 's the news , good cousin propn ?
i am very glad to see you , signior ; welcome to propn .
i thank you .
how does propn propn ?
lives , sir .
propn , there 's fall'n between him and my lord an unkind breech ; but you shall make all well .
are you sure of that ?
my lord ?
is there division ' twixt my lord and propn ?
a most unhappy one .
i would do much to atone them , for the love i bear to propn .
fire and brimstone !
my lord ?
are you wise ?
what , is he angry ?
may be the letter moved him ; for , as i think , they do command him home , propn propn in his government .
by my troth , i am glad o n't .
indeed !
my lord ?
i am glad to see you mad .
i have not deserved this .
my lord , this would not be believed in propn , propn i should swear i saw't .
o devil , devil !
if that the earth could teem with woman 's tears , each drop she falls would prove a crocodile .
out of my sight !
i will not stay to offend you .
propn !
my lord ?
what would you with her , sir ?
who , i , my lord ?
proceed you in your tears .
concerning this , sir — propn well - painted passion ! — i am commanded home .
get you away ; i 'll send for you anon .
propn , i obey the mandate , and will return to propn .
hence , avaunt !
propn shall have my place .
and , sir , tonight , i do entreat that we may sup together .
you are welcome , sir , to propn .
goats and monkeys !
is this the noble propn whom our full propn propn all in all sufficient ?
this the nature propn passion could not shake ?
whose solid virtue the shot of accident nor dart of chance could neither graze nor pierce ?
he is much changed .
are his wits safe ?
is he not light of brain ?
he 's that he is .
what , strike his wife !
faith , that was not so well ; yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst !
is it his use ?
or did the letters work upon his blood , and new create this fault ?
alas , alas !
it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known .
i am sorry that i am deceived in him .
you have seen nothing , then ?
nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
yes , you have seen propn and she together .
but then i saw no harm , and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them .
what , did they never whisper ?
never , my lord .
nor send you out o ' the way ?
never .
to fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
never , my lord .
that 's strange .
i durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , propn down my soul at stake .
if any wretch have put this in your head , let propn requite it with the serpent 's curse !
for if she be not honest , chaste , and true , there 's no man happy ; the purest of their wives is foul as slander .
she says enough ; yet she 's a simple bawd that can not say as much .
my lord , what is your will ?
pray , chuck , come hither .
what is your pleasure ?
let me see your eyes ; look in my face .
what horrible fancy 's this ?
upon my knees , what doth your speech import ?
i understand a fury in your words , but not the words .
why , what art thou ?
your wife , my lord , your true and loyal wife .
come , swear it , damn thyself ; propn , being like one of propn , the devils themselves should fear to seize thee .
therefore be doubledamn 'd ; propn thou art honest .
heaven doth truly know it .
propn truly knows that thou art false as hell .
to whom , my lord ?
with whom ?
how am i false ?
o propn !
away !
away !
away !
alas the heavy day !
why do you weep ?
am i the motive of these tears , my lord ?
if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back , propn not your blame on me .
if you have lost him : why , i have lost him too .
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in !
turn thy complexion there , patience , thou young and roselipp 'd cherubin , ay , there , look grim as hell !
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
o , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , that quicken even with blowing .
o thou weed , who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born !
alas , what ignorant sin have i committed ?
was this fair paper , this most goodly book , made to write “ whore ” upon ?
what committed ?
committed !
o thou public commoner !
i should make very forges of my cheeks , that would to cinders burn up modesty , did i but speak thy deeds .
what committed !
propn stops the nose at it , and the moon winks ; the bawdy wind , that kisses all it meets , is hush 'd within the hollow mine of earth , and will not hear it .
what committed .
impudent strumpet !
by propn , you do me wrong .
are not you a strumpet ?
no , as i am a propn .
if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet , i am none .
what , not a whore ?
no , as i shall be saved .
is't possible ?
o , propn forgive us !
you , mistress , that have the office opposite to propn propn , and keep the gate of hell !
you , you , ay , you !
alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
how do you , madam ?
how do you , my good lady ?
faith , half asleep .
good madam , what 's the matter with my lord ?
with who ?
why , with my lord , madam .
who is thy lord ?
he that is yours , sweet lady .
i have none .
do not talk to me , propn ; i can not weep , nor answer have i none but what should go by water .
prithee , tonight propn on my bed my wedding sheets .
remember ; and call thy husband hither .
here 's a change indeed !
propn meet i should be used so , very meet .
how have i been behaved , that he might stick the small'st opinion on my least misuse ?
what is your pleasure , madam ?
how is't with you ?
i can not tell .
what 's the matter , lady ?
alas , propn , my lord hath so bewhored her , propn such despite and heavy terms upon her , as true hearts can not bear .
am i that name , propn ?
what name , fair lady ?
such as she says my lord did say i was .
why did he so ?
i do not know ; i am sure i am none such .
do not weep , do not weep .
propn the day !
propn she forsook so many noble matches , her father and her country and her friends , to be call 'd whore ?
would it not make one weep ?
it is my wretched fortune .
how comes this trick upon him ?
nay , propn doth know .
i will be hang 'd , if some eternal villain , some busy and insinuating rogue , some cogging cozening slave , to get some office , have not devised this slander ; i 'll be hang 'd else .
propn , there is no such man ; it is impossible .
if any such there be , propn pardon him !
a halter pardon him !
and hell gnaw his bones !
why should he call her whore ?
who keeps her company ?
what place ?
what time ?
what form ?
what likelihood ?
the propn 's abused by some most villainous knave , some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
o propn , that such companions thou'ldst unfold , and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west !
speak within door .
o , fie upon them !
some such squire he was that turn 'd your wit the seamy side without , and made you to suspect me with the propn .
you are a fool ; go to .
o good propn , what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friend , go to him , for by this light of propn , i know not how i lost him .
unkindness may do much , and his unkindness may defeat my life , but never taint my love .
if ' twere no other— ' propn but so , i warrant .
propn , how these instruments summon to supper !
how now , propn !
i do not find that thou dealest justly with me .
what in the contrary ?
every day thou daffest me with some device , propn ; and rather , as it seems to me now , keepest from me all conve- niency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope .
will you hear me , propn ?
faith , i have heard too much , for your words and per- formances are no kin together .
you charge me most unjustly .
with nought but truth .
i have wasted myself out of my means .
the jewels you have had from me to deliver to propn would half have corrupted a votarist .
well , go to , very well .
very well !
go to !
i can not go to , man ; nor ' tis not very well .
by this hand , i say ' tis very scurvy , and begin to find myself fopped in it .
very well .
i tell you ' tis not very well .
you have said now .
ay , and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing .
why , now i see there 's mettle in thee ; and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before .
give me thy hand , propn .
thou hast taken against me a most just exception ; but yet , i protest , have dealt most directly in thy affair .
it hath not appeared .
i grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement .
well , what is it ?
is it within reason and compass ?
propn , there is especial commission come from propn to depute propn in propn 's place .
is that true ?
why , then propn and propn return again to propn .
o , no ; he goes into propn , and takes away with him the fair propn , unless his abode be lingered here by some accident ; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of propn .
how do you mean , removing of him ?
why , by making him uncapable of propn 's place ; knocking out his brains .
and that you would have me to do ?
ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right .
he sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will i go to him .
he knows not yet of his honorable fortune .
come , stand not amazed at it , but go along with me ; i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .
it is now high sup- pertime , and the night grows to waste .
about it .
i will hear further reason for this .
and you shall be satisfied .
i do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
o , pardon me ; ‘ twill do me good to walk .
propn , good night ; i humbly thank your ladyship .
your honor is most welcome .
will you walk , sir ?
o — desdemona— my lord ?
i will , my lord .
how goes it now ?
he looks gentler than he did .
dismiss me ?
it was his bidding ; therefore , good propn , give me my nightly wearing , and adieu .
we must not now displease him .
i would you had never seen him !
so would not i .
my love doth so approve him , that even his stubbornness , his checks , his propn propn , unpin me — have grace and favor in them .
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
all 's one .
good faith , how foolish are our minds !
if i do die before thee , prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets .
come , come , you talk .
my mother had a maid call 'd propn ; she was in love , and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her .
she had a song of “ willow ” ; an old thing ' twas , but it express 'd her fortune , and she died singing it .
prithee , dispatch .
shall i go fetch your nightgown ?
no , unpin me here .
this propn is a proper man .
a very handsome man .
he speaks well .
i know a lady in propn would have walked barefoot to propn for a touch of his nether lip .
the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree , sing all a green willow ; her hand on her bosom , her head on her knee , sing willow , willow , willow .
it 's the wind .
i call 'd my love false love ; but what said he then ?
mine eyes do itch ; doth that bode weeping ?
propn neither here nor there .
i have heard it said so .
o , these men , these men !
dost thou in conscience think — tell me , emilia— that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind ?
there be some such , no question .
propn thou do such a deed for all the world ?
why , would not you ?
no , by this heavenly light !
nor i neither by this heavenly light ; i might do't as well i ' the dark .
propn thou do such a thing for all the world ?
the world 's a huge thing ; it is a great price for a final vice .
in troth , i think thou wouldst not .
in troth , i think i should , and undo't when i had done .
marry , i would not do such a thing for a jointring , nor for measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition ; but , for the whole world why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ?
i should venture purgatory for't .
beshrew me , if i would do such a wrong for the whole world .
why , the wrong is but a wrong i ' the world ; and hav- ing the world for your labor , ' tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
i do not think there is any such woman .
yes , a dozen , and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for .
what is it that they do when they change us for others ?
is it sport ?
i think it doth .
is't frailty that thus errs ?
it is so too .
and have not we affections , desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
good night , good night .
propn me such uses send , not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !
quick , quick ; fear nothing ; i 'll be at thy elbow .
it makes us , or it mars us ; think on that , and fix most firm thy resolution .
be near at hand ; i may miscarry propn .
forth , my sword ; he dies .
i have rubb 'd this young quat almost to the sense , and he grows angry .
now , whether he kill propn , or propn him , or each do kill the other , every way makes my gain .
live propn , he calls me to a restitution large of gold and jewels that i bobb 'd from him , as gifts to propn ; it must not be .
if propn do remain , he hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly ; and besides , the propn may unfold me to him ; there stand i in much peril : no , he must die .
i know his gait ; ' tis he .
villain , thou diest !
o , i am slain !
i am maim 'd forever .
help , ho !
murder !
murder !
o , villain that i am !
it is even so .
o , help , ho !
light !
a surgeon !
propn he .
o brave propn , honest and just , that hast such noble sense of thy friend 's wrong !
propn , i come !
forth of my heart those charms , thine eyes , are blotted ; propn bed , lust - propn shall with lust 's blood be spotted .
what , ho !
no watch ?
no passage ?
murder !
murder !
propn some mischance ; the cry is very direful .
o , help !
propn !
o wretched villain !
nobody come ?
then shall i bleed to death .
propn !
here 's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
who 's there ?
did not you hear a cry ?
here , here !
for propn 's sake , help me !
what 's the matter ?
this is propn 's ancient , as i take it .
the same indeed ; a very valiant fellow .
what are you here that cry so grievously ?
iago ?
o , i am spoil 'd , undone by villains !
give me some help .
o me , lieutenant !
what villains have done this ?
i think that one of them is hereabout , and can not make away .
o treacherous villains !
what are you there ?
come in and give some help .
o , help me here !
that 's one of them .
o murderous slave !
o villain !
o damn 'd propn !
o inhuman dog !
kill men i ' the dark !
where be these bloody thieves ?
how silent is this town !
ho !
murder !
murder !
what may you be ?
are you of good or evil ?
as you shall prove us , praise us .
propn propn ?
he , sir .
i cry you mercy .
here 's propn hurt by villains .
propn ?
how is't , brother ?
my leg is cut in two .
propn , propn forbid !
what is the matter , ho ?
who is't that cried ?
who is't that cried !
o my dear propn , my sweet propn !
o propn , propn , propn !
o notable strumpet !
propn , may you suspect who they should be that have thus mangled you ?
no .
lend me a garter .
so .
o , for a chair , to bear him easily hence !
alas , he faints !
o propn , propn , propn !
gentlemen all , i do suspect this trash to be a party in this injury .
patience awhile , good propn .
come , come ; lend me a light .
know we this face or no ?
alas , my friend and my dear countryman propn ?
no — yes , sure .
o heaven !
propn .
what , of propn ?
even he , sir .
did you know him ?
know him !
ay .
propn propn ?
i cry you gentle pardon ; these bloody accidents must excuse my manners , that so neglected you .
o , a chair , a chair !
propn !
he , he , ’ tis he .
some good man bear him carefully from hence ; i 'll fetch the general 's surgeon .
for you , mistress , save you your labor .
none in the world ; nor do i know the man .
what , look you pale ?
o , bear him out o ' the air .
stay you , good gentlemen .
look you pale , mistress ?
do you perceive the gastness of her eye ?
nay , if you stare , we shall hear more anon .
behold her well ; i pray you , look upon her .
do you see , gentlemen ?
nay , guiltiness will speak , propn tongues were out of use .
propn , what 's the matter ?
what 's the matter , husband ?
alas , good gentleman !
alas , good propn !
this is the fruit of whoring .
prithee , propn , go know of propn where he supp 'd tonight .
what , do you shake at that ?
he supp 'd at my house ; but i therefore shake not .
o , did he so ?
i charge you , go with me .
propn , fie upon thee , strumpet !
i am no strumpet , but of life as honest as you that thus abuse me .
as i !
foh !
fie upon thee !
kind gentlemen , let 's go see poor propn dress 'd .
come , mistress , you must tell 's another tale .
emilia , run you to the citadel , and tell my lord and lady what hath happ 'd !
will you go on ?
aside .
this is the night that either makes me or fordoes me quite .
it is the cause .
yet i 'll not shed her blood , nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster .
yet she must die , else she 'll betray more men .
put out the light , and then put out the light .
o , balmy breath , that dost almost persuade propn to break her sword !
one more , one more ; be thus when thou art dead , and i will kill thee , and love thee after .
one more , and this the last : so sweet was ne'er so fatal .
she wakes .
who 's there ?
othello ?
ay , propn .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
have you pray 'd tonight , propn ?
ay , my lord .
if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace , propn for it straight .
alas , my lord , what may you mean by that ?
i would not kill thy soul .
talk you of killing ?
ay , i do .
then propn have mercy on me !
amen , with all my heart !
if you say so , i hope you will not kill me .
hum !
and yet i fear you , for you are fatal then when your eyes roll so .
why i should fear i know not , since guiltiness i know not ; but yet i feel i fear .
think on thy sins .
they are loves i bear to you .
ay , and for that thou diest .
that death 's unnatural that kills for loving .
alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
peace , and be still !
i will so .
what 's the matter ?
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee thou gavest to propn .
no , by my life and soul !
send for the man , and ask him .
sweet soul , take heed , take heed of perjury ; thou are on thy deathbed .
ay , but not yet to die .
thou art to die .
then propn have mercy on me !
i say , amen .
and have you mercy too !
i never did offend you in my life ; never loved propn but with such general warranty of propn as i might love .
i never gave him token .
by propn , i saw my handkerchief in ‘ s hand .
o perjured woman !
he found it then ; i never gave it him .
he hath confess 'd .
what , my lord ?
that he hath used thee .
how ?
unlawfully ?
ay .
he will not say so .
no , his mouth is stopp 'd ; propn propn hath ta'en order for't .
o , my fear interprets !
what , is he dead ?
had all his hairs been lives , my great revenge had stomach for them all .
alas , he is betray 'd , and i undone !
out , strumpet !
weep'st thou for him to my face ?
o , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
down , strumpet !
kill me tomorrow ; let me live tonight !
nay , if you strive— but half an hour !
being done , there is no pause .
but while i say one prayer !
it is too late .
my lord , my lord !
what , ho !
my lord , my lord !
what noise is this ?
not dead ?
not yet quite dead ?
i that am cruel am yet merciful ; i would not have thee linger in thy pain .
so , so .
what , ho !
my lord , my lord !
who 's there ?
o , good my lord , i would speak a word with you !
by and by .
she 's dead .
ha !
no more moving ?
still as the grave .
shall she come in ?
were't good ?
i think she stirs again .
no .
what 's best to do ?
if she come in , she 'll sure speak to my wife .
my wife !
my wife !
what wife ?
i have no wife .
o , insupportable !
o heavy hour !
methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon , and that the affrighted globe should yawn at alteration .
i do beseech you that i may speak with you , o , good my lord !
i had forgot thee .
o , come in , propn .
soft , by and by .
let me the curtains draw .
where art thou ?
what 's the matter with thee now ?
o , my good lord , yonder 's foul murders done !
what , now ?
but now , my lord .
it is the very error of the moon ; she comes more nearer earth than she was wo nt and makes men mad .
propn , my lord , hath kill 'd a young venetian propn propn .
propn propn ?
and propn propn ?
no , propn is not kill 'd .
not propn propn !
then murder 's out of tune , and sweet revenge grows harsh .
o , falsely , falsely murdered !
alas , what cry is that ?
that ?
what ?
out , and alas !
that was my lady 's voice .
help !
help , ho !
help !
o lady , speak again !
propn propn !
o sweet mistress , speak !
a guiltless death i die .
o , who hath done this deed ?
nobody ; i myself .
o , farewell !
why , how should she be murdered ?
alas , who knows ?
you heard her say herself , it was not i .
o , the more angel she , and you the blacker devil !
she turn 'd to folly , and she was a whore .
thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
she was false as water .
thou art rash as fire , to say that she was false .
o , she was heavenly true !
propn did top her ; ask thy husband else .
o , i were damn 'd beneath all depth in hell , but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity .
propn husband knew it all .
my husband !
propn husband .
that she was false to wedlock ?
ay , with propn .
nay , had she been true , if propn would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite , propn not have sold her for it .
my husband !
my husband ?
what needs this iteration , woman ?
i say thy husband .
o mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love !
my husband say that she was false !
he , woman ; i say thy husband .
dost understand the word ?
my friend , thy husband , honest , honest iago .
if he say so , may his pernicious soul propn half a grain a day !
he lies to the heart .
she was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
ha !
peace , you were best .
thou hast not half that power to do me harm as i have to be hurt .
o gull !
o dolt !
as ignorant as dirt !
thou hast done a deed— i care not for thy sword ; i 'll make thee known , though i lost twenty lives .
help !
help , ho !
help !
the propn hath kill 'd my mistress !
murder , murder !
what is the matter ?
how now , general ?
o , are you come , propn ?
you have done well , that men must lay their murders on your neck .
what is the matter ?
speak , for my heart is full .
i told him what i thought , and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true .
but did you ever tell him she was false ?
i did .
you told a lie , an odious , damned lie ; upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie !
she false with propn ?
did you say with propn ?
with propn , mistress .
go to , charm your tongue .
i will not charm my tongue ; i am bound to speak .
my mistress here lies murdered in her bed .
o heavens forfend !
and your reports have set the murder on .
propn a strange truth .
o monstrous act !
villainy , villainy , villainy !
i think upo n't , i think , i smell't , o villainy !
what , are you mad ?
i charge you , get you home .
perchance , propn , i will ne'er go home .
o !
o !
o !
nay , lay thee down and roar ; for thou hast propn the sweetest innocent that e'er did lift up eye .
o , she was foul !
i scarce did know you , uncle ; there lies your niece , whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp 'd .
i know this act shows horrible and grim .
propn propn !
i saw it in his hand : it was a handkerchief , an antique token my father gave my mother .
o heaven !
o heavenly powers !
hold your peace .
twill out , ' twill .
i peace !
be wise , and get you home .
i will not .
fie !
your sword upon a woman ?
o thou dull propn !
that handkerchief thou speak'st of i found by fortune and did give my husband ; for often with a solemn earnestness , more than indeed belong 'd to such a trifle , he begg 'd of me to steal it .
villainous whore !
she give it propn ?
no , alas , i found it , and i did give't my husband .
propn , thou liest !
by propn , i do not , i do not , gentlemen .
o murderous coxcomb !
what should such a fool do with so good a wife ?
are there not stones in propn but what serve for thunder ?
precious villain !
the woman falls ; sure , he hath kill 'd his wife .
ay , ay !
o , lay me by my mistress ’ side .
he 's gone , but his wife 's kill 'd .
propn a notorious villain .
i 'll after that same villain , for ' tis a damned slave .
i am not valiant neither , but every puny whipster gets my sword .
but why should honor outlive honesty ?
let it go all .
what did thy song bode , lady ?
propn , canst thou hear me ?
i will play the swan , and die in music .
sings .
propn , she was chaste ; she loved thee , cruel propn ; so come my soul to bliss , as i speak true ; so speaking as i think , i die , i die .
propn , i must come forth .
if thou attempt it , it will cost thee dear : thou hast no weapon , and perforce must suffer .
look in upon me then , and speak with me , or , naked as i am , i will assault thee .
what is the matter ?
propn , i have a weapon ; a better never did itself sustain upon a soldier 's thigh .
i have seen the day that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop .
but , o vain boast !
who can control his fate ?
propn not so now .
be not afraid , though you do see me weapon 'd ; here is my journey 's end , here is my butt and very seamark of my utmost sail .
do you go back dismay 'd ?
propn a lost fear : man but a rush against propn 's breast , and he retires .
where should propn go ?
now , how dost thou look now ?
o ill - starr 'd wench !
pale as thy smock !
when we shall meet at compt , this look of thine will hurl my soul from propn , and fiends will snatch at it .
o cursed , cursed slave !
whip me , ye devils , from the possession of this heavenly sight !
blow me about in winds !
roast me in sulphur !
wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire !
o propn !
dead , propn !
dead !
where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?
where is that viper ?
bring the villain forth .
i look down towards his feet ; but that 's a fable .
if that thou be'st a devil , i can not kill thee .
wrench his sword from him .
i bleed , sir , but not kill 'd .
i am not sorry neither .
i'ld have thee live , for , in my sense , ' tis happiness to die .
o thou othello , that wert once so good , what shall be said to thee ?
why , anything ; an honorable murderer , if you will , for nought did i in hate , but all in honor .
this wretch hath part confess 'd his villainy .
did you and he consent in propn 's death ?
ay .
dear general , i never gave you cause .
i do believe it , and i ask your pardon .
will you , i pray , demand that demidevil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
from this time forth i never will speak word .
what , not to pray ?
torments will ope your lips .
well , thou dost best .
propn , you shall understand what hath befall'n , which , as i think , you know not .
here is a letter found in the pocket of the slain propn , and here another .
the one of them imports the death of propn to be undertook by propn .
o villain !
most heathenish and most gross !
now here 's another discontented paper , found in his pocket too ; and this , it seems , propn meant to have sent this damned villain ; but that , belike , propn in the interim came in and satisfied him .
o the pernicious caitiff !
how came you , propn , by that handkerchief that was my wife 's ?
i found it in my chamber ; and he himself confess 'd but even now that there he dropp 'd it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire .
o fool !
fool !
fool !
for this slave , if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long , it shall be his .
you shall close prisoner rest , till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state .
come , bring away .
soft you ; a word or two before you go .
i have done the state some service , and they know't .
no more of that .
i pray you , in your letters , when you shall these unlucky deeds relate , speak of me as i am ; nothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice .
then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well ; of one not easily jealous , but , being wrought , perplex 'd in the extreme ; of one whose hand , like the base propn , threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe ; of one whose subdued eyes , propn unused to the melting mood , propn tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gum .
set you down this ; and say besides , that in propn once , where a malignant and a turban 'd propn beat a propn and traduced the state , i took by the throat the circumcised dog and smote him , thus .
o bloody period !
all that 's spoke is marr 'd .
i kiss 'd thee ere i kill 'd thee .
no way but this , killing myself , to die upon a kiss .
this did i fear , but thought he had no weapon ; for he was great of heart .
o spartan dog , more fell than anguish , hunger , or the sea !
look on the tragic loading of this bed ; this is thy work .
the object poisons sight ; let it be hid .
propn , keep the house , and seize upon the fortunes of the propn , for they succeed on you .
myself will straight aboard , and to the state this heavy act with heavy heart relate .
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie , and young affection gapes to be his heir ; that fair for which love groan 'd for and would die , with tender juliet match 'd , is now not fair .
now propn is belov 'd , and loves again , propn bewitched by the charm of looks ; but to his foe suppos 'd he must complain , and she steal love 's sweet bait from fearful hooks .
gregory , on my word , we 'll not carry coals .
no , for then we should be colliers .
i mean , an we be in choler , we 'll draw .
ay , while you live , draw your neck out of the collar .
i strike quickly , being moved .
but thou art not quickly moved to strike .
a dog of the house of propn moves me .
propn all one .
when i have fought with the men , i will be civil with the maids ; i will cut off their heads .
ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
take it in what sense thou wilt .
propn well thou art not fish ; if thou hadst , thou hadst been poor - propn .
my naked weapon is out .
how ?
turn thy back and run ?
fear me not .
no , marry .
i fear thee !
let us take the law of our sides ; let them begin .
i will frown as i pass by , and let them take it as they list .
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
i do bite my thumb , sir .
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
no , sir , i do not bite my thumb at you , sir ; but i bite my thumb , sir .
do you quarrel , sir ?
propn , sir ?
no , sir .
but if you do , sir , i am for you .
i serve as good a man as you .
no better .
well , sir .
say ‘ better. ’ here comes one of my master 's kinsmen .
yes , better , sir .
you lie .
you know not what you do .
what , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
i do but keep the peace .
put up thy sword , or manage it to part these men with me .
have at thee , coward !
clubs , bills , and partisans !
strike !
beat them down !
down with the capulets !
down with the montagues !
what noise is this ?
give me my long sword , ho !
a crutch , a crutch !
why call you for a sword ?
my sword , i say !
propn propn is come and flourishes his blade in spite of me .
thou villain capulet ! —hold me not , let me go .
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
rebellious subjects , enemies to peace , profaners of this neighbour - stained steel— propn they not hear ?
three civil brawls , bred of an airy word by thee , old propn , and propn , have thrice disturb 'd the quiet of our streets and made propn 's ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partisans , in hands as old , canker ’ d with peace , to part your canker 'd hate .
if ever you disturb our streets again , your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace .
once more , on pain of death , all men depart .
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach ?
speak , nephew , were you by when it began ?
here were the servants of your adversary and yours , close fighting ere i did approach .
o , where is propn ?
saw you him to - day ?
right glad i am he was not at this fray .
i , measuring his affections by my own , which then most sought where most might not be found , being one too many by my weary self— pursu 'd my humour , not pursuing his , and gladly shunn 'd who gladly fled from me .
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
i neither know it nor can learn of him .
have you importun 'd him by any means ?
both by myself and many other friends ; but he , his own affections ’ counsellor , is to himself — i will not say how true— but to himself so secret and so close , so far from sounding and discovery , as is the bud bit with an envious worm propn he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun .
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift .
come , madam , let 's away , good morrow , cousin .
is the day so young ?
but new struck nine .
ay me !
sad hours seem long .
was that my father that went hence so fast ?
it was .
what sadness lengthens propn 's hours ?
not having that , which , having , makes them short .
in love ?
propn of love ?
out of her favour , where i am in love .
alas that love , so gentle in his view , should be so tyrannous and rough in proof !
alas that love , whose view is muffled still , should without eyes see pathways to his will !
where shall we dine ?
o me !
what fray was here ?
yet tell me not , for i have heard it all .
o loving hate !
o any thing , of nothing first create !
o heavy lightness !
serious vanity !
misshapen chaos of well - seeming forms !
feather of lead , bright smoke , cold fire , sick health !
this love feel i , that feel no love in this .
dost thou not laugh ?
no , coz , i rather weep .
good heart , at what ?
at thy good heart 's oppression .
why , such is love 's transgression .
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast , which thou wilt propagate , to have it prest with more of thine .
this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own .
love is a smoke rais 'd with the fume of sighs ; being purg 'd , a fire sparkling in lovers ’ eyes ; being vex 'd , a sea nourish 'd with lovers ’ tears .
what is it else ?
a madness most discreet , a choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
propn , my coz .
soft !
i will go along .
an if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
tut !
tell me in sadness , who is that you love ?
what , shall i groan and tell thee ?
propn ?
why , no ; but sadly tell me who .
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
i aim 'd so near when i suppos 'd you lov 'd .
a right good markman !
and she 's fair i love .
a right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
well , in that hit you miss .
she will not stay the siege of loving terms , nor bide propn encounter of assailing eyes , nor ope her lap to saint - seducing gold .
o , she 's rich in beauty ; only poor that , when she dies , with beauty dies her store .
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?
she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste ; for beauty , starv 'd with her severity , propn beauty off from all posterity .
she is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , to merit bliss by making me despair .
she hath forsworn to love , and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now .
be rul 'd by me : forget to think of her .
o , teach me how i should forget to think !
propn the way to call hers , exquisite , in question more .
show me a mistress that is passing fair , what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass 'd that passing fair ?
propn .
thou canst not teach me to forget .
i 'll pay that doctrine , or else die in debt .
but propn is bound as well as i , in penalty alike ; and ' tis not hard , i think , for men so old as we to keep the peace .
of honourable reckoning are you both , and pity ' tis you liv 'd at odds so long .
but now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
younger than she are happy mothers made .
and too soon marr 'd are those so early made .
the earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she ; she is the hopeful lady of my earth .
but woo her , gentle propn , get her heart ; my will to her consent is but a part .
this night i hold an old accustom 'd feast , propn i have invited many a guest , such as i love ; and you among the store , one more , most welcome , makes my number more .
at my poor house look to behold this night propn - treading stars that make dark propn light .
such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well - apparell 'd propn on the heel of limping propn treads , even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night propn at my house .
hear all , all see , and like her most whose merit most shall be ; which , amongst view of many , mine , being one , may stand in number , though in reck'ning none .
come , go with me .
it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil , and the painter with his nets ; but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .
i must to the learned .
in good time !
take thou some new infection to thy eye , and the rank poison of the old will die .
your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
for what , i pray thee ?
for your broken shin .
why , propn , art thou mad ?
not mad , but bound more than a madman is ; shut up in propn , kept without my food , propn and tormented and– propn - propn , good fellow .
i pray , sir , can you read ?
ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
perhaps you have learned it without book .
but i pray , can you read any thing you see ?
ay , if i know the letters and the language .
ye say honestly .
rest you merry !
stay , fellow ; i can read .
propn should they come ?
up .
whither to supper ?
to our house .
whose house ?
my master 's .
indeed , i should have ask 'd you that before .
now i 'll tell you without asking .
my master is the great rich propn ; and if you be not of the house of propn , i pray , come and crush a cup of wine .
rest you merry !
at this same ancient feast of propn 's propn the fair propn whom thou so lov'st ; with all the admired beauties of propn .
go thither , and with unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show , and i will make thee think thy swan a crow .
one fairer than my love ?
the all - seeing sun propn saw her match since first the world begun .
i 'll go along , no such sight to be shown , but to rejoice in splendour of my own .
propn , where 's my daughter ?
call her forth to me .
now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old , i bade her come .
what , lamb !
what ladybird !
propn forbid !
where 's this girl ?
what , propn !
your mother .
propn , i am here .
what is your will ?
this is the matter — nurse , give leave awhile , we must talk in secret .
nurse , come back again ; i have remember 'd me , thou shalt hear our counsel .
thou knowest my daughter 's of a pretty age .
faith , i can tell her age unto an hour .
she 's not fourteen .
i 'll lay fourteen of my teeth— and yet , to my teen be it spoken , i have but four— she is not fourteen .
how long is it now to propn ?
a fortnight and odd days .
even or odd , of all days in the year , come propn propn at night shall she be fourteen .
propn and she ( propn rest all christian souls !
were of an age .
well , propn is with propn ; she was too good for me .
but , as i said , on propn propn at night shall she be fourteen ; that shall she , marry ; i remember it well .
propn since the earthquake now eleven years ; and she was wean 'd ( i never shall forget it ) , of all the days of the year , upon that day ; for i had then laid wormwood to my dug , sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .
nay , i do bear a brain .
propn was a merry man ) took up the child .
yea , ’ quoth he , ‘ dost thou fall upon thy face ?
i warrant , an i should live a thousand years , i never should forget it .
yea , ’ quoth my husband , ‘ fall'st upon thy face ?
peace , i have done .
propn mark thee to his grace !
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nurs 'd .
an i might live to see thee married once , i have my wish .
marry , that ‘ marry ’ is the very theme i came to talk of .
tell me , daughter propn , how stands your disposition to be married ?
it is an honour that i dream not of .
well , think of marriage now .
younger than you , here in propn , ladies of esteem , are made already mothers .
by my count , i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid .
thus then in brief : the valiant propn seeks you for his love .
a man , young lady !
lady , such a man as all the world- why he 's a man of wax .
propn 's summer hath not such a flower .
nay , he 's a flower , in faith — a very flower .
what say you ?
can you love the gentleman ?
the fish lives in the sea , and ' tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide .
that book in many 's eyes doth share the glory , that in gold clasps locks in the golden story ; so shall you share all that he doth possess , by having him making yourself no less .
no less ?
nay , bigger !
women grow by men .
speak briefly , can you like of propn love ?
i 'll look to like , if looking liking move ; but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
propn , the guests are come , supper serv 'd up , you call 'd , my young lady ask 'd for , the nurse curs 'd in the pantry , and everything in extremity .
we follow thee .
propn , the propn stays .
go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
what , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
or shall we on without apology ?
the date is out of such prolixity .
nay , gentle propn , we must have you dance .
not i , believe me .
you have dancing shoes with nimble soles ; i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i can not move .
you are a lover .
borrow propn 's wings and soar with them above a common bound .
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers ; and so bound i can not bound a pitch above dull woe .
under love 's heavy burden do i sink .
and , to sink in it , should you burden love— too great oppression for a tender thing .
is love a tender thing ?
it is too rough , too rude , too boist'rous , and it pricks like thorn .
give me a case to put my visage in .
a visor for a visor !
what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities ?
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me .
come , knock and enter ; and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs .
a torch for me !
let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels ; for i am proverb 'd with a grandsire phrase , i 'll be a candle - holder and look on ; the game was ne'er so fair , and i am done .
dun 's the mouse , the constable 's own word !
nay , that 's not so .
i mean , sir , in delay we waste our lights in vain , like lamps by day .
take our good meaning , for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits .
and we mean well , in going to this mask ; but ' tis no wit to go .
why , may one ask ?
i dreamt a dream to - night .
and so did i .
well , what was yours ?
that dreamers often lie .
in bed asleep , while they do dream things true .
o , then i see propn propn hath been with you .
sometimes she driveth propn a soldier 's neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , of breaches , ambuscadoes , spanish blades , of healths five fathom deep ; and then anon drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes , and being thus frighted , swears a prayer or two and sleeps again .
this is that very propn that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs , which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage .
true , i talk of dreams ; which are the children of an idle brain , propn of nothing but vain fantasy ; which is as thin of substance as the air , and more inconstant than the wind , who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and , being anger 'd , puffs away from thence , turning his face to the dew - dropping south .
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves .
supper is done , and we shall come too late .
but he , that hath the steerage of my course , direct my sail !
on , lusty gentlemen !
strike , drum .
where 's propn , that he helps not to take away ?
he shift a trencher !
he scrape a trencher !
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men 's hands , and they unwash 'd too , ' tis a foul thing .
away with the joint - stools , remove the court - cupboard , look to the plate .
good thou , save me a piece of marchpane and , as thou lovest me , let the porter let in propn propn and propn .
ay , boy , ready .
you are look 'd for and call 'd for , ask 'd for and sought for , in the great chamber .
welcome , gentlemen !
ladies that have their toes unplagu 'd with corns will have a bout with you .
ah ha , my mistresses !
which of you all will now deny to dance ?
she that makes dainty , she , i 'll swear , hath corns .
am i come near ye now ?
welcome , gentlemen !
you are welcome , gentlemen !
come , musicians , play .
a hall , a hall !
give room !
ah , sirrah , this unlook 'd - for sport comes well .
propn propn , thirty years .
what , man ?
propn since the nuptial of propn , come propn as quickly as it will , some five - and - twenty years , and then we mask 'd .
propn more , ' tis more !
his son is elder , sir ; his son is thirty .
will you tell me that ?
his son was but a ward two years ago .
what lady 's that , which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight ?
i know not , sir .
o , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an propn 's ear— propn too rich for use , for earth too dear !
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady propn her fellows shows .
the measure done , i 'll watch her place of stand and , touching hers , make blessed my rude hand .
did my heart love till now ?
forswear it , sight !
for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
this , by his voice , should be a propn .
fetch me my rapier , boy .
what , dares the slave come hither , cover 'd with an antic face , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
now , by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead i hold it not a sin .
why , how now , kinsman ?
wherefore storm you so ?
propn , this is a propn , our foe ; a villain , that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night .
propn propn is it ?
propn he , that villain propn .
content thee , gentle coz , let him alone .
he bears him like a portly gentleman , and , to say truth , propn brags of him to be a virtuous and well - govern 'd youth .
i would not for the wealth of all this town here in my house do him disparagement .
therefore be patient , take no note of him .
it is my will ; the which if thou respect , show a fair presence and put off these frowns , an ill - beseeming semblance for a feast .
it fits when such a villain is a guest .
what , goodman boy ?
am i the master here , or you ?
go to !
you 'll not endure him ?
you will set cock - a - hoop !
you 'll be the man !
why , uncle , ' tis a shame .
go to , go to !
you are a saucy boy .
is't so , indeed ?
you must contrary me !
i 'll make you quiet ; what ! —cheerly , my hearts !
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting .
i will withdraw ; but this intrusion shall , now seeming sweet , convert to bitt'rest gall .
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle fine is this : my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ’ hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ’ kiss .
have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
saints do not move , though grant for prayers ’ sake .
then move not while my prayer 's effect i take .
thus from my lips , by thine my sin is purg 'd .
then have my lips the sin that they have took .
sin from my lips ?
o trespass sweetly urg 'd !
give me my sin again .
you kiss by propn book .
propn , your mother craves a word with you .
what is her mother ?
marry , bachelor , her mother is the lady of the house .
and a good lady , and a wise and virtuous .
is she a propn ?
o dear account !
my life is my foe 's debt .
away , be gone ; the sport is at the best .
ay , so i fear ; the more is my unrest .
is it e'en so ?
more torches here !
come on then , let 's to bed .
ah , sirrah , by my fay , it waxes late ; i 'll to my rest .
come hither , propn .
what is yon gentleman ?
the son and heir of old propn .
what 's he that now is going out of door ?
marry , that , i think , be young propn .
what 's he that follows there , that would not dance ?
i know not .
his name is propn , and a propn , the only son of your great enemy .
my only love , sprung from my only hate !
too early seen unknown , and known too late !
prodigious birth of love it is to me that i must love a loathed enemy .
what 's this ?
what 's this ?
a rhyme i learn 'd even now of one i danc 'd withal .
propn , anon !
come , let 's away ; the strangers all are gone .
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse ; in half an hour she promis 'd to return .
perchance she can not meet him .
that 's not so .
o , she is lame !
love 's heralds should be thoughts , which ten times faster glide than the sun 's beams driving back shadows over low'ring hills .
therefore do nimble - pinion 'd doves draw love , and therefore hath the wind - swift propn wings .
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day 's journey , and from nine till twelve is three long hours ; yet she is not come .
o propn , she comes !
o honey nurse , what news ?
propn thou met with him ?
send thy man away .
propn , stay at the gate .
now , good sweet nurse — o propn , why propn thou sad ?
what a jaunt have i had !
i would thou hadst my bones , and i thy news .
jesu , what haste !
can you not stay awhile ?
do you not see that i am out of breath ?
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ?
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
is thy news good or bad ?
answer to that .
say either , and i 'll stay the circumstance .
let me be satisfied , is't good or bad ?
propn ?
he is not the flower of courtesy , but , i 'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .
go thy ways , wench ; serve propn .
what , have you din 'd at home ?
what says he of our marriage ?
what of that ?
propn , how my head aches !
what a head have i !
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces .
my back o ’ t ’ other side , — ah , my back , my back !
beshrew your heart for sending me about to catch my death with jaunting up and down !
i ’ faith , i am sorry that thou art not well .
sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome ; and , i warrant , a virtuous — where is your mother ?
where is my mother ?
why , she is within .
where should she be ?
how oddly thou reply'st !
your love says , like an honest gentleman , “ where is your mother ? ” ’ o propn 's propn dear !
are you so hot ?
propn do your messages yourself .
here 's such a coil !
come , what says propn ?
have you got leave to go to shrift to - day ?
i have .
then hie you hence to propn propn cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife .
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks : they 'll be in scarlet straight at any news .
hie you to church ; i must another way , to fetch a ladder , by the which your love must climb a bird 's nest soon when it is dark .
i am the drudge , and toil in your delight ; but you shall bear the burden soon at night .
go ; i 'll to dinner ; hie you to the cell .
hie to high fortune !
honest nurse , farewell .
can i go forward when my heart is here ?
turn back , dull earth , and find thy centre out .
propn !
he is wise , and , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .
he ran this way , and leapt this orchard wall .
call , good propn .
nay , i 'll conjure too .
propn !
humours !
madman !
passion !
lover !
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh ; speak but one rhyme , and i am satisfied !
cry but ‘ ay me ! ’ pronounce but ‘ love ’ and ‘ dove ’ ; speak to my gossip propn one fair word , one nickname for her purblind son and heir , propn propn propn , he that shot so trim when propn propn lov 'd the beggar maid !
he heareth not , he stirreth not , be moveth not ; the ape is dead , and i must conjure him .
an if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
this can not anger him .
propn anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress ’ circle of some strange nature , letting it there stand till she had laid it and conjur 'd it down .
that were some spite ; my invocation is fair and honest : in his mistress ’ name , i conjure only but to raise up him .
come , he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night .
blind is his love and best befits the dark .
if love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone .
propn , good night .
i 'll to my truckle - bed ; this field - bed is too cold for me to sleep .
come , shall we go ?
go then , for ' tis in vain ‘ to seek him here that means not to be found .
he jests at scars that never felt a wound .
but soft !
what light through yonder window breaks ?
it is the propn , and propn is the sun !
arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she .
be not her maid , since she is envious .
her vestal livery is but sick and green , and none but fools do wear it .
cast it off .
it is my lady ; o , it is my love !
o that she knew she were !
she speaks , yet she says nothing .
what of that ?
i am too bold ; ' tis not to me she speaks .
two of the fairest stars in all the propn , having some business , do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return .
what if her eyes were there , they in her head ?
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp ; her eyes in propn would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night .
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand !
o that i were a glove upon that hand , that i might touch that cheek !
ay me !
she speaks .
o , speak again , bright angel !
for thou art as glorious to this night , being o'er my head , as is a winged messenger of propn unto the white - upturned wond'ring eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy - pacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air .
o propn , propn !
shall i hear more , or shall i speak at this ?
o , be some other name !
what 's in a name ?
that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet .
so propn would , were he not propn call 'd , propn that dear perfection which he owes without that title .
propn , doff thy name ; and for that name , which is no part of thee , take all myself .
i take thee at thy word .
call me but love , and i 'll be new baptiz 'd ; henceforth i never will be propn .
what man art thou that , thus bescreen 'd in night , so stumblest on my counsel ?
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am .
my name , dear saint , is hateful to myself , because it is an enemy to thee .
had i it written , i would tear the word .
my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words of that tongue 's utterance , yet i know the sound .
how cam'st thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ?
if they do see thee , they will murder thee .
alack , there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords !
look thou but sweet , and i am proof against their enmity .
i would not for the world they saw thee here .
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes ; and but thou love me , let them find me here .
my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
by whose direction found'st thou out this place ?
i am no pilot ; yet , wert thou as far as that vast shore wash 'd with the farthest sea , i would adventure for such merchandise .
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face ; else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to - night .
fain would i dwell on form , fain , fain deny what i have spoke ; but farewell complement !
dost thou love me ?
i know thou wilt say ‘ ay ’ ; and i will take thy word .
yet , if thou swear'st , propn mayst prove false .
at lovers ’ perjuries , they say propn laughs .
o gentle propn , if thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully .
i should have been more strange , i must confess , but that thou overheard'st , ere i was ware , my true love 's passion .
therefore pardon me , and not impute this yielding to light love , which the dark night hath so discovered .
propn , by yonder blessed moon i swear , that tips with silver all these fruit - tree tops— o , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circled orb , lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
what shall i swear by ?
do not swear at all ; or if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i 'll believe thee .
if my heart 's dear love— well , do not swear .
this bud of love , by summer 's ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
good night , good night !
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast !
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction canst thou have to - night ?
th ’ exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine .
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it ; and yet i would it were to give again .
propn thou withdraw it ?
for what purpose , love ?
but to be frank , and give it thee again .
and yet i wish but for the thing i have .
my bounty is as boundless as the sea , my love as deep ; the more i give to thee , the more i have , for both are infinite .
i hear some noise within .
dear love , adieu !
propn , good nurse !
propn propn , be true .
stay but a little , i will come again .
o blessed , blessed night !
i am afeard , being in night , all this is but a dream , too flattering - sweet to be substantial .
three words , dear propn , and good night indeed .
if that thy bent of love be honourable , propn purpose marriage , send me word to - morrow , by one that i 'll procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite ; and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .
propn !
i come , anon .— but if thou meanest not well , i do beseech thee— propn !
by - and - by , i come.— to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief .
to - morrow will i send .
so thrive my soul— a thousand times good night !
a thousand times the worse , to want thy light !
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books ; but love from love , towards school with heavy looks .
propn , hist !
o for a falconer 's voice to lure this tassel - gentle back again !
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud ; else would i tear the cave where propn lies , and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my propn 's name .
it is my soul that calls upon my name .
how silver - sweet sound lovers ’ tongues by night , like softest music to attending ears !
propn !
my dear ?
what o'clock to - morrow shall i send to thee ?
by the hour of nine .
i will not fail .
propn twenty years till then .
i have forgot why i did call thee back .
let me stand here till thou remember it .
i shall forget , to have thee still stand there , remembering how i love thy company .
and i 'll still stay , to have thee still forget , forgetting any other home but this .
i would i were thy bird .
sweet , so would i .
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing .
good night , good night !
parting is such sweet sorrow , that i shall say good night till it be morrow .
sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast !
would i were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest !
hence will i to my ghostly father 's cell , his help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
the grey - ey 'd morn smiles on the frowning night , check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light ; and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day 's path and propn 's fiery wheels .
now , ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and night 's dank dew to dry , i must up - fill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious - juiced flowers .
the earth that 's nature 's mother is her tomb .
what is her burying grave , that is her womb ; and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find ; many for many virtues excellent , none but for some , and yet all different .
virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , and vice sometime 's by action dignified .
two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs — grace and rude will ; and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
good morrow , father .
benedicite !
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
young son , it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
care keeps his watch in every old man 's eye , and where care lodges sleep will never lie ; but where unbruised youth with unstuff 'd brain doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .
therefore thy earliness doth me assure propn art uprous 'd with some distemp'rature ; or if not so , then here i hit it right— our propn hath not been in bed to - night .
that last is true — the sweeter rest was mine .
propn pardon sin !
wast thou with propn ?
with propn , my ghostly father ?
no .
i have forgot that name , and that name 's woe .
i 'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .
i have been feasting with mine enemy , where on a sudden one hath wounded me that 's by me wounded .
propn propn propn !
what a change is here !
is propn , that thou didst love so dear , so soon forsaken ?
young men 's love then lies not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
how much salt water thrown away in waste , to season love , that of it doth not taste !
if e'er thou wast thyself , and these woes thine , propn and these woes were all for propn .
and art thou chang 'd ?
pronounce this sentence then : women may fall when there 's no strength in men .
thou chid'st me oft for loving propn .
for doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
and bad'st me bury love .
not in a grave to lay one in , another out to have .
i pray thee chide not .
she whom i love now propn grace for grace and love for love allow .
the other did not so .
but come , young waverer , come go with me .
wisely , and slow .
they stumble that run fast .
where the devil should this propn be ?
came he not home to - night ?
why , that same pale hard - hearted wench , that propn , torments him so that he will sure run mad .
propn , the kinsman to old propn , propn sent a letter to his father 's house .
a challenge , on my life .
propn will answer it .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
nay , he will answer the letter 's master , how he dares , being dared .
alas , poor propn , he is already dead !
why , what is propn ?
more than propn of propn , i can tell you .
o , he 's the courageous captain of compliments .
he fights as you sing pricksong , keeps time , distance , and proportion ; rests me his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom !
ah , the immortal passado !
the punto reverso !
the hai !
the what ?
the pox of such antic , lisping , affecting fantasticoes — these new tuners of accent !
by propn , a very good blade !
a very tall man !
o , their bones , their bones !
without his roe , like a dried herring .
o flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
now is he for the numbers that propn flowed in .
there 's a french salutation to your french slop .
you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
good morrow to you both .
what counterfeit did i give you ?
that 's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .
meaning , to curtsy .
thou hast most kindly hit it .
a most courteous exposition .
nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
pink for flower .
right .
why , then is my pump well - flower 'd .
well said !
follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump , that , when the single sole of it is worn , the jest may remain , after the wearing , solely singular .
o single - sold jest , solely singular for the singleness !
or i 'll cry a match .
nay , if our wits run the wild - goose chase , i am done ; for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than , i am sure , i have in my whole five .
was i with you there for the goose ?
thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
nay , good goose , bite not !
propn wit is a very bitter sweeting ; it is a most sharp sauce .
and is it not , then , well serv 'd in to a sweet goose ?
o , here 's a wit of cheverel , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
i stretch it out for that word ‘ broad , ’ which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
now art thou sociable , now art thou propn ; now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature .
for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole .
stop there , stop there !
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair .
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
here 's goodly gear !
a sail , a sail !
propn !
propn .
my fan , propn .
propn propn , to hide her face ; for her fan 's the fairer face of the two .
propn ye good morrow , gentlemen .
propn ye good - den , fair gentlewoman .
is it good - den ?
propn no less , i tell ye ; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
out upon you !
what a man are you !
one , gentlewoman , that propn hath made for himself to mar .
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young propn ?
i can tell you ; but young propn will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
you say well .
yea , is the worst well ?
if you be he , sir , i desire some confidence with you .
she will indite him to some supper .
a bawd , a bawd , a bawd !
so ho !
what hast thou found ?
an old hare hoar , and an old hare hoar , is very good meat in propn ; but a hare that is hoar is too much for a score when it hoars ere it be spent .
propn , will you come to your father 's ?
we 'll to dinner thither .
i will follow you .
marry , farewell !
i pray you , sir , what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery ?
a gentleman , nurse , that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
propn a speak anything against me , i 'll take him down , propn a were lustier than he is , and twenty such jacks ; and if i can not , i 'll find those that shall .
scurvy knave !
and thou must stand by too , and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure !
i dare draw as soon as another man , if i see occasion in a good quarrel , and the law on my side .
now , afore propn , i am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
scurvy knave !
nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
i pro- test unto thee— good heart , and i ’ faith i will tell her as much .
what wilt thou tell her , nurse ?
thou dost not mark me .
bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon ; and there she shall at propn propn cell be shriv 'd and married .
here is for thy pains .
no , truly , sir ; not a penny .
this afternoon , sir ?
well , she shall be there .
and stay , good nurse , behind the abbey wall .
within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , which to the high topgallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night .
now propn in propn bless thee !
propn you , sir .
what say'st thou , my dear nurse ?
is your man secret ?
did you ne'er hear say , two may keep counsel , putting one away ?
i warrant thee my man 's as true as steel .
well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
propn , propn !
when ' twas a little prating thing — o , there is a nobleman in town , one propn , that would fain lay knife aboard ; but she , good soul , had as lieve see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
i anger her sometimes , and tell her that propn is the properer man ; but i 'll warrant you , when i say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .
doth not rosemary and propn begin both with a letter ?
ay , nurse ; what of that ?
both with an propn propn , mocker !
that 's the dog 's name .
commend me to thy lady .
ay , a thousand times .
exit propn .
propn .
propn , take my fan , and go before , and apace .
so smile the heavens upon this holy act that after - hours with sorrow chide us not !
amen , amen !
but come what sorrow can , it can not countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight .
do thou but close our hands with holy words , then love - devouring death do what he dare— it is enough i may but call her mine .
these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die , like fire and powder , which , as they kiss , consume .
the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite .
here comes the propn .
o , so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
good even to my ghostly confessor .
propn shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
as much to him , else is his thanks too much .
ah , propn , if the measure of thy joy be heap 'd like mine , and that thy skill be more to blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air , and let rich music 's tongue propn the imagin 'd happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter .
come , come with me , and we will make short work ; for , by your leaves , you shall not stay alone propn propn propn incorporate two in one .
i pray thee , good propn , let 's retire .
thou art like one of these fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says ‘ propn send me no need of thee ! ’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .
am i like such a fellow ?
come , come , thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in propn ; and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
and what to ?
nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
thou !
why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
thy head is as full of quar rels as an egg is full of meat ; and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling .
thou hast quar rell 'd with a man for coughing in the street , because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling !
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
the fee simple ?
o simple !
by my head , here come the capulets .
by my heel , i care not .
follow me close , for i will speak to them .
and but one word with one of us ?
couple it with something ; make it a word and a blow .
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
could you not take some occasion without giving ?
propn , thou consortest with propn .
what , dost thou make us minstrels ?
an thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
we talk here in the public haunt of men .
well , peace be with you , sir .
here comes my man .
but i 'll be hang 'd , sir , if he wear your livery .
marry , go before to field , he 'll be your follower !
your worship in that sense may call him man .
propn , the reason that i have to love thee propn much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting .
villain am i none .
therefore farewell .
i see thou knowest me not .
boy , this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me ; therefore turn and draw .
o calm , dishonourable , vile submission !
propn stoccata carries it away .
propn , you ratcatcher , will you walk ?
what would'st thou have with me ?
will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears ?
make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
i am for you .
propn propn , put thy rapier up .
come , sir , your passado !
propn , for shame !
forbear this outrage !
propn , propn , the propn expressly hath forbid this bandying in propn streets .
hold , tybalt !
good propn !
i am sped .
is he gone and hath nothing ?
what , art thou hurt ?
where is my page ?
go , villain , fetch a surgeon .
no , ' tis not so deep as a well , nor so wide as a church door ; but ' tis enough , ' twill serve .
ask for me to - morrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
i am peppered , i warrant , for this world .
a plague o ’ both your houses !
zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat , to scratch a man to death !
a braggart , a rogue , a villain , that fights by the book of arithmetic !
why the devil came you between us ?
i was hurt under your arm .
i thought all for the best .
help me into some house , propn , or i shall faint .
a plague o ’ both your houses !
they have made worms ’ meat of me .
i have it , and soundly too .
your houses !
that gallant spirit hath aspir ’ d the clouds , which too untimely here did scorn the earth .
here comes the furious propn back again .
away to propn respective lenity , and fire - ey 'd fury be my conduct now !
now , propn , take the ‘ propn back again that late thou gavest me ; for propn 's soul is but a little way above our heads , staying for thine to keep him company .
either thou or i , or both , must go with him .
thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here , propn with him hence .
this shall determine that .
propn , away , be gone !
the citizens are up , and propn slain .
stand not amaz 'd .
the propn will doom thee death if thou art taken .
hence , be gone , away !
o , i am fortune 's fool !
why dost thou stay ?
which way ran he that kill 'd propn ?
propn , that murderer , which way ran he ?
there lies that propn .
where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
there lies the man , slain by young propn , that slew thy kinsman , brave propn .
propn , my cousin !
o my brother 's child !
o prince !
o husband !
o , the blood is spill 'd of my dear kinsman !
propn , as thou art true , for blood of ours , shed blood of propn .
o cousin , cousin !
propn , who began this bloody fray ?
propn , here slain , whom propn 's hand did slay .
propn , that spoke him fair , bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was , and urg 'd withal your high displeasure .
propn he cries aloud , ‘ hold , friends !
this is the truth , or let propn die .
some twenty of them fought in this black strife , and all those twenty could but kill one life .
i beg for justice , which thou , propn , must give .
propn slew propn ; propn must not live .
propn slew him ; he slew propn .
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
not propn , propn ; he was propn 's friend ; his fault concludes but what the law should end , the life of propn .
and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence .
i have an interest in your hate 's proceeding , my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding ; but i 'll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine .
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses ; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses .
therefore use none .
let propn hence in haste , else , when he is found , that hour is his last .
propn hence this body , and attend our will .
mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
propn apace , you fiery - footed steeds , towards phoebus ’ lodging !
such a wagoner as propn would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately .
spread thy close curtain , love - performing night , that runaway eyes may wink , and propn propn to these arms untalk 'd of and unseen .
come , civil night , thou sober - suited matron , all in black , and learn me how to lose a winning match , play 'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .
hood my unmann 'd blood , bating in my cheeks , with thy black mantle till strange love , grown bold , think true love acted simple modesty .
come , gentle night ; come , loving , black - brow 'd night ; give me my propn ; and , when he shall die , take him and cut him out in little stars , and he will make the face of propn so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun .
o , i have bought the mansion of a love , but not possess 'd it ; and though i am sold , not yet enjoy 'd .
so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them .
what hast thou there ?
the cords that propn bid thee fetch ?
ay , ay , the cords .
ay me !
what news ?
why dost thou wring thy hands ?
ah , well - a - day !
he 's dead , he 's dead , he 's dead !
we are undone , lady , we are undone !
alack the day !
he 's gone , he 's kill 'd , he 's dead !
can propn be so envious ?
propn can , though propn can not .
o propn , propn !
who ever would have thought it ?
propn !
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
this torture should be roar 'd in dismal hell .
propn propn slain himself ?
say thou but ‘ i , ’ and that bare vowel ‘ i ’ shall poison more than the death - darting eye of cockatrice .
i am not i , if there be such an ‘ i ’ ; or those eyes shut that make thee answer ‘ i. ’ if he be slain , say ‘ i ’ ; or if not , ‘ no. ’ brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
here on his manly breast .
o , break , my heart !
poor bankrout , break at once !
propn earth , to earth resign ; end motion here , and thou and propn press one heavy bier !
o courteous tybalt !
what storm is this that blows so contrary ?
is propn slaught'red , and is tybalt dead ?
my dear - lov 'd cousin , and my dearer lord ?
then , dreadful trumpet , sound the general doom !
for who is living , if those two are gone ?
propn is gone , and propn banished ; propn that kill 'd him , he is banished .
o propn !
did propn 's hand shed propn 's blood ?
o serpent heart , hid with a flow'ring face !
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
beautiful tyrant !
fiend angelical !
dove - feather 'd raven !
wolvish - ravening lamb !
despised substance of divinest show !
just opposite to what thou justly seem'st— a damned saint , an honourable villain !
o nature , what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh ?
was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound ?
o , that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace !
there 's no trust , no faith , no honesty in men ; all perjur 'd , all forsworn , all naught , all dissemblers .
ah , where 's my man ?
give me some aqua vitae .
these griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
shame come to propn !
propn be thy tongue for such a wish !
he was not born to shame .
upon his brow shame is asham 'd to sit ; for ' tis a throne where honour may be crown 'd propn monarch of the universal earth .
o , what a beast was i to chide at him !
will you speak well of him that kill 'd your cousin ?
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband ?
ah , poor my lord , what tongue shall smooth thy name when i , thy three - hours ’ wife , have mangled it ?
but wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
that villain cousin would have kill 'd my husband .
back , foolish tears , back to your native spring !
your tributary drops belong to woe , which you , mistaking , offer up to joy .
my husband lives , that propn would have slain ; and propn 's dead , that would have slain my husband .
some word there was , worser than propn 's death , that murdered me .
i would forget it fain ; but o , it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners ’ minds !
tybalt is dead , and propn banished. ’ that ‘ banished , ’ that one word ‘ propn propn slain ten thousand tybalts .
but with a rearward following propn 's death , ‘ propn is banished ’ — to speak that word is father , mother , propn , propn , propn , all slain , all dead .
where is my father and my mother , nurse ?
weeping and wailing over propn 's corse .
will you go to them ?
i will bring you thither .
wash they his wounds with tears ?
mine shall be spent , when theirs are dry , for propn 's banishment .
take up those cords .
poor ropes , you are beguil 'd , both you and i , for propn is exil 'd .
he made you for a highway to my bed ; but i , a maid , die maiden - widowed .
hie to your chamber .
i 'll find propn to comfort you .
i wot well where he is .
propn propn , your propn will be here at night .
i 'll to him ; he is hid at propn cell .
o , find him !
give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell .
propn , come forth ; come forth , thou fearful man .
affliction is enamour ’ d of thy parts , and thou art wedded to calamity .
propn , what news ?
what is the propn 's doom ?
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not ?
too familiar is my dear son with such sour company .
i bring thee tidings of the propn 's doom .
what less than doomsday is the propn 's doom ?
a gentler judgment vanish 'd from his lips— not body 's death , but body 's banishment .
ha , banishment ?
be merciful , say ‘ death ’ ; for exile hath more terror in his look , much more than death .
do not say ‘ banishment. ’ hence from propn art thou banished .
be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
there is no world without propn walls , but purgatory , torture , hell itself .
calling death ‘ banishment , ’ thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
o deadly sin !
o rude unthankfulness !
thy fault our law calls death ; but the kind propn , taking thy part , hath rush 'd aside the law , and turn 'd that black word death to banishment .
this is dear mercy , and thou seest it not .
propn torture , and not mercy .
propn is here , where propn lives ; and every cat and dog and little mouse , every unworthy thing , live here in propn and may look on her ; but propn may not .
more validity , more honourable state , more courtship lives in carrion flies than propn .
this may flies do , when i from this must fly ; they are free men , but i am banished .
and sayest thou yet that exile is not death ?
o , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
yet ‘ banished ’ ?
unless philosophy can make a propn , propn a town , reverse a prince 's doom , it helps not , it prevails not .
talk no more .
o , then i see that madmen have no ears .
how should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
propn thou as young as i , propn thy love , an hour but married , propn murdered , doting like me , and like me banished , then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair , and fall upon the ground , as i do now , taking the measure of an unmade grave .
propn propn , hide thyself .
not i ; unless the breath of heartsick groans , mist - like infold me from the search of eyes .
propn , how they knock !
who 's there ?
who knocks so hard ?
whence come you ?
what 's your will ?
welcome , then .
there on the ground , with his own tears made drunk .
o , he is even in my mistress ’ case , just in her case !
o woeful sympathy !
piteous predicament !
even so lies she , propn and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
propn propn sir !
ah sir !
well , death 's the end of all .
propn thou of propn ?
how is it with her ?
doth not she think me an old murderer , now i have stain 'd the childhood of our joy with blood remov 'd but little from her own ?
where is she ?
and how doth she ?
and what says my conceal 'd lady to our cancell 'd love ?
o , she says nothing , sir , but weeps and weeps ; and now falls on her bed , and then starts up , and propn calls ; and then on propn cries , and then down falls again .
as if that name , propn from the deadly level of a gun , did murder her ; as that name 's cursed hand murdered her kinsman .
o , tell me , friar , tell me , in what vile part of this anatomy propn my name lodge ?
tell me , that i may sack the hateful mansion .
hold thy desperate hand .
art thou a man ?
or ill - beseeming beast in seeming both !
thou hast amaz 'd me .
by my holy order , i thought thy disposition better temper 'd .
propn thou slain propn ?
wilt thou slay thyself ?
and slay thy lady that in thy life lives , by doing damned hate upon thyself ?
why railest thou on thy birth , the propn , and earth ?
since birth and propn and earth , all three do meet in thee at once ; which thou at once wouldst lose .
thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man ; thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury , killing that love which thou hast vow 'd to cherish ; propn wit , that ornament to shape and love , misshapen in the conduct of them both , like powder in a skilless soldier 's flask , is set afire by thine own ignorance , and thou dismemb'red with thine own defence .
what , rouse thee , man !
tybalt would kill thee , but thou slewest tybalt .
there art thou happy too .
the law , that threat'ned death , becomes thy friend and turns it to exile .
there art thou happy .
take heed , take heed , for such die miserable .
go get thee to thy love , as was decreed , ascend her chamber , hence and comfort her .
but look thou stay not till the watch be set , for then thou canst not pass to propn , where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage , reconcile your friends , propn pardon of the propn , and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou propn forth in lamentation .
go before , propn .
commend me to thy lady , and bid her hasten all the house to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .
propn is coming .
o propn , i could have stay 'd here all the night to hear good counsel .
o , what learning is !
my lord , i 'll tell my lady you will come .
do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
here is a ring she bid me give you , sir .
hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
how well my comfort is reviv 'd by this !
propn in propn .
i 'll find out your man , and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here .
give me thy hand .
propn late .
but that a joy past joy calls out on me , it were a grief so brief to part with thee .
propn .
things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter .
look you , she lov 'd her kinsman propn dearly , and so did i .
well , we were born to die .
i promise you , but for your company , i would have been abed an hour ago .
these times of woe afford no tune to woo .
propn , good night .
commend me to your daughter .
i will , and know her mind early to - morrow ; to - night she 's mew 'd up to her heaviness .
propn propn , i will make a desperate tender of my child 's love .
i think she will be rul 'd in all respects by me ; nay more , i doubt it not .
what day is this ?
propn , my lord .
propn !
ha , ha !
well , propn is too soon .
propn let it be— a propn , tell her she shall be married to this noble earl .
will you be ready ?
do you like this haste ?
we 'll keep no great ado— a friend or two ; for hark you , propn being slain so late , it may be thought we held him carelessly , being our kinsman , if we revel much .
therefore we 'll have some half a dozen friends , and there an end .
but what say you to propn ?
my lord , i would that propn were to - morrow .
well , get you gone .
a propn be it then .
afore me , it is so very very late that we may call it early by - and - by .
good night .
wilt thou be gone ?
it is not yet near day .
believe me , love , it was the nightingale .
it was the lark , the herald of the morn ; no nightingale .
look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in propn propn .
propn 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day propn tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
i must be gone and live , or stay and die .
propn light is not daylight ; i know it , i .
it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to propn .
therefore stay yet ; thou need'st not to be gone .
i 'll say yon grey is not the morning 's eye , ' propn but the pale reflex of propn 's brow ; nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty propn so high above our heads .
i have more care to stay than will to go .
come , death , and welcome !
juliet wills it so .
how is't , my soul ?
it is , it is !
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , propn harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
some say the lark makes sweet division ; this doth not so , for she divideth us .
more light and light — more dark and dark our woes !
propn !
nurse ?
your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
then , window , let day in , and let life out .
propn , farewell !
one kiss , and i 'll descend .
i must hear from thee every day in the hour , for in a minute there are many days .
o , by this count i shall be much in years propn i again behold my propn !
farewell !
i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
o , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
i doubt it not ; and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come .
methinks i see thee , now thou art below , as one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
either my eyesight fails , or thou propn pale .
and trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
dry sorrow drinks our blood .
o propn , propn !
all men call thee fickle .
if thou art fickle , what dost thou with him that is renown 'd for faith ?
be fickle , propn , for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back .
propn , daughter !
are you up ?
who is't that calls ?
it is my lady mother .
is she not down so late , or up so early ?
what unaccustom 'd cause procures her hither ?
why , how now , juliet ?
propn , i am not well .
propn weeping for your cousin 's death ?
what , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
an if thou could'st , thou could'st not make him live .
therefore have done .
some grief shows much of love ; but much of grief shows still some want of wit .
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
so shall you feel the loss , but not the friend which you weep for .
feeling so the loss , i can not choose but ever weep the friend .
well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death as that the villain lives which slaughter 'd him .
what villain , madam ?
that same villain propn .
villain and he be many miles asunder .
propn pardon him !
i do , with all my heart ; and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart .
that is because the traitor murderer lives .
ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
would none but i might venge my cousin 's death !
we will have vengeance for it , fear thou not .
then weep no more .
i 'll send to one in propn , where that same banish 'd runagate doth live , shall give him such an unaccustom 'd dram that he shall soon keep propn company ; and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied .
indeed i never shall be satisfied with propn till i behold him— dead — is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex 'd .
propn , if you could find out but a man to bear a poison , i would temper it ; that propn should , upon receipt thereof , soon sleep in quiet .
o , how my heart abhors to hear him nam 'd and can not come to him , to wreak the love i bore my cousin propn upon his body that hath slaughter 'd him !
find thou the means , and i 'll find such a man .
but now i 'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
and joy comes well in such a needy time .
what are they , i beseech your ladyship ?
well , well , thou hast a careful father , child ; one who , to put thee from thy heaviness , propn sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects not , nor i look 'd not for .
marry , my child , early next propn morn the gallant , young , and noble gentleman , the propn propn , at propn propn 's propn , shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
these are news indeed !
here comes your father .
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew , but for the sunset of my brother 's son it rains downright .
how now ?
a conduit , girl ?
what , still in tears ?
evermore show'ring ?
how now , wife ?
have you delivered to her our decree ?
i would the fool were married to her grave !
soft !
take me with you , take me with you , wife .
is she not proud ?
doth she not count her blest , propn as she is , that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom ?
not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
propn can i never be of what i hate , but thankful even for hate that is meant love .
how , how , how , how , choplogic ?
what is this ?
out , you green - sickness carrion !
out , you baggage !
you tallow - face !
propn , fie !
what , are you mad ?
hang thee , young baggage !
disobedient wretch !
i tell thee what — get thee to church a propn or never after look me in the face .
speak not , reply not , do not answer me !
my fingers itch .
wife , we scarce thought us blest that propn had lent us but this only child ; but now i see this one is one too much , and that we have a curse in having her .
out on her , hilding !
propn in propn bless her !
you are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
and why , my propn propn ?
i speak no treason .
may not one speak ?
peace , you mumbling fool !
utter your gravity o'er a gossip 's bowl , for here we need it not .
you are too hot .
propn 's bread !
it makes me mad .
propn where you will , you shall not house with me .
propn is near ; lay hand on heart , advise : an you be mine , i 'll give you to my friend ; an you be not , hang , beg , starve , die in the streets , for , by my soul , i 'll ne'er acknowledge thee , nor what is mine shall never do thee good .
trust propn .
bethink you .
i 'll not be forsworn .
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief ?
o sweet my mother , cast me not away !
delay this marriage for a month , a week ; or if you do not , make the bridal bed in that dim monument where propn lies .
talk not to me , for i 'll not speak a word .
do as thou wilt , for i have done with thee .
my husband is on earth , my faith in propn .
how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from propn by leaving earth ?
propn , alack , that propn should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself !
what say'st thou ?
propn thou not a word of joy ?
some comfort , propn .
faith , here it is .
propn is banish 'd ; and all the world to nothing that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you ; or if he do , it needs must be by stealth .
then , since the case so stands as now it doth , i think it best you married with the propn .
o , he 's a lovely gentleman !
propn 's a dishclout to him .
an eagle , madam , propn not so green , so quick , so fair an eye as propn hath .
beshrew my very heart , i think you are happy in this second match , for it excels your first ; or if it did not , your first is dead — or ' twere as good he were as living here and you no use of him .
propn thou this from thy heart ?
and from my soul too ; else beshrew them both .
amen !
what ?
well , thou hast comforted me marvellous much .
go in ; and tell my lady i am gone , having displeas 'd my father , to laurence ’ cell , to make confession and to be absolv 'd .
marry , i will ; and this is wisely done .
ancient damnation !
o most wicked fiend !
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn , or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath prais 'd him with above compare so many thousand times ?
i 'll to the friar to know his remedy .
if all else fail , myself have power to die .
on propn , sir ?
the time is very short .
my father propn will have it so , and i am nothing slow to slack his haste .
you say you do not know the lady 's mind .
propn is the course ; i like it not .
immoderately she weeps for propn 's death , and therefore have i little talk 'd of love ; for propn smiles not in a house of tears .
now , sir , her father counts it dangerous that she do give her sorrow so much sway , and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation of her tears , which , too much minded by herself alone , may be put from her by society .
now do you know the reason of this haste .
i would i knew not why it should be slow 'd .
look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
happily met , my lady and my wife !
that may be , sir , when i may be a wife .
that may be must be , love , on propn next .
come you to make confession to this father ?
to answer that , i should confess to you .
do not deny to him that you love me .
i will confess to you that i love him .
so will ye , i am sure , that you love me .
if i do so , it will be of more price , being spoke behind your back , than to your face .
poor soul , thy face is much abus 'd with tears .
the tears have got small victory by that , for it was bad enough before their spite .
thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report .
that is no slander , sir , which is a truth ; and what i spake , i spake it to my face .
thy face is mine , and thou hast sland'red it .
it may be so , for it is not mine own .
are you at leisure , holy father , now , or shall i come to you at evening mass ?
my leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now .
my lord , we must entreat the time alone .
propn shield i should disturb devotion !
juliet , on propn early will i rouse ye .
till then , adieu , and keep this holy kiss .
o , shut the door !
i hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , on propn next be married to this propn .
tell me not , friar , that thou hear'st of this , unless thou tell me how i may prevent it .
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife i 'll help it presently .
therefore , out of thy long - experienc 'd time , give me some present counsel ; or , behold , ' propn my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire , arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring .
be not so long to speak .
i long to die if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy .
hold , daughter .
i do spy a kind of hope , which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent .
if , rather than to marry propn propn , propn hast the strength of will to slay thyself , then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame , that propn with death himself to scape from it ; and , if thou dar'st , i 'll give thee remedy .
hold , then .
go home , be merry , give consent to marry propn .
propn is to - morrow .
now , when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead .
in the mean time , against thou shalt awake , propn propn by my letters know our drift ; and hither shall he come ; and he and i will watch thy waking , and that very night propn propn bear thee hence to propn .
give me , give me !
o , tell not me of fear !
hold !
i 'll send a friar with speed to propn , with my letters to thy lord .
love give me strength !
and strength shall help afford .
propn , dear father .
so many guests invite as here are writ .
propn , go hire me twenty cunning cooks .
you shall have none ill , sir ; for i 'll try if they can lick their fingers .
how canst thou try them so ?
marry , sir , ' tis an ill cook that can not lick his own fingers .
therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .
go , begone .
we shall be much unfurnish 'd for this time .
what , is my daughter gone to propn propn ?
ay , forsooth .
well , be may chance to do some good on her .
a peevish self - will 'd harlotry it is .
see where she comes from shrift with merry look .
how now , my headstrong ?
where have you been gadding ?
where i have learnt me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests , and am enjoin 'd by holy propn to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon .
propn , i beseech you !
propn i am ever rul 'd by you .
send for the propn .
go tell him of this .
i 'll have this knot knit up to - morrow morning .
i met the youthful lord at propn cell and gave him what becomed love i might , not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .
why , i am glad o n't .
this is well .
stand up .
this is propn should be .
let me see the propn .
ay , marry , go , i say , and fetch him hither .
now , afore propn , this reverend holy friar , all our whole city is much bound to him .
nurse , will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me to - morrow ?
no , not till propn .
there is time enough .
go , nurse , go with her .
we 'll to church to - morrow .
we shall be short in our provision .
propn now near night .
tush , i will stir about , and all things shall be well , i warrant thee , wife .
go thou to propn , help to deck up her .
what , ho !
they are all forth ; well , i will walk myself to propn propn , to prepare him up against to - morrow .
my heart is wondrous light , since this same wayward girl is so reclaim 'd .
what , are you busy , ho ?
need you my help ?
no , madam ; we have cull 'd such necessaries as are behoveful for our state to - morrow .
so please you , let me now be left alone , and let the nurse this night sit up with you ; for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business .
good night .
get thee to bed , and rest ; for thou hast need .
farewell !
propn knows when we shall meet again .
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life .
i 'll call them back again to comfort me .
nurse ! — what should she do here ?
my dismal scene i needs must act alone .
come , vial .
what if this mixture do not work at all ?
shall i be married then to - morrow morning ?
no , no !
this shall forbid it .
lie thou there .
what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministr 'd to have me dead , propn in this marriage he should be dishonour 'd because he married me before to propn ?
i will not entertain so bad a thought .
how if , when i am laid into the tomb , i wake before the time that propn come to redeem me ?
there 's a fearful point !
shall i not then be stifled in the vault , to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in , and there die strangled ere my propn comes ?
o , look !
methinks i see my cousin 's ghost seeking out propn , that did spit his body upon a rapier 's point .
stay , propn , stay !
propn , i come !
this do i drink to thee .
hold , take these keys and fetch more spices , nurse .
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
come , stir , stir , stir !
the second cock hath crow 'd , the curfew bell hath rung , ' tis three o'clock .
look to the bak 'd meats , good propn ; propn not for cost .
faith , you 'll be sick to - morrow for this night 's watching .
no , not a whit .
ay , you have been a mouse - hunt in your time ; but i will watch you from such watching now .
a jealous hood , a jealous hood !
now , fellow , what is there ?
things for the cook , sir ; but i know not what .
make haste , make haste .
propn , fetch drier logs .
call propn ; he will show thee where they are .
i have a head , sir , that will find out logs and never trouble propn for the matter .
mass , and well said ; a merry whoreson , ha !
thou shalt be loggerhead . good propn day .
the propn will be here with music straight , for so he said he would .
i hear him near .
nurse !
wife !
what , ho !
what , nurse , i say !
i 'll go and chat with propn .
hie , make haste , make haste !
propn !
what , mistress !
juliet !
fast , i warrant her , she .
why , lamb !
why , lady !
propn , you slug - abed !
why , love , i say !
madam !
sweetheart !
why , bride !
what , not a word ?
you take your pennyworths now !
sleep for a week ; for the next night , i warrant , the propn propn hath set up his rest that you shall rest but little .
propn forgive me !
i needs must wake her .
propn , madam , madam !
ay , let the propn take you in your bed !
will it not be ?
i must needs wake you .
propn !
lady !
lady !
alas , alas !
help , help !
my lady 's dead !
o well - a - day that ever i was born !
some aqua - vitae , ho !
my lord !
my lady !
what noise is here ?
o lamentable day !
what is the matter ?
look , look !
o heavy day !
o me , o me !
my child , my only life !
revive , look up , or i will die with thee !
help , help !
call help .
for shame , bring propn forth ; her lord is come .
she 's dead , deceas 'd ; she 's dead !
alack the day !
alack the day , she 's dead , she 's dead , she 's dead !
ha !
let me see her .
out alas !
death lies on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
o lamentable day !
o woful time !
death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
ready to go , but never to return .
o son , the night before thy wedding day propn propn lain with thy wife .
see , there she lies , propn as she was , deflowered by him .
i will die and leave him all .
life , living , all is death 's .
have i thought long to see this morning 's face , and doth it give me such a sight as this ?
propn , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
most miserable hour that e'er time saw in lasting labour of his pilgrimage !
but one , poor one , one poor and loving child , but one thing to rejoice and solace in , and cruel propn hath catch 'd it from my sight !
o woe !
o woeful , woeful , woeful day !
most lamentable day , most woeful day that ever ever i did yet behold !
o day !
o day !
o day !
o hateful day !
never was seen so black a day as this .
o woeful day !
o woeful day !
propn , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !
o love !
o life !
not life , but love in death !
propn , distressed , hated , martyr 'd , kill 'd !
uncomfortable time , why cam'st thou now to murder , murder our solemnity ?
o child !
o child !
my soul , and not my child !
dead art thou , dead !
alack , my child is dead , and with my child my joys are buried !
peace , ho , for shame !
confusion 's cure lives not in these confusions .
your part in her you could not keep from death , but propn keeps his part in eternal life .
o , in this love , you love your child so ill that you run mad , seeing that she is well .
dry up your tears and stick your rosemary on this fair corse , and , as the custom is , in all her best array bear her to church ; for though fond nature bids us all lament , yet nature 's tears are reason 's merriment .
propn , go you in ; and , madam , go with him ; and go , propn propn .
every one prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave .
faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
not a dump we !
propn no time to play now .
you will not then ?
no .
i will then give it you soundly .
what will you give us ?
then will i give you the serving - creature .
then will i lay the serving - creature 's dagger on your pate .
i will carry no crotchets .
i 'll re you , i 'll fa you .
do you note me ?
an you re us and fa us , you note us .
pray you put up your dagger , and put out your wit .
then have at you with my wit !
i will dry - beat you with an iron wit , and put up my iron dagger .
answer me like men .
marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
pretty !
what say you , propn propn ?
i say ‘ silver sound ’ because musicians sound for silver .
pretty too !
what say you , propn propn ?
faith , i know not what to say .
o , i cry you mercy !
you are the singer .
i will say for you .
it is ‘ music with her silver sound ’ because musi- cians have no gold for sounding .
then music with her silver sound with speedy help doth lend redress. ’ what a pestilent knave is this same !
hang him , propn !
come , we 'll in here , tarry for the mourners , and stay dinner .
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep , my dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
my bosom 's lord sits lightly in his throne , and all this day an unaccustom 'd spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts .
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead ( strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think !
and breath 'd such life with kisses in my lips that i reviv 'd and was an emperor .
ah me !
how sweet is love itself possess 'd , when but love 's shadows are so rich in joy !
news from propn !
how now , propn ?
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
how doth my lady ?
is my father well ?
how fares my propn ?
that i ask again , for nothing can be ill if she be well .
then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
her body sleeps in propn monument , and her immortal part with angels lives .
i saw her laid low in her kindred 's vault and presently took post to tell it you .
o , pardon me for bringing these ill news , since you did leave it for my office , sir .
is it e'en so ?
then i defy you , stars !
thou knowest my lodging .
get me ink and paper and hire posthorses .
i will hence to - night .
i do beseech you , sir , have patience .
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure .
tush , thou art deceiv 'd .
leave me and do the thing i bid thee do .
propn thou no letters to me from the friar ?
no , my good lord .
no matter .
get thee gone and hire those horses .
i 'll be with thee straight .
well , propn , i will lie with thee to - night .
let 's see for means .
o mischief , thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
i do remember an apothecary , and hereabouts he dwells , which late i noted in tatt'red weeds , with overwhelming brows , culling of simples .
meagre were his looks , sharp misery had worn him to the bones ; and in his needy shop a tortoise hung , an alligator stuff 'd , and other skins of ill - shaped fishes ; and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes , green earthen pots , bladders , and musty seeds , propn of packthread , and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered , to make up a show .
noting this penury , to myself i said , ‘ an if a man did need a poison now propn sale is present death in propn , here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. ’ o , this same thought did but forerun my need , and this same needy man must sell it me .
as i remember , this should be the house .
being holiday , the beggar 's shop is shut .
what , ho !
apothecary !
who calls so loud ?
come hither , man .
let me have a dram of poison , such soon - speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life - weary taker may fall dead , and that the trunk may be discharg 'd of breath as violently as hasty powder fir 'd propn hurry from the fatal cannon 's womb .
such mortal drugs i have ; but propn 's law is death to any he that utters them .
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearest to die ?
my poverty but not my will consents .
i pay thy poverty and not thy will .
put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off , and if you had the strength of twenty men , it would dispatch you straight .
i sell thee poison ; thou hast sold me none .
propn .
buy food and get thyself in flesh .
holy franciscan friar , brother , ho !
this same should be the voice of propn propn .
welcome from propn .
what says propn ?
or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
going to find a barefoot brother out , one of our order , to associate me here in this city visiting the sick , and finding him , the searchers of the town , suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign , propn up the doors , and would not let us forth , so that my speed to propn there was stay 'd .
who bare my letter , then , to propn ?
i could not send it — here it is again— nor get a messenger to bring it thee , so fearful were they of infection .
unhappy fortune !
by my brotherhood , the letter was not nice , but full of charge , of dear import ; and the neglecting it may do much danger .
brother , i 'll go and bring it thee .
she will beshrew me much that propn propn had no notice of these accidents ; but i will write again to propn , and keep her at my cell till propn come— propn living corse , clos 'd in a dead man 's tomb !
give me thy torch , boy .
hence , and stand aloof .
propn then to me , as signal that thou hear'st something approach .
give me those flowers .
do as i bid thee , go .
i am almost afraid to stand alone here in the churchyard ; yet i will adventure .
the obsequies that i for thee will keep propn shall be to strew thy grave and weep .
the boy gives warning something doth approach .
what cursed foot wanders this way to - night to cross my obsequies and true love 's rite ?
what , with a torch ?
propn me , night , a while .
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
hold , take this letter .
early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father .
why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady 's face , but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring — a ring that i must use in dear employment .
but if thou , jealous , dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do , by propn , i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs .
the time and my intents are savage - wild , more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea .
i will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
so shalt thou show me friendship .
take thou that .
live , and be prosperous ; and farewell , good fellow .
for all this same , i 'll hide me hereabout .
his looks i fear , and his intents i doubt .
thou detestable maw , thou womb of death , propn with the dearest morsel of the earth , thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open , and in despite i 'll cram thee with more food .
this is that banish 'd haughty propn that murdered my love 's cousin — with which grief it is supposed the fair creature died— and here is come to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies .
i will apprehend him .
stop thy unhallowed toil , vile propn !
can vengeance be pursu 'd further than death ?
condemned villain , i do apprehend thee .
obey , and go with me ; for thou must die .
i beseech thee , youth , put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury .
o , be gone !
by propn , i love thee better than myself , for i come hither arm 'd against myself .
live , and hereafter say a madman 's mercy bid thee run away .
i do defy thy conjuration and apprehend thee for a felon here .
wilt thou provoke me ?
then have at thee , boy !
o propn , they fight !
i will go call the watch .
o , i am slain !
if thou be merciful , open the tomb , lay me with propn .
in faith , i will .
let me peruse this face .
propn 's kinsman , noble propn propn !
what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode ?
i think he told me propn should have married propn .
said he not so ?
or did i dream it so ?
or am i mad , hearing him talk of propn to think it was so ?
o , give me thy hand , one writ with me in sour misfortune 's book !
o , no , a lantern , slaughtr 'd youth , for here lies propn , and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light .
death , lie thou there , by a dead man interr 'd .
how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry !
which their keepers call a lightning before death .
o , how may i call this a lightning ?
o my love !
my wife !
death , that hath suck 'd the honey of thy breath , propn had no power yet upon thy beauty .
thou art not conquer 'd .
propn 's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks , and death 's pale flag is not advanced there .
tybalt , liest thou there in thy bloody sheet ?
o , what more favour can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy ?
forgive me , cousin .
ah , dear propn , why art thou yet so fair ?
shall i believe that propn propn is amorous , and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night propn again .
here , here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids .
o , here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world - wearied flesh .
eyes , look your last !
arms , take your last embrace !
and , lips , o you the doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death !
thou desperate pilot , now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark !
here 's to my love !
drinks .
thy drugs are quick .
thus with a kiss i die .
propn propn be my speed !
how oft to - night have my old feet stumbled at graves !
who 's there ?
here 's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
propn be upon you !
tell me , good my friend , what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
as i discern , it burneth in the propn monument .
it doth so , holy sir ; and there 's my master , one that you love .
who is it ?
propn .
how long hath he been there ?
full half an hour .
go with me to the vault .
stay then ; i 'll go alone .
fear comes upon me .
o , much i fear some ill unlucky thing .
as i did sleep under this yew tree here , i dreamt my master and another fought , and that my master slew him .
propn !
what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolour 'd by this place of peace ?
propn !
o , pale !
who else ?
what , propn too ?
and steep 'd in blood ?
ah , what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance !
the lady stirs .
o comfortable friar !
where is my lord ?
i do remember well where i should be , and there i am .
where is my propn ?
i hear some noise .
a greater power than we can contradict propn thwarted our intents .
come , come away .
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead ; and propn too .
come , i 'll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
stay not to question , for the watch is coming .
come , go , good propn .
i dare no longer stay .
go , get thee hence , for i will not away .
what 's here ?
a cup , clos 'd in my true love 's hand ?
poison , i see , hath been his timeless end .
o churl !
drunk all , and left no friendly drop to help me after ?
i will kiss thy lips .
haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with a restorative .
thy lips are warm !
lead , boy .
which way ?
propn , noise ?
then i 'll be brief .
o happy dagger !
go , some of you ; whoe'er you find attach .
pitiful sight !
here lies the propn slain ; and propn bleeding , warm , and newly dead , who here hath lain this two days buried .
we see the ground whereon these woes do lie , but the true ground of all these piteous woes we can not without circumstance descry .
here 's propn 's man .
we found him in the churchyard .
hold him in safety till the propn come hither .
here is a friar that trembles , sighs , and weeps .
we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard side .
a great suspicion !
stay the friar too .
what misadventure is so early up , that calls our person from our morning rest ?
what should it be , that they so shriek abroad ?
the people in the street cry ‘ romeo , ’ some ‘ propn and some propn propn ; and all run , with open outcry , toward our monument .
what fear is this which startles in our ears ?
sovereign , here lies the propn propn slain ; and propn dead ; and propn , dead before , warm and new kill 'd .
search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
here is a friar , and slaughter 'd propn 's man , with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men 's tombs .
o heavens !
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
this dagger hath mista'en , for , propn , his house is empty on the back of propn , and it missheathed in my daughter 's bosom !
o me !
this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre .
come , propn ; for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down .
alas , my liege , my wife is dead to - night !
grief of my son 's exile hath stopp 'd her breath .
what further woe conspires against mine age ?
look , and thou shalt see .
o thou untaught !
what manners is in this , to press before thy father to a grave ?
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring , their head , their true descent ; and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death .
meantime forbear , and let mischance be slave to patience .
bring forth the parties of suspicion .
i am the greatest , able to do least , yet most suspected , as the time and place doth make against me , of this direful murder ; and here i stand , both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus 'd .
then say at once what thou dost know in this .
i will be brief , for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale .
propn , there dead , was husband to that propn ; and she , there dead , that propn 's faithful wife .
i married them ; and their stol'n marriage day was propn 's doomsday , whose untimely death propn the new - made bridegroom from this city ; for whom , and not for propn , propn pin 'd .
you , to remove that siege of grief from her , propn and would have married her perforce to propn propn .
then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage , or in my cell there would she kill herself .
then gave i her ( so tutored by my art ) a sleeping potion ; which so took effect as i intended , for it wrought on her the form of death .
meantime i writ to propn that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave , being the time the potion 's force should cease .
but he which bore my letter , propn propn , was stay 'd by accident , and yesternight propn my letter back .
then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred 's vault ; meaning to keep her closely at my cell propn i conveniently could send to propn .
but when i came , some minute ere the time of her awaking , here untimely lay the noble propn and true propn dead .
we still have known thee for a holy man .
where 's propn 's man ?
what can he say in this ?
i brought my master news of propn 's death ; and then in post he came from propn to this same place , to this same monument .
this letter he early bid me give his father , and threat'ned me with death , going in the vault , if i departed not and left him there .
give me the letter .
i will look on it .
where is the propn 's page that rais 'd the watch ?
propn , what made your master in this place ?
he came with flowers to strew his lady 's grave ; and bid me stand aloof , and so i did .
propn comes one with light to ope the tomb ; and by - and - by my master drew on him ; and then i ran away to call the watch .
where be these enemies ?
propn , propn , see what a scourge is laid upon your hate , that propn finds means to kill your joys with love !
and i , for winking at you , discords too , have lost a brace of kinsmen .
all are punish 'd .
o brother propn , give me thy hand .
this is my daughter 's jointure , for no more can i demand .
as rich shall propn 's by his lady 's lie— poor sacrifices of our enmity !
a glooming peace this morning with it brings .
the sun for sorrow will not show his head .
good , speak to the mariners .
propn heigh , my hearts !
cheerly , cheerly , my hearts !
propn , yare !
take in the topsail .
tend to the propn 's whistle !
blow , till thou burst thy wind , if room enough !
where 's the propn ?
to the propn ] play the men !
to the propn ] play the i pray now , keep below .
where is the propn , propn ?
do you not hear him ?
nay , good , be patient .
when the sea is .
hence !
what cares these roarers for the name of the king ?
trouble us not .
good , yet remember whom thou has aboard .
none that i more love than myself .
you are a counsellor ; if you can command these elements to silence , and work the peace of the present , we will not hand a rope more ; use your authority .
i have great comfort from this fellow .
methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him ; his complexion is perfect gallows .
stand fast , good propn , to his hanging .
make the rope of his destiny our cable , for our own doth little advantage .
if he be not born to be hanged , our case is miserable .
down with the topmast !
yare !
lower , lower !
a cry within ] a plague [ a cry within ] a plague upon this howling !
what do you here ?
shall we give o'er and drown ?
have you a mind to sink ?
a pox o ’ your throat , you bawling , blasphemous , incharitable dog !
work you , then .
hang , cur , hang , you whoreson , insolent noise- maker !
we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art .
i 'll warrant him for drowning , though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
all lost !
to prayers , to prayers !
all lost !
what , must our mouths be cold ?
the king and prince at prayers !
let 's assist them , for our case is theirs .
i 'm out of patience .
he 'll be hanged yet , though every drop of water swear against it , and gape at wid'st to glut him .
mercy on us ! ’ — ‘ we split , we split ! ’ — ‘ farewell , my wife and children ! ’ — ‘ farewell , brother ! ’ — ‘ we split , we split , we split ! ’ let 's all sink propn propn .
let 's take leave of him .
now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground — long heath , brown furze , anything .
if by your art , my dearest father , you have put the wild waters in this roar , allay them .
the sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , but that the sea , mounting to propn welkin 's cheek , dashes the fire out .
poor souls , the perished .
had i been any god of power , i would have sunk the sea within the earth , or ere it should the good ship so have swallowed and the fraughting souls within her .
no harm .
i have done nothing but in care of thee , of thee , my dear one , thee , my daughter , who art ignorant of what thou art , naught knowing of whence i am , nor that i am more better than propn , master of a full poor cell , and thy no greater father .
more to know did never meddle with my thoughts .
propn time i should inform thee farther .
lend thy hand , and pluck my magic garment from me .— so : [ lays down his cloak ] [ lays down his cloak ] lie there , my art .— propn thou thine eyes ; have comfort .
the direful spectacle of the wreck , which touched the very virtue of compassion in thee , i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul— no , not so much perdition as an hair propn to any creature in the vessel which thou heard'st cry , which though saw'st sink .
sit down ; for thou must now know farther .
you have often begun to tell me what i am , but stopped and left me to a bootless inquisition , concluding ‘ stay , not propn the hour 's now come ; the very minute bids thee ope thine ear , propn , and be attentive .
propn thou remember a time before we came unto this cell ?
i do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not out three years old .
certainly , sir , i can .
by what ?
propn far off , and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants .
had i not four or five women once that tended me ?
thou hadst , and more , propn .
but how is it that this lives in thy mind ?
what seest thou else in the dark backward and abyss of time ?
if thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here , how thou cam'st here thou mayst .
but that i do not .
propn mother was a piece of virtue , and she said thou wast my daughter ; and thy father was propn of propn , and his only heir and princess no worse issued .
o , the heavens !
what foul play had we that we came from thence ?
or blessèd was't we did ?
both , both , my girl .
by foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , but blessedly holp hither .
please you , farther .
my brother and thy uncle , called propn i pray thee mark me , that a brother should be so perfidious — he whom next thyself of all the world i loved , and to him put the manage of my state ; as at that time through all the signories it was the first , and propn the prime duke , being so reputed in dignity , and for the liberal arts without a parallel ; those being all my study , the government i cast upon my brother , and to my state grew stranger , being transported and rapt in secret studies .
thy false uncle— dost thou attend me ?
propn , most heedfully .
o good sir , i do .
i pray thee mark me .
i , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which , but by being so retired , propn prized all popular rate , in my false brother awakened an evil nature ; and my trust , like a good parent , did beget of him a falsehood , in its contrary as great as my trust was , which had indeed no limit , a confidence sans bound .
he being thus lorded , not only with what my revenue yielded , but what my power might else exact , like one who having into truth , by telling of it , made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie , he did believe he was indeed the duke ; out propn substitution , and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative ; hence his ambition growing— dost thou hear ?
your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
to have no screen between this part he played and him he played it for ; he needs will be propn propn .
me , poor man , my library was dukedom large enough : of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable ; confederates— so dry he was for sway — with the propn of propn to give him annual tribute , do him homage , subject his coronet to his crown , and bend the dukedom , yet unbowed alas , poor milan ! — to most ignoble stooping .
o the heavens !
mark his condition and th ’ event ; then tell me if this might be a brother .
i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother : good wombs have borne bad sons .
now the condition .
the propn of propn , being an enemy to me inveterate , hearkens my brother 's suit ; which was that he , in lieu propn premises of homage and i know not how much tribute , should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom , and confer fair propn , with all the honours , on my brother ; whereon , a treacherous army levied , one midnight propn to propn purpose did propn open the gates of propn , and , propn dead of darkness , the ministers for propn purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self .
propn , for pity !
i , not rememb'ring how i cried out then , will cry it o'er again : it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to't .
hear a little further , and then i 'll bring thee to the present business which now 's upon 's ; without the which this story were most impertinent .
propn did they not that hour destroy us ?
well demanded , wench ; my tale provokes that question .
there they hoist us , to cry to propn sea that roared to us , to sigh to propn winds , whose pity , sighing back again , did us but loving wrong .
propn , what trouble was i then to you !
o , a cherubin propn wast that did preserve me .
thou didst smile , infused with a fortitude from propn , when i have decked the sea with drops full salt , under my burden groaned ; which raised in me an undergoing stomach , to bear up against what should ensue .
how came we ashore ?
by propn divine .
some food we had , and some fresh water , that a noble propn , propn , out of his charity , — who being then appointed propn of this design , — did give us ; with propn garments , linens , stuffs , and necessaries , which since have steaded much ; so , of his gentelness knowing i loved my books , he furnished me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom .
would i might but ever see that man !
here in this island we arrived , and here have i , thy schoolmaster , made thee more profit than other princesess ’ can , that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful .
heavens thank you for't .
and now i pray you , sir— for still ’ tis beating in my mind , — your reason for raising this sea - storm .
know thus far north .
by accident most strange , bountiful propn , now my dear lady , hath mine enemies brought to this shore ; and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star , whose influence if now i court not , but omit , my fortunes will ever after droop .
i am ready now .
approach , my propn , come !
i come to answer thy best pleasure ; be't to fly , to swim , to dive into the fire , to ride on the curled clouds , to thy strong bidding task propn and all his quality propn thou , spirit , propn to point the tempest that i bade thee ?
to every article .
my brave spirit !
who was so firm , so constant , that this coil would not infect his reason ?
not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and played some tricks of desperation .
all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , then all afire with me : the propn 's son propn , with hair up - staring — then like reeds , not hair— was the first man that leapt , cried , ’ hell is empty , and all the devils are here. ’ why , that 's my spirit !
but was not this nigh shore ?
close by , my master .
but are they , propn , safe ?
not a hair perished ; on their sustaining garments not a blemish , but fresher than before ; and as thou bad'st me , in troops i have dispersed them ’ bout the isle .
the propn 's son have i landed by himself , whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle , and sitting , his arms in this sad knot .
of the propn 's ship , the mariners , say how thou hast disposed , and all the rest propn fleet .
propn , thy charge exactly is performed ; but there 's more work .
what is the time o'th ’ day ?
past the mid season .
at least two glasses .
the time propn six and now must by us both be spent most preciously .
is there more toil ?
since thou dost give me pains let me remember thee what thou hast promised , which is not yet performed me .
how now ?
moody ?
what is't thou canst demand ?
my liberty .
before the time be out ?
no more !
i prithee , remember i have done thee worthy service , told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served without or grudge or grumblings .
propn did promise to bate me a full year .
dost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee ?
no .
thou dost , and think'st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep , to run upon the sharp wind of the north , to do me business in the veins propn earth when it is baked with frost .
i do not , sir .
thou liest , malignant thing !
propn thou forgot the foul witch propn , who with age and envy was grown into a hoop ?
propn thou forgot her ?
no , sir .
thou hast .
where was she born ?
speak ; tell me .
propn , in propn .
i must once in a month recount what thou hast been , which thou forget'st .
this damned witch propn , for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing , from propn propn propn was banished — for one thing she did they would not take her life .
is not this true ?
ay , sir .
this blue - eyed hag was hither brought with child , and here was left by th ’ sailors .
then was this island— propn for the son that she did litter here , a freckled whelp , hag - born — not honoured with a human shape .
yes , propn her son .
dull thing , i say so : he , that propn propn now i keep in service .
i thank thee , master .
if thou more murmur'st , i will rend an oak , and peg thee in his knotty entrails till propn hast howled away twelve winters .
do so , and after two days i will discharge thee .
that 's my noble master !
what shall i do ?
go take this shape , and hither come propn : go ; hence with diligence !
propn propn ] [ propn propn ] propn , dear heart , awake !
thou hast slept well ; propn .
the strangeness of your story put propn in me .
shake it off .
come on ; we 'll visit propn my slave , who never yields us kind answer .
propn a villain , sir , i do not love to look on .
but as ’ tis , we can not miss him : he does make our fire , fetch in our wood , and serves in offices that profit us .
there 's wood enough within .
when ?
fine apparition !
my lord , it shall be done .
thou poisonous slave , got by the devil himself upon thy wicked dam , come forth !
as wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed with raven 's feather from unwholesome fen propn on you both !
a south - west blow on ye and blister you all o'er !
i must eat my dinner .
this island 's mine , by propn my mother , which thou tak'st from me .
all the charms of propn , toads , beetles , bats , light on you !
for i am all the subjects that you have , which first was mine own king , and here you sty me in this hard rock , whiles you do keep from me the rest o ‘ th ’ island .
thou most lying slave , propn stripes may move , not kindness !
i have used thee , propn as thou art , with human care , and lodged thee in mine own cell , till thou didst seek to violate the honour of my child .
propn had been done !
thou didst prevent me ; i had peopled else this isle with propn .
abhorrèd slave , which any print of goodness wilt not take , being capable of all ill !
hag - seed , hence !
fetch us in fuel , and be quick , thou'rt best , to answer other business .— propn thou , malice ?
so , slave , hence !

this is no mortal business , nor no sound that the earth owes .— i hear it now above me .

a spirit ?

he hath lost his fellows , and strays about to find ’ em i might call him a thing divine , for nothing natural i ever saw so noble .

how ?
the best ?
what wert thou if the propn of propn heard thee ?
a single thing , as i am now , that wonders to hear thee speak of propn .
he does hear me , and that he does i weep ; myself am propn , who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld the propn my father wrecked .
propn , for mercy !
yes , faith , and all his lords , the propn of propn and his brave son being twain .

no , as i am a man .

no ; i will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power .
what , i say , my foot my tutor ?

not since widow propn 's time .
propn ?
a pox o'that !
how came that widow in ?
propn propn !

he hath raised the wall , and houses too .
what impossible matter will he make easy next ?
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
and sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .
to propn ] ay .
to propn ] [ to propn ] why , in good time .
to propn ] why , in good time .
to propn ] propn , we were talking that our garments seem [ to propn ] propn , we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at propn at the marriage of your daughter , who is not queen .
and the rarest that e'er came there .
bate , i beseech you , widow propn .
o , widow dido !
ay , widow propn .
to propn ] is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day [ to propn ] is not , sir , my i wore it ?
i mean , in a sort .
you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense .
would i have never married my daughter there !
for , coming thence , my son is lost , and , in my rate , she too , who is so far from propn removed i ne'er again shall see her .
no , no ; he 's gone .
to propn ] propn , you may thank yourself for this [ to propn ] propn , you may thank yourself for this great loss , that would not bless our propn with your daughter , but rather lose her to an propn , where she , at least , is banished from your eye , who hath cause to wet the grief o n't .
prithee , peace .
you were kneeled to an importuned otherwise by all of us , and the fair soul herself weighed between loathness and obedience at which end propn beam should bow .
so is the dear'st o'th ’ loss .
my lord propn , the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in — you rub the sore , when you should bring the plaster .
very well .
and most chirurgeonly .
to propn ] it is foul weather in us all , good sir , [ to propn ] it is foul weather in us all , good sir , when you are cloudy .
very foul .

and were the king o n't , what would i do ?
i'th ’ commonwealth i would by contraries execute all things , for no kind of traffic would i admit ; no name of magistrate ; letters should not be known ; riches , poverty , and use of service , none ; contract , succession , propn , bound of land , tilth , vineyard , none ; no use of metal , corn , or wine , or oil ; no occupation ; all men idle , all ; and women too , but innocent and pure ; no sovereignty— [ to propn ] yet he would be king o n't .

none , man ; all idle : whores and knaves .

save his majesty !
long live propn !
i do well believe your highness , and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen , who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing .
twas you we laughed at .
who , in this kind of merry fooling , am nothing to you ; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still .
what a blow was there given !
an it had not fallen flat - long .
you are gentlemen of brave mettle ; you would lift the moon out of her sphere , if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .
we would so , and then go a - bat - fowling .. [ to propn ] propn , good my lord , be not angry .
to propn ] propn , good my lord , be not angry .
no , i warrant you ; i will not adventure my discre- tion so weakly .
will you laugh me asleep , for i am very heavy ?
go sleep , and hear us .
i wish mine eyes would , with themselves , shut up my thoughts : i find they are inclined to do so .
we two , my lord , will guard your person while you take your rest , and watch your safety .
thank you .
wondrous heavy .
what a strange drowsiness possesses them !
it is the quality o'th ’ climate .
why propn it not then our eyelids sink ?
i find not myself disposed to sleep .
nor i ; my spirits are nimble .
they fell together all , as by consent ; they dropped , as by a thunder - stroke .
do you not hear me speak ?
i do ; and surely it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st out of thy sleep .
what is it thou didst say ?
this is a strange repose , to be asleep with eyes wide open ; standing , speaking , moving , and yet so fast asleep .
noble propn , propn let'st thy fortune sleep — die rather ; wink'st propn thou art waking .
thou dost snore distinctly ; there 's meaning in thy snores .
well , i am standing water .
i 'll teach you how to flow .
do so : to ebb propn sloth instructs me .
o , if you but knew how you the purpose cherish propn thus you mock it ; how in stripping it .
you more invest it !
ebbing men , indeed , most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth .
thus , sir : although this lord of weak remembrance , this , who shall be of as little memory when he is earth 'd , hath here almost persuaded— for he 's a spirit of persuasion , only propn to persuade — the king his son 's alive , ’ tis as impossible that he 's undrowned as he that sleeps here swims .
i have no hope that he 's undrowned .
no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even propn can not pierce a wink beyond , but doubt discovery there .
will you grant with me that propn is drowned ?
he 's gone .
then , tell me , who 's the next heir of propn ?
propn .
how say you ?
propn true my brother 's daughter 's propn of propn ; so is she heir of propn ; ’ twixt which regions there is some space .
there be that can rule propn as well as he that sleeps , lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this propn ; i myself could make a chough of as deep chat .
o , that you bore the mind that i do !
what a sleep were this for your advancement !
do you understand me ?
methinks i do .
and how does your content tender your own good fortune ?
for all the rest , they 'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk ; they 'll tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour .
propn case , dear friend , shall be my precedent : as thou got'st propn , i 'll come by propn .
draw thy sword — one stroke shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest , and i the propn shall love thee .
draw together , and when i rear my hand , do you the like , to fall it on propn .
propn sings in propn 's ear ] [ propn sings in propn 's ear ] while you here do snoring lie , open - eyed conspiracy his time doth take .

ho , awake !
waking ] why , how now ?
to propn ] propn this what 's the matter ?
it struck mine ear most terribly .
i heard nothing .
heard you this , propn ?
upon mine honour , sir , i heard a humming , and that a strange one too , which did awake me .
lead off this ground , and let 's make further search for my poor son .
heavens keep him from these beasts !
for he is sure propn island .
lead away .
all the infections that the sun sucks up from bogs , fens , flats , on propn fall , and make him by inch - meal disease !
a noise of thunder heard ] [ a noise of thunder heard ] his spirits hear me , and yet i needs must curse .
here comes a spirit of his , and to torment me for bringing wood in slowly , i 'll fall flat .
perchance he will not mind me .
a fish : he smells like a fish ; a very ancient and fish - like smell ; a kind of not- of - the - newest propn - propn .
a strange fish !
when they will not give a dolt to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten to see a dead indian .
legged like a man , and his fins like arms !
warm propn troth !
i do now let loose my opinion ; hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
thunder ] [ propn ] propn , the storm is come again !
i will here , shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
this is a scurvy tune too : but here 's my comfort .
what 's the matter ?
have we devils here ?
i have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs ; for it hath been said , ‘ as proper a man as ever went on four legs can not make him give ground. ’ and it shall be said so again , while propn breathes at nostrils .
this is some monster of the isle with four legs , who hath got , as i tak it , an ague .
where the devil should he learn our language ?
he 's in his fit now , and does not talk after the wisest .
four legs and two voices — a most delicate monster !
his forward voice now is to speak well of his friend ; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract .
if all the wine in my bottle will recover him , i will help his ague .
come .
caliban drinks ] amen !
i will pour some in [ caliban drinks ] thy other mouth .
stephano !
doth thy other mouth call me ?
if thou beest trinculo , come forth .
he pulls propn out from under propn 's cloak by the legs ] thou art very propn indeed !
how cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon - calf ?
can he vent propn ?
i took him to be killed with a thunder - stroke .
but art thou not drowned , propn ?
i hope now thou art not drowned .
is the storm overblown ?
i hid me under the dead moon - calf 's gaberdine for fear of the storm .
and art thou living , propn ?
o propn , two propn scaped !
prithee , do not turn me about ; my stomach is not constant .
to propn ] how didst thou ’ scape ?
how cam'st thou hither ?
swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither .
i escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o'erboard — by this bottle , which i made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since i was cast ashore .
i 'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject , for the liquor is not earthly .
here , kiss the book .
though thou canst swim like a duck , thou art made like a goose .
propn thou not dropped from propn ?
out propn moon , i do assure thee : i was the man propn moon when time was .
the man i'th ’ moon ?
i 'll show thee every fertile inch o'th ’ island ; and i will kiss thy foot .
i prithee , be my god .
come on then ; down , and swear .
i shall laugh myself to death at this puppy - headed monster .
a most scurvy monster !
i could find in my heart to beat him— come , kiss .
i 'll show thee the best springs ; i 'll pluck thee berries ; i 'll fish for thee , and get thee wood enough .
a plague upon the tyrant that i serve !
i 'll bear him no more sticks , but follow thee , thou wondrous man .
a most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard !
i prithee , let me bring thee where crabs grow ; and i with my long nails will dig thee pignuts , show thee a jay 's nest , and instruct thee how to snare the nimble marmoset , i 'll bring thee to clustering filberts , and sometimes i 'll get thee young sea - mews from the rock .

o brave monster !
lead the way .
this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious , but the mistress which i serve quickens what 's dead and makes my labours pleasures .
o , she is ten times more gentle than her father 's crabbed , and he 's composed of harshness .
i forget , but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours , most busil'est , when i do it .
o most dear mistress , the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do .
if you 'll sit down i 'll bear your logs the while .
pray , give me that ; i 'll carry it to the pile .
it would become me as well as it does you ; and i should do it with much more ease , for my good will is to it , and yours it is against .

propn propn !
indeed the top of admiration , worth what 's dearest to the world !
but you , o you , so perfect and so peerless , are created of every creature 's best !
but i prattle something too wildly , and my father 's precepts i therein do forget .

bite him to death , i prithee .
the poor monster 's my subject , and he shall not suffer indignity .
i thank my noble lord .
wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit i made to thee ?
as i told thee before , i am subject to a tyrant , a sorcerer , that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island .
thou liest .
trinculo , if you trouble him any more in 's tale , by this hand , i will supplant some of your teeth .
why , i said nothing .
thou shalt be lord of it , and i 'll server thee .
how now shall this be compassed ?
propn thou bring me to the party ?
thou liest ; thou canst not .
what a pied ninny 's this !
trinculo , run into no further danger : interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , i 'll turn my mercy out o'doors and make a stockfish of thee .
why , what did i ?
i did nothing .
i 'll go farther off .
propn thou not say he lied ?
thou liest .
do i so ?
take thou that .
beating propn ] as you like [ beating propn ] as you like this , give me the lie another time .
ha , ha , ha !
beat him enough ; after a little time i 'll beat him too .

remember first to possess his books , for without them he 's but a sot , as i am , nor hath not one spirit to command — they all do hate him as rootedly as i .
is it so brave as lass ?
dost thou like the plot , propn ?
excellent .
ay , on mine honour .
thou mak'st me merry ; i am full of pleasure .
at thy request , monster , i will do reason , any reason .
come on , propn , let us sing .
flout ’ em and scout ’ em , and scout ’ em and flout ’ em propn is free .
that 's not the tune .
what is this same ?
this is the tune of our catch , played by the picture of nobody .
o , forgive me my sins !
art thou afeared ?
no , monster , not i .
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears , and sometime voices that , if i then had waked after long sleep , will make me sleep again : and then , in dreaming , the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me , that when i waked i cried to dream again .
this will prove a brave kingdom to me , where i shall have my music for nothing .
when prospero is destroyed .
he lays it on .
wilt come ?
i 'll follow , propn .
by your patience , i needs must rest me .
old lord , i can not blame thee , who am myself attached with weariness , to th ’ dulling of my spirits .
sit down and rest .
well , let him go .
aside to propn ] i am right glad that he 's so out [ aside to propn ] i am right glad that he 's so out of hope .
do not for one repulse forgo the purpose that you resolved t'effect .
aside to propn ] the next advantage [ aside to propn ] the next advantage will we take throughly .
what harmony is this ?
my good friends , hark !
marvellous sweet music !
give us kind keepers , heavens !
what were these ?
a living drollery .
now i will believe that there are unicorns , that in propn there is one tree , the phoenix ’ throne , one phoenix at this hour reigning there .
if in propn i should report this now , would they believe propn if i should say i saw such islanders ?
for certes these are people of the island , who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet note , their manners are more gentle - kind than of our human generation you shall find many , nay , almost any .
aside ] honest lord , [ aside ] honest lord , propn hast said well , for some of you there present are worse than devils .

not i .
faith , sir , you need not fear .
when we were boys , who would believe that there were mountaineers dewlapped like bulls , whose throats had hanging at ’ em propn of flesh ?
or that there were such men whose heads stood in their breasts ?
which now we find each putter - out of five for one will bring us good warrant of .
you are three men of sin , whom propn , that hath to instrument this lower world and what is propn , the never - surfeited sea propn caused to belch up you , and on this island where man doth not inhabit , you ’ mongst men being most unfit to live .
i have made you mad , and even with suchlike valour men hang and drown their proper selves .
you fools !
if you could hurt , your swords are now too massy for your strengths and will not be uplifted .
but remember , for that 's my business to you , that you three from propn did supplant good prospero ; exposed unto the sea , which hath requit it , propn and his innocent child ; for which foul deed , the powers , delaying , not forgetting , have incensed the seas and shores , yea , all the creatures , against your peace .
i'th ’ name of something holy sir , why stand you in this strange stare ?
therefore my son propn ooze is bedded , and i 'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded , and with him there lie mudded .
but one fiend at a time , i 'll fight their legions o'er .
i 'll be thy second .
i do beseech you that are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly , and hinder them from this ecstasy may now provoke them to .
to propn ] if i have too austerely punished you , [ to propn ] if i have too your compensation makes amends , for i have given you here a third of mine own life— or that for which i live — who once again i tender to thy hand .
i do believe it against an oracle .
what , propn !
my industrious servant , propn !
what would my potent master ?
here i am .
thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform , and i must use you in such another trick .
presently ?
ay , with a twink .
before you can say ‘ come ’ and ‘ propn and breathe twice and cry ‘ so , propn each one , tripping on his toe will be here with mop and mow .
do you love me , master ?
no ?
dearly , my delicate propn .
do not approach propn thou dost hear me call .
well , i conceive .
i warrant you , sir ; the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardour of my liver .
propn now come , my propn !
bring a corollary , rather than want a spirit .
appear and pertly !
no tongue , all eyes !
be silent .
approach , rich propn , her to entertain .
a contract of true love to celebrate ; and some donation freely to estate on the blest lovers .
tell me , heavenly bow , if propn or her son , as thou dost know , do now attend the queen .
since they did plot the means that dusky propn my daughter got , her and her blind boy 's scandaled company i have forsworn .
of her society be not afraid .
here thought they to have done some wanton charm upon this man and miad , whose vows are that no bed - right shall be paid till propn 's torch be lighted — but in vain .
high'st queen of state , propn propn , comes ; i know her by her gait .
how does my bounteous sister ?
go with me to bless this twain , that they may propn be and honoured in their issue .
propn , riches , marriage - blessing , long continuance , and increasing , hourly joys be still upon you !
propn sings her blessings upon you .
propn 's increase , foison plenty , propn and garners never empty , propn and clust'ring bunches growing , plants and goodly burden bowing ; spring come to you at the farthest in the very end of harvest !
scarcity and want shall shun you , ceres ’ blessing so is on you .
spirits , which by mine art i have from their confines call 'd to enact my present fancies .
propn now , silence !
your nymphs , called naiads of the wandering brooks , with your sedged crowns and over - harmless looks , leave your crisp channels and on this green land propn your summons ; propn does command .
you sunburnt sicklemen , of propn weary , come hither from the furrow and be merry ; make holiday , your rye - straw hats put on , and these fresh nymphs encounter every one in country footing .
to the spirits ] well done !
no more !
these our actors , as i foretold you , were all spirits , and are melted into air , into thin air ; and , like the baseless fabric of this vision , the cloud - capped towers , the gorgeous palaces , the solemn temples , the great globe itself , propn , all which it inherit , shall dissolve , and , like this insubstantial pageant faded , leave not a rack behind .
be not disturbed with my infirmity .
we wish your peace .
thy thoughts i cleave to .
what 's thy pleasure ?
propn , we must prepare to meet with propn .
say again : where didst thou leave these variets ?
i told you , sir , they were red - hot with drinking ; so fun of valour that they smote the air for breathing in their faces , beat the ground for kissing of their feet ; yet always bending towards their project .
this was well done , my bird .
a devil , a born devil , on whose nature nurture can never stick ; on whom my pains , humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost , and , as with age his body uglier grows , so his mind cankers .
i will plague them all , even to roaring .
come , hang them on this line .
monster , you fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the propn with us .
monster , i do smell all horse - piss , at which my nose is in great indignation .
if i should take a displeasure against you , look propn propn wert but a lost monster .
i will fetch off my bottle , though i be o'er ears for my labour .
prithee , my king , be quiet .
do that good mischief which may make this island propn own for ever , and i , thy propn , for aye thy foot - licker .
seeing the apparel ] o propn propn !

o worthy propn !
look what a wardrobe here is for thee !

thy grace shall have it .
the dropsy drown this fool !
what do you mean to dote thus on such luggage ?
let't alone , and do the murder first .
if he awake , from toe to crown he 'll fill our skins with pinches , make us strange stuff .
i will have none o n't .
we shall lose our time , and all be turned to barnacles , or to apes with foreheads villanous low .

let them be hunted soundly .
how 's the day ?
on the sixth hour ; at which time , my lord , you said our work should cease .
i did say so when first i raised the tempest .
say , my spirit , how fares the propn and 's followers ?
confined together in the same fashion as you gave in charge , just as you left them ; all prisoners , sir in the lime - grove which weather - fends your cell ; they can not budge till your release .
dost thou think so , spirit ?
mine would , sir , were i human .
go release them , propn .
my charms i 'll break , their senses i 'll restore , and they shall be themselves .
i 'll fetch them , sir .
ye elves of hills , brooks , standing lakes and groves , and ye that on the sands with printless foot do chase the ebbing propn and do fly him when he comes back ; you demi - puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make , propn the ewe not bites , and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrooms , that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew ; by whose aid , weak masters though ye be , i have bedimmed the noontide sun , called forth the mutinous winds , and ’ twixt the green sea and the azured vault propn roaring war — to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire , and rifted propn 's stout oak with his own bolt ; the strong - based promontory have i made shake , and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar : graves at my command have waked their sleepers , oped , and let ’ em forth by my so potent art .

i drink the air before me , and return or ere your pulse twice beat .
all torment , trouble , wonder , and amazement inhabits here .
some heavenly power guide us out of this fearful country !

if thou beest prospero , give us particulars of thy preservation ; how thou hast met us here , who three hours since were wrecked upon this shore ; where i have lost— how sharp the point of this remembrance is ! — my dear son propn .
i am woe for't , sir .
irreparable is the loss , and patience says it is past her cure .
i rather think you have not sought her help , of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid , and rest myself content .
you the like loss ?
as great to me as late ; and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you , for i have lost my daughter .
a daughter ?
when did you lose your daughter ?
in this last tempest .
i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth , these words are natural breath .
but howsoe'er you have been jostled from your senses , know for certain that i am prospero , and that very propn which was thrust forth of propn , who most strangely upon this shore , where you were wrecked , was landed to be the lord o n't .
no more yet of this , for ‘ tis a chronicle of day by day , not a relation for a breakfast , nor befitting this first meeting .
here have i few attendants and subjects none abroad .
pray you , look in .
my dukedom since you have given me again , i will requite you with as good a thing ; at least bring forth a wonder to content ye as much as me my dukedom .
sweet lord , you play me false .
no , my dear'st love , i would not for the world .
yes , for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle , and i would call it fair play .
if this prove a vision of the island , one dear son propn i twice lose .
a most high miracle .
now all the blessings of a glad father compass thee about !
arise and say how thou cam'st here .
o wonder !
how many goodly creatures are there here !
how beauteous mankind is !
o brave new world that has such people propn !
propn new to thee .
to propn ] what is this maid with whom thou [ to propn ] what is this maid with whom thou wast at play ?
propn , she is mortal ; but by immortal providence she 's mine .
i chose her when i could not ask my father for his advice , nor thought i had one .
she is daughter to this famous propn of propn , of whom so often i have heard renown , but never saw before ; of whom i have received a second life ; and second father this lady makes him to me .
i am hers .
but o , how oddly will it sound that i must ask my child forgiveness !
i have inly wept , or should have spoke ere this .
i say amen , propn !
was propn thrust from propn , that his issue should become kings of propn ?
o rejoice beyond a common joy !
and set it down with gold on lasting pillars : in one voyage did propn her husband find at propn , and propn , her brother , found a wife where he himself was lost ; prospero his dukedom in a poor isle ; and all of ourselves , when no man was his own [ to propn and propn ] give me your hands .
be it so !
amen !
here is more of us !
i prophesied if a gallows were on land this fellow could not drown .
to the propn ] now , [ to the propn ] now , blasphemy , that swear'st grace o'erboard : not an oath on shore ?
propn thou no mouth by land ?
what is the news ?
the best news is that we have safely found our propn and company ; the next , our ship , which but three glasses since we gave out split , is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when we first put out to sea .

there are yet missing of your company some few odd lads that you remember not .

o propn , these be brave spirits indeed !
how fine my master is !
i am afraid he will chastise me .

what things are these , my lord antonio ?

very like ; one of them is a plain fish , and no doubt marketable .

i shall not fear fly- blowing .
