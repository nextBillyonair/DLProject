<SOS> he hath done good service , lady , in these wars . <EOS>|||<SOS> propn propn served well in the war , my lady . <EOS>
<SOS> the reason that i gather he is mad , besides this present instance of his rage , is a mad tale he told today at dinner of his own doors being shut against his entrance . <EOS>|||<SOS> the reason i think he ’ s insane , besides the way he just acted , is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house . <EOS>
<SOS> but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel , breaking forth in rank and not - to - be - endurèd riots . <EOS>|||<SOS> will damage your reputation with them — and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre . <EOS>

<SOS> the ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , the ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn propn rotted ere his youth attained a beard . <EOS>|||<SOS> so all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing , because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe . <EOS>

<SOS> if th ' other two be brained like us , the state totters . <EOS>|||<SOS> if the other two are as loopy as we are , our country ’ s in bad shape . <EOS>

<SOS> o , if thou be ’ st the same propn , speak , and speak unto the same propn . <EOS>|||<SOS> oh , if you are the same propn , speak now , and speak to that same propn ! <EOS>
<SOS> mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view . <EOS>|||<SOS> the sight made me so sick i could n ’ t watch any more . <EOS>

<SOS> he forbids it , being free from vainness and self - glorious pride , giving full trophy , signal , and ostent propn from himself , to propn . <EOS>|||<SOS> he refuses , as he is free of vanity and self - serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to propn . <EOS>

<SOS> and , for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorred commands , refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage , into a cloven pine , within which rift propn thou didst painfully remain a dozen years ; within which space she died and left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike . <EOS>|||<SOS> in a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree , with the help of her powerful assistants , and left you there for twelve years . <EOS>
<SOS> but i have cause to pry into this pedant . <EOS>|||<SOS> but there ’ s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster . <EOS>

<SOS> then half propn propn ’ s tongue in propn propn ’ s mouth , and half propn propn propn melancholy in propn propn ’ s face— with a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill . <EOS>|||<SOS> so , the man would talk half as much as propn and be half as serious as propn propn and if he were handsome , agile , and rich , too , he could have any woman in the world — all he ’ d need was her good will . <EOS>
